25084124,Differential expression of boule and dazl in adult germ cells of the Asian seabass.,"Dwarakanath M, Lim M, Xu H, Hong Y",Gene. 2014 Oct 10;549(2):237-42. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2014.07.068. Epub 2014 Jul 30.,"Fertility genes boule and dazl constitute the evolutionarily conserved DAZ (Deleted in AZoospermia) family of RNA binding proteins essential for germline development across animal phyla. Here we report the cloning and expression analysis of boule and dazl from the Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer), a marine fish that undergoes sequential male-to-female sex reversal. Molecular cloning and sequence comparison led to the identification of boule and dazl cDNAs. RT-PCR analysis showed that both boule and dazl RNAs were restricted to the gonads among adult organs examined. Chromogenic in situ hybridization revealed germ cell-specific expression for both boule and dazl in female and male adults. Importantly, distinct differences were found between boule and dazl in terms of temporospatial expression and subcellular distribution. The boule RNA was abundant in late gametogenic cells except sperm. Interestingly, dazl expression increases in early oocytes and concentrates in a perinuclear speckle that appears to develop ultimately into the Balbiani body in advanced oocytes. The dazl RNA was found to be abundant in spermatocytes but hardly detectable in sperm. These data demonstrate that boule and dazl are germ cell markers in the adult Asian seabass, and that bisexual germline-specific expression has been conserved for boule and dazl in fish."
24550690,Vasa identifies germ cells and critical stages of oogenesis in the Asian seabass.,"Xu H, Lim M, Dwarakanath M, Hong Y",Int J Biol Sci. 2014 Feb 6;10(2):225-35. doi: 10.7150/ijbs.6797. eCollection 2014.,"Germ cells produce sperm and eggs for reproduction and fertility. The Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer), a protandrous marine fish, undergoes male-female sex reversal and thus offers an excellent model to study the role of germ cells in sex differentiation and sex reversal. Here we report the cloning and expression of vasa as a first germ cell marker in this organism. A 2241-bp cDNA was cloned by PCR using degenerate primers of conserved sequences and gene-specific primers. This cDNA contains a polyadenylation signal and a full open reading frame for 645 amino acid residues, which was designated as Lcvasa for the seabass vasa, as its predicted protein is homologous to Vasa proteins. The Lcvasa RNA is maternally supplied and specific to gonads in adulthood. By chromogenic and fluorescent in situ hybridization we revealed germ cell-specific Lcvasa expression in both the testis and ovary. Importantly, Lcvasa shows dynamic patterns of temporospatial expression and subcellular distribution during gametogenesis. At different stages of oogenesis, for example, Lcvasa undergoes nuclear-cytoplasmic redistribution and becomes concentrated preferentially in the Balbiani body of stage-II~III oocytes. Thus, the vasa RNA identifies both female and male germ cells in the Asian seabass, and its expression and distribution delineate critical stages of gametogenesis."
21304996,Quantitative trait loci involved in sex determination and body growth in the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata L.) through targeted genome scan.,"Loukovitis D, Sarropoulou E, Tsigenopoulos CS, Batargias C, Magoulas A, Apostolidis AP, Chatziplis D, Kotoulas G",PLoS One. 2011 Jan 31;6(1):e16599. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0016599.,"Among vertebrates, teleost fish exhibit a considerably wide range of sex determination patterns that may be influenced by extrinsic parameters. However even for model fish species like the zebrafish Danio rerio the precise mechanisms involved in primary sex determination have not been studied extensively. The zebrafish, a gonochoristic species, is lacking discernible sex chromosomes and the sex of juvenile fish is difficult to determine. Sequential protandrous hermaphrodite species provide distinct determination of the gender and allow studying the sex determination process by looking at the mechanism of sex reversal. This is the first attempt to understand the genetic basis of phenotypic variation for sex determination and body weight in a sequential protandrous hermaphrodite species, the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). This work demonstrates a fast and efficient strategy for Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) detection in the gilthead sea bream, a non-model but target hermaphrodite fish species. Therefore a comparative mapping approach was performed to query syntenies against two other Perciformes, the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), a gonochoristic species and the Asian sea bass (Lates calcarifer) a protandrous hermaphrodite. In this manner two significant QTLs, one QTL affecting both body weight and sex and one QTL affecting sex, were detected on the same linkage group. The co-segregation of the two QTLs provides a genomic base to the observed genetic correlation between these two traits in sea bream as well as in other teleosts. The identification of QTLs linked to sex reversal and growth, will contribute significantly to a better understanding of the complex nature of sex determination in S. aurata where most individuals reverse to the female sex at the age of two years through development and maturation of the ovarian portion of the gonad and regression of the testicular area.
