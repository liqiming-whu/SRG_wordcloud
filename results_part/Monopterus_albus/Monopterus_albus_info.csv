32425902,Analysis of the Intestinal Flora in Male Versus Female Swamp Eels (Monopterus albus).,"Wang Y, Zhang J, Zhou Q, Wang Z, Gao M, Yang X, Liu Y, Zhang Z, Jiang W, Hu C, Zhang W",Front Microbiol. 2020 Apr 30;11:699. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2020.00699. eCollection 2020.,"This study aimed to analyze the intestinal flora of male versus female swamp eels, which have the unique characteristic of sex reversal. Same-aged swamp eels from the same parents, kept under the same conditions in terms of environment, diet, etc., were used as the study materials. After breeding for 1 year, 18 healthy swamp eels (nine males and nine females), weighing 39.4 +/- 2.3 g, were selected. The intestinal contents of three swamp eels of the same sex were combined and labeled as follows: FM1-FM3 (n = 3) for females and MM1-MM3 (n = 3) for males. High-throughput sequencing was used to research the v3-v4 region of 16S rDNA in the intestinal flora. The results suggested significant differences in the structure, composition, and diversity of the intestinal flora of male versus female swamp eels. The relative abundances of Actinobacteria and Spirochaetes in female swamp eels were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in male swamp eels at the phylum level. The relative abundances of Mycobacterium, Bacillus, and Vagococcus in female swamp eels were considerably higher (p < 0.05) than in male swamp eels at the genus level. The Alpha diversity of females was higher than that of males, and the Shannon index of females was also significantly higher (p < 0.05, Tukey's HSD) than that in males. Investigations of Beta diversity, including NMDS ordination, UPGMA cluster analysis, and PLS-DA analysis, showed that female and male swamp eels could be clearly distinguished based on significant differences in intestinal flora between the FM group and the MM group. LEfSe analysis showed that the dominant bacteria were Cetobacterium in male swamp eels and Clostridium_sp_ND2, Mycobacterium, Alphaproteobacteria, and Bacilli in female swamp eels. The results showed dramatic differences in the intestinal flora between the sexes, which indicates the need for a more in-depth study on sex reversal in the future."
32034539,Guppies show sex and individual differences in the ability to inhibit behaviour.,"Lucon-Xiccato T, Bisazza A, Bertolucci C",Anim Cogn. 2020 May;23(3):535-543. doi: 10.1007/s10071-020-01357-4. Epub 2020 Feb 7.,"In humans, individual and sex differences have been long reported for several cognitive tasks and are at least in part due to variability in the function that inhibits behaviour (i.e. inhibitory control). Similar evidence of individual and sex differences in inhibitory abilities is also present in other vertebrates, but is scarce outside primates. Experiments on reversal learning, which requires inhibiting behaviours, suggest that this variability may exist in a teleost fish, the guppy, Poecilia reticulata. We tested this hypothesis by observing guppies in an inhibitory task. Guppies were exposed to unreachable prey inside a transparent tube for six trials. Guppies showed a marked reduction in the number of attempts to catch the prey within the first trial and also over repeated trials. We found a striking sex difference in the capacity to inhibit foraging behaviour. Males attempted to attack the prey twice as often as females and showed negligible improvement over trials. Irrespective of sex, individuals remarkably differed in their performance, with some guppies being systematically more skilled than others across the repeated trials. These results confirm that individual and sex differences in the ability to inhibit behaviour are not restricted to humans and other primates, suggesting that they might be widespread among vertebrates. Variability in inhibitory ability provides an explanation for emerging records of variability in other cognitive tasks in fish."
31998563,Population genetics of swamp eel in the Yangtze River: comparative analyses between mitochondrial and microsatellite data provide novel insights.,"Zhou H, Hu Y, Jiang H, Duan G, Ling J, Pan T, Chen X, Wang H, Zhang Y",PeerJ. 2020 Jan 21;8:e8415. doi: 10.7717/peerj.8415. eCollection 2020.,"The swamp eel (Monopterus albus) is a typical sex reversal fish with high economic value. Several phylogeographic studies have been performed using various markers but comparative research between mitochondrial and nuclear markers is rare. Here, a fine-scale study was performed across six sites along the Yangtze River including three sites on the main stem and three sites from tributaries. A total of 180 swamp eel individuals were collected. Genetic structure and demographic history were explored using data from two mitochondrial genes and eight microsatellite loci. The results revealed the samples from tributary sites formed three separate clades which contained site-specific lineages. Geographic isolation and the habitat patchiness caused by seasonal cutoff were inferred to be the reasons for this differentiation. Strong gene flow was detected among the sites along the main stem. Rapid flow of the river main stem may provide the dynamic for the migration of swamp eel. Interestingly, the comparative analyses between the two marker types was discordant. Mitochondrial results suggested samples from three tributary sites were highly differentiated. However, microsatellite analyses indicated the tributary samples were moderately differentiated. We conclude this discordance is mainly caused by the unique life history of sex reversal fish. Our study provides novel insights regarding the population genetics of sex reversal fish."
31899193,Mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) are less sensitive to 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) than other common model teleosts: A comparative review of reproductive effects.,"Rutherford R, Lister A, Bosker T, Blewett T, Gillio Meina E, Chehade I, Kanagasabesan T, MacLatchy D",Gen Comp Endocrinol. 2020 Apr 1;289:113378. doi: 10.1016/j.ygcen.2019.113378. Epub 2019 Dec 31.,"The environmental estrogen 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) will depress or completely inhibit egg production in many common model teleosts at low concentrations (</=0.5 ng/L; Runnalls et al., 2015). This inhibition is not seen in the estuarine killifish, or mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), even when exposed to 100 ng/L EE2. This relative insensitivity to EE2 exposure indicates species-specific mechanisms for compensating for exogenous estrogenic exposure. This review compares various reproductive responses elicited by EE2 in mummichog to other common model teleosts, such as zebrafish (Danio rerio) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), identifying key endpoints where mummichog differ from other studied fish. For example, EE2 accumulates primarily in the liver/gall bladder of mummichog, which is different than zebrafish and fathead minnow in which accumulation is predominantly in the carcass. Despite causing species-specific differences in fecundity, EE2 has been shown to consistently induce hepatic vitellogenin in males and cause feminization/sex reversal during gonadal differentiation in larval mummichog, similar to other species. In addition, while gonadal steroidogenesis and plasma steroid levels respond to exogenous EE2, it is generally at higher concentrations than observed in other species. In mummichog, production of 17beta-estradiol (E2) by full grown ovarian follicles remains high; unlike other teleost models where E2 synthesis decreases as 17alpha,20beta-dihydroxy-4-prenen-3-on levels increase to induce oocyte maturation. New evidence in mummichog indicates some dissimilarity in gonadal steroidogenic gene expression responses compared to gene expression responses in zebrafish and fathead minnow exposed to EE2. The role of ovarian physiology continues to warrant investigation regarding the tolerance of mummichog to exogenous EE2 exposure. Here we present a comprehensive review, highlighting key biological differences in response to EE2 exposure between mummichog and other commonly used model teleosts."
31446680,Expression patterns of kiss2 and gpr54-2 in Monopterus albus suggest these genes may play a role in sex reversal in fish.,"Yi TL, Pei MT, Yang DQ",FEBS Open Bio. 2019 Oct;9(10):1835-1844. doi: 10.1002/2211-5463.12727. Epub 2019 Sep 10.,"Due to its exceptionally small genome size and protogynous hermaphroditism, Monopterus albus has been proposed as a model for vertebrate sexual development. The Kiss/GPR54 system is a central regulator of sexual development in most vertebrates, but its role in sex reversal remains hypothetical. In contrast to mammals, fishes often possess more than one copy of the kiss and gpr54 genes. Our objectives were to identify all kiss/gpr54 genes in the genome of M. albus and to assess their involvement in sex reversal via their expression patterns (qPCR) in females, males, and intersex specimens. We identified only two genes: kiss2 and gpr54-2. kiss2 expression was extremely high in the gonads of males, intermediate in females, and low in intersex; and reduced in all tissues of intersex. gpr54 expression was also extremely high in the gonads of males, high in intersex, but low in females. gpr54 expression in brain was high in all three sexes. In conclusion, (a) kiss1 has been functionally replaced in M. albus; (b) the functions of gpr54-2 in brain are not sex-specific; (c) kiss2 appears to undergo a 'reset' in the expression during the sex change; and (d) sex-specific expression patterns in the gonads indicate that these two genes may play a role in sex reversal in fish."
31412286,"Estrogen Receptor beta2 Oversees Germ Cell Maintenance and Gonadal Sex Differentiation in Medaka, Oryzias latipes.","Chakraborty T, Mohapatra S, Zhou LY, Ohta K, Matsubara T, Iguchi T, Nagahama Y",Stem Cell Reports. 2019 Aug 13;13(2):419-433. doi: 10.1016/j.stemcr.2019.07.013.,"In vertebrates, estrogen receptors are essential for estrogen-associated early gonadal sex development. Our previous studies revealed sexual dimorphic expression of estrogen receptor beta2 (ERbeta2) during embryogenesis of medaka, and here we investigated the functional importance of ERbeta2 in female gonad development and maintenance using a transgenerational ERbeta2-knockdown (ERbeta2-KD) line and ERbeta2-null mutants. We found that ERbeta2 reduction favored male-biased gene transcription, suppressed female-responsive gene expression, and affected SDF1a and CXCR4b co-assisted chemotactic primordial germ cell (PGC) migration. Co-overexpression of SDF1a and CXXR4b restored the ERbeta2-KD/KO associated PGC mismigration. Further analysis confirmed that curtailment of ERbeta2 increased intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, disrupted intra- and extracellular calcium homeostasis, and instigated autophagic germ cell degradation and germ cell loss, which in some cases ultimately affected the XX female sexual development. This study is expected improve our understanding of germ cell maintenance and sex spectrum, and hence open new avenues for reproductive disorder management."
31140678,Increase of cortisol levels after temperature stress activates dmrt1a causing female-to-male sex reversal and reduced germ cell number in medaka.,"Adolfi MC, Fischer P, Herpin A, Regensburger M, Kikuchi M, Tanaka M, Schartl M",Mol Reprod Dev. 2019 Oct;86(10):1405-1417. doi: 10.1002/mrd.23177. Epub 2019 May 29.,"In vertebrates, there is accumulating evidence that environmental factors as triggers for sex determination and genetic sex determination are not two opposing alternatives but that a continuum of mechanisms bridge those extremes. One prominent example is the model fish species Oryzias latipes which has a stable XX/XY genetic sex determination system, but still responds to environmental cues, where high temperatures lead to female-to-male sex reversal. However, the mechanisms behind are still unknown. We show that high temperatures increase primordial germ cells (PGC) numbers before they reach the genital ridge, which, in turn, regulates the germ cell proliferation. Complete ablation of PGCs led to XX males with germ cell less testis, whereas experimentally increased PGC numbers did not reverse XY genotypes to female. For the underlying molecular mechanism, we provide support for the explanation that activation of the dmrt1a gene by cortisol during early development of XX embryos enables this autosomal gene to take over the role of the male determining Y-chromosomal dmrt1bY."
30936180,The central nervous system acts as a transducer of stress-induced masculinization through corticotropin-releasing hormone B.,"Castaneda Cortes DC, Padilla LFA, Langlois VS, Somoza GM, Fernandino JI",Development. 2019 Apr 23;146(8). pii: dev.172866. doi: 10.1242/dev.172866.,"Exposure to environmental stressors, such as high temperature (HT), during early development of fish induces sex reversal of genotypic females. Nevertheless, the involvement of the brain in this process is not well clarified. In the present work, we investigated the mRNA levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone b (crhb) and its receptors (crhr1 and crhr2), and found that they were upregulated at HT during the crucial period of gonadal sex determination in medaka. In order to clarify their roles in sex reversal, biallelic mutants for crhr1 and crhr2 were produced by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Remarkably, biallelic mutants of both loci (crhr1 and crhr2) did not undergo female-to-male sex reversal upon exposure to HT. Inhibition of this process in double corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor mutants could be successfully rescued through the administration of the downstream effector of the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis, cortisol. Taken together, these results reveal for the first time that the CNS acts as a transducer of masculinization induced by thermal stress."

Epub 2019 Feb 23.,"Insertion and deletion (indel) mutations, which can trigger single nucleotide substitutions on the flanking regions of genes, may generate abundant materials for disease defense, reproduction, species survival and evolution. However, genetic and evolutionary mechanisms of indels remain elusive. We establish a comparative genome-transcriptome-alignment approach for a large-scale identification of indels in Monopterus population. Over 2000 indels in 1738 indel genes, including 1-21 bp deletions and 1-15 bp insertions, were detected. Each indel gene had approximately 1.1 deletions/insertions, and 2-4 alleles in population. Frequencies of deletions were prominently higher than those of insertions on both genome and population levels. Most of the indels led to in frame mutations with multiples of three and majorly occurred in non-domain regions, indicating functional constraint or tolerance of the indels. All indel genes showed higher expression levels than non-indel genes during sex reversal. Slide window analysis of global expression levels in gonads showed a significant positive correlation with indel density in the genome. Moreover, indel genes were evolutionarily conserved and evolved slowly compared to non-indel genes. Notably, population genetic structure of indels revealed divergent evolution of Monopterus population, as bottleneck effect of biogeographic isolation by Taiwan Strait, China."
30787482,Green light irradiation during sex differentiation induces female-to-male sex reversal in the medaka Oryzias latipes.,"Hayasaka O, Takeuchi Y, Shiozaki K, Anraku K, Kotani T",Sci Rep. 2019 Feb 20;9(1):2383. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-38908-w.,"This study investigated whether irradiation of a specific light wavelength could affect the sex differentiation of fish. We first found that the photoreceptor genes responsible for receiving red, green, and ultraviolet light were expressed in the eyes of medaka during the sex differentiation period. Second, we revealed that testes developed in 15.9% of genotypic females reared under green light irradiation. These female-to-male sex-reversed fish (i.e. neo-males) showed male-specific secondary sexual characteristics and produced motile sperm. Finally, progeny tests using the sperm of neo-males (XX) and eggs of normal females (XX) revealed that all F1 offspring were female, indicating for the first time in animals that irradiation with light of a specific wavelength can trigger sex reversal."
30682621,Molecular signaling pathways elicited by 17alpha-ethinylestradiol in Japanese medaka male larvae undergoing gonadal differentiation.,"Abdelmoneim A, Abdu A, Chen S, Sepulveda MS",Aquat Toxicol. 2019 Mar;208:187-195. doi: 10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.01.013. Epub 2019 Jan 16.,"Estrogenic contaminants released into water bodies are potentially affecting the reproduction of aquatic organisms. Exposure to 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), a synthetic estrogen agonist commonly found in sewage effluents, has been shown to cause gonadal changes in male gonochoristic fish ranging from gonadal intersex to complete sex reversal. Although these gonadal changes have been well studied in Japanese medaka Oryzias latipes, the molecular mechanisms behind them are poorly understood. Our objective was to study the signaling pathways elicited by exposure to different concentrations of EE2 in this species. Embryos and larvae were sexed by the presence of leucophores and dmy expression (only in males). Male medaka were exposed to two EE2 concentrations (30 and 300 ng/L) during their gonadal differentiation period (7-22 dpf). The transcriptome of larvae was analyzed using RNA sequencing followed by pathway analysis. Genes involved in sex differentiation and gonadal development (e.g., cldn19, ctbp1, hsd17b4) showed a female-like expression pattern in EE2-exposed males with some genes changing in expression in an EE2 concentration-dependent manner. However, not all genes known to be involved in sex differentiation and gonadal development (e.g., wnt4b) were altered by EE2. Several of the prominently affected signaling pathways involved genes associated with steroidogenesis, steroid receptor signaling and steroid metabolism, such as cyp2b3, cyp3b40, cyp1a, hsd17b4. We also report on novel genes and pathways affected that might play a role in gonadal changes, including several genes associated with FXR/RXR and LXR/RXR activation networks. This study is the first to examine the transcriptomic changes in male fish resulting from exposure to EE2 during the gonadal differentiation period, providing new insights on the signaling pathways involved in the development of gonadal changes in gonochoristic fish."
30572174,Altered non-reproductive behavior and feminization caused by developmental exposure to 17alpha-ethinylestradiol persist to adulthood in three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus).,"Porseryd T, Larsson J, Kellner M, Bollner T, Dinnetz P, Porsch Hallstrom I",Aquat Toxicol. 2019 Feb;207:142-152. doi: 10.1016/j.aquatox.2018.11.024. Epub 2018 Nov 28.,"The synthetic estrogen 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and commonly detected in sewage effluents, interferes with the endocrine system in multiple ways. Exposure during sensitive windows of development causes persistent effects on fertility, reproductive and non-reproductive behavior in mammals and fish. In the present study, three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were exposed to nominal 0 and 20 ng/L EE2 from fertilization to 7 weeks post-hatch. After 8 months of remediation in clean water three non-reproductive behaviors, not previously analyzed in developmentally EE2-exposed progeny of wild-caught fish, were evaluated. Chemical analysis revealed that the nominal 0 and 20 ng/L exposure contained 5 and 30 ng/L EE2, respectively. Therefore, the use of control fish from previous experiments was necessary for comparisons. Fish exposed during development showed significant concentration-dependent reduction in anxiety-like behavior in the scototaxis (light/dark preference) test by means of shorter latency to first entrance to the white compartment, more visits in white, and longer total time in white compared to unexposed fish. In the novel tank test, developmental exposure significantly increased the number of transitions to the upper half of the aquaria. Exposure to EE2 during development did not alter shoal cohesion in the shoaling test compared with unexposed fish but fish exposed to 30 ng/L EE2 had significantly longer latency to leave the shoal and fewer transitions away from the shoal compared to fish exposed to 5 ng/L EE2. Skewed sex ratio with more females, sex reversal in genetic males as well as intersex in males was observed after exposure to 30, but not 5 ng/L EE2. In conclusion, EE2 exposure during development in three-spined stickleback resulted in persistent effects on anxiety-like behaviors. These long-term effects from developmental exposure are likely to be of higher relevance for natural populations than are short-term effects from adult exposure."

A total of 157,834,590 cleaned reads were obtained and assembled into 129,268 transcripts and 31,764 could be annotated. Results showed that 176 up-regulated and 391 down-regulated transcripts were identified in the male seahorses compared with those in females. Genes involved in sex differentiation, such as dmrt1, sox9, fem1 and vasa, were identified and characterized. Moreover, the essential genes involved in reproductive molecular pathway were identified and analyzed in seahorses. In conclusion, the present study provides an archive for the future systematic research on seahorse sex differentiation."
29782841,"Alternative splicing of GnRH2 and GnRH2-associated peptide plays roles in gonadal differentiation of the rice field eel, Monopterus albus.","Feng K, Luo H, Hou M, Li Y, Chen J, Zhu Z, Hu W",Gen Comp Endocrinol. 2018 Oct 1;267:9-17. doi: 10.1016/j.ygcen.2018.05.021. Epub 2018 May 18.,"The rice field eel, Monopterus albus, is a protogynous hermaphrodite fish, in which the gonads are initially female ovaries which then transform into male testes. The exact mechanisms governing sex reversal in the rice field eel are unknown. In this study, a novel alternative splicing variant of GnRH2 (GnRH2-SV), retaining the second intron, was discovered in the gonad of the rice field eel. Compared to GnRH2, GnRH2-SV may give rise to a novel truncated GnRH2-associated peptide (New GAP2). The normal transcript of GnRH2 was primarily expressed in the brain, and could also be detected in the liver, spleen, ovary, and testis. However, GnRH2-SV was only expressed in the ovary and testis. During sex reversal, GnRH2 expression levels increased significantly at late stages; however, expression levels of GnRH2-SV were lower in ovary than in ovotestis and testis. We also examined the effect of three peptides (GnRHa, GAP2, and New GAP2) on gonadal sex differentiation during the third stage of ovarian development of the rice field eel. Compared to the control group, the expression of amh increased significantly following incubation with each of the three peptides. However, only New GAP2 stimulated the expression of sox9a1 mRNA in vitro. After intraperitoneal injection of GAP2, the expression of amh, foxl2, and cyp19a1a increased significantly after 12h; the concentration of serum 11-KT was also significantly increased at the 12h time point. Treatment with New GAP2 significantly increased the expression of amh, dmrt1a, and sox9a1, and also increased the concentration of serum 11-KT. After treated with GnRHa, the expression of amh, dmrt1a, sox9a1, cyp19a1a, and foxl2 increased significantly, as did the level of serum E2. These results indicated that both GAP2 and New GAP2 play a crucial role in inducing expression changes of sex-differentiation related genes, and may be involved in the gonadal development and sex reversal in the rice field eel."
29378592,Sox5 is involved in germ-cell regulation and sex determination in medaka following co-option of nested transposable elements.,"Schartl M, Schories S, Wakamatsu Y, Nagao Y, Hashimoto H, Bertin C, Mourot B, Schmidt C, Wilhelm D, Centanin L, Guiguen Y, Herpin A",BMC Biol. 2018 Jan 29;16(1):16. doi: 10.1186/s12915-018-0485-8.,"BACKGROUND: Sex determination relies on a hierarchically structured network of genes, and is one of the most plastic processes in evolution. The evolution of sex-determining genes within a network, by neo- or sub-functionalization, also requires the regulatory landscape to be rewired to accommodate these novel gene functions. We previously showed that in medaka fish, the regulatory landscape of the master male-determining gene dmrt1bY underwent a profound rearrangement, concomitantly with acquiring a dominant position within the sex-determining network. This rewiring was brought about by the exaptation of a transposable element (TE) called Izanagi, which is co-opted to act as a silencer to turn off the dmrt1bY gene after it performed its function in sex determination. RESULTS: We now show that a second TE, Rex1, has been incorporated into Izanagi. The insertion of Rex1 brought in a preformed regulatory element for the transcription factor Sox5, which here functions in establishing the temporal and cell-type-specific expression pattern of dmrt1bY. Mutant analysis demonstrates the importance of Sox5 in the gonadal development of medaka, and possibly in mice, in a dmrt1bY-independent manner. Moreover, Sox5 medaka mutants have complete female-to-male sex reversal. CONCLUSIONS: Our work reveals an unexpected complexity in TE-mediated transcriptional rewiring, with the exaptation of a second TE into a network already rewired by a TE. We also show a dual role for Sox5 during sex determination: first, as an evolutionarily conserved regulator of germ-cell number in medaka, and second, by de novo regulation of dmrt1 transcriptional activity during primary sex determination due to exaptation of the Rex1 transposable element."

Epub 2017 Sep 22.,"Sex-bias in gene expression is a widespread mechanism for controlling the development of phenotypes that differ between males and females. Most studies on sex-bias in gene expression have focused on species that exhibit traditional sex-roles (male-male competition and female parental care). By contrast the Syngnathid fishes (sea horses, pipefish, and sea dragons) are a group of organisms where many species exhibit male brooding and sex-role reversal (female-female competition for mates and paternal parental care), and little is known about how patterns of sex-bias in gene expression vary in species with sex-role reversal. Here we utilize RNA-seq technology to investigate patterns of sex-bias in gene expression in the brain tissue of the Gulf Pipefish (Syngnathus scovelli) a species that exhibits sex-role reversal. Gene expression analysis identified 73 sex-biased genes, 26 genes upregulated in females and 47 genes upregulated in males. Gene ontology analysis found 52 terms enriched for the sex-biased genes in a wide range of pathways suggesting that multiple functions and processes differ between the sexes. We focused on two areas of interest: sex steroids/hormones and circadian rhythms, both of which exhibited sex-bias in gene expression, and are known to influence sexual development in other species. Lastly, the work presented herein contributes to a growing body of genome data available for the Syngnathids, increasing our knowledge on patterns of gene expression in these unusual fishes."

Multiple triggers regulate the process of sexual differentiation including genetic or environmental factors (temperature, light, hormones and/or pH value, etc.). In recent years, with the advances of molecular technologies and genetic engineering approaches, there are significant breakthroughs in identifying the master genes of vertebrate sex determination and differentiation. In this review, we explore the fundamental and molecular mechanisms underlying the sexual differentiation in teleost fish, using medaka (Oryzias latipes) as a model. We focus on the male pathways and factors, particularly on dmrt1, gsdf and amh genes involved in testicular differentiation, sexual reversal and plasticity. It is anticipated that new techniques will likely be developed in the field of sex manipulations and monosex breeding for fish aquaculture in the future."

Epub 2017 Aug 8.,"In several mammalian and avian species, females show a higher performance than males in tasks requiring cognitive flexibility such as the discrimination reversal learning. A recent study showed that female guppies are twice as efficient as males in a reversal learning task involving yellow-red discrimination, suggesting a higher cognitive flexibility in female guppies. However, the possibility exists that the superior performance exhibited by females does not reflect a general sex difference in cognitive abilities, but instead, is confined to colour discrimination tasks. To address this issue, we compared male and female guppies in two different discrimination reversal learning tasks and we performed a meta-analysis of these experiments and the previous one involving colour discrimination. In the first experiment of this study, guppies were tested in a task requiring them to learn to select the correct arm of a T-maze in order to rejoin a group of conspecifics. In experiment 2, guppies were observed in a numerical task requiring them to discriminate between 5 and 10 dots in order to obtain a food reward. Although females outperformed males in one condition of the T-maze, we did not find any clear evidence of females' greater reversal learning performance in either experiment. However, the meta-analysis of the three experiments supported the hypothesis of females' greater reversal learning ability. Our data do not completely exclude the idea that female guppies have a generally higher cognitive flexibility than males; however, they suggest that the size of this sex difference might depend on the task."

Epub 2017 Jul 13.,"Although estrogens have been generally considered to play a critical role in ovarian differentiation in non-mammalian vertebrates, the specific functions of estrogens during ovarian differentiation remain unclear. We isolated two mutants with premature stops in the ovarian aromatase (cyp19a1) gene from an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-based gene-driven mutagenesis library of the medaka, Oryzias latipes. In XX mutants, gonads first differentiated into normal ovaries containing many ovarian follicles that failed to accumulate yolk. Subsequently, ovarian tissues underwent extensive degeneration, followed by the appearance of testicular tissues on the dorsal side of ovaries. In the newly formed testicular tissue, strong expression of gsdf was detected in sox9a2-positive somatic cells surrounding germline stem cells suggesting that gsdf plays an important role in testicular differentiation during estrogen-depleted female-to-male sex reversal. We conclude that endogenous estrogens synthesized after fertilization are not essential for early ovarian differentiation but are critical for the maintenance of adult ovaries."

Epub 2017 Jun 28.,"Gene expansion and contraction are important evolution events. Some tdrd genes, especially multi-Tudor members, participate in Piwi-interacting RNA pathway and spermatogenesis. However, tdrd evolution and their functions in teleost fish are poorly understood. Here, we identified 14 tdrds in the teleost fish, swamp eel, which were clustered into 12 tdrd branches. Comparative synteny showed biased duplications and loss of members in the tdrd family. Both tdrd6 and tdrd7 were duplicated in the teleost fish, whereas tdrd8 was lost from the original locus. Expression analysis at both RNA and protein levels showed that tdrd6l, a duplicated multi-Tudor member, was gonad enriched. Expression pattern of tdrd6l in follicular epithelium and seminiferous epithelium during sex reversal supports its potential role in genome defense in germline."

Epub 2017 Oct 18.,"The medaka extended one-generation test (MEOGRT) was developed as a multigenerational toxicity test for chemicals, particularly endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Briefly, 3 generations of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) are exposed to a chemical over a 20-wk period: 3 wk in the parental generation (F0), 15 wk in the first generation (F1), and 2 wk in the second generation (F2). The present study reports the first MEOGRT results concerning branched isomer mixtures of 4-nonylphenol (NP). Adult F0 medaka exposed to NP at 5 actual concentrations (1.27, 2.95, 9.81, 27.8, 89.4 microg/L) were unaffected in terms of reproduction, although vitellogenin in the male liver was increased dose-dependently at concentration of 2.95 microg/L and higher. In F1, in contrast, total egg (fecundity), fertile egg, and fertility decreased as NP increased; lowest-observed-effect concentrations (LOECs) for total egg, fertile egg, and fertility were 1.27, 1.27, 27.8 microg/L, respectively. In F1, but not in F0, secondary sex characteristics (i.e., anal fin papillae in males) were suppressed at 27.8 microg/L NP. Vitellogenin induction in adult male fish was slightly weaker in F1 than it was in F0, however. Gonadal sex abnormality and sex reversal occurred at 27.8 and 89.4 microg/L NP in F1 subadults. At 89.4 microg/L NP, all genotypic F1 males in breeding pairs had female phenotype, and some even demonstrated spawning. Concentrations of NP lower than 89.4 microg/L did not affect F2 survival or hatching. The highest detected NP level in environmental freshwater in Japan was approximately a half of the LOEC (1.27 microg/L for F1 fecundity); in other countries, however, environmental concentrations above the LOEC are reported, suggesting that NP may be affecting fish populations.

28319194,Genome-wide analysis of brain and gonad transcripts reveals changes of key sex reversal-related genes expression and signaling pathways in three stages of Monopterus albus.,"Chi W, Gao Y, Hu Q, Guo W, Li D",PLoS One. 2017 Mar 20;12(3):e0173974. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0173974. eCollection 2017.,"BACKGROUND: The natural sex reversal severely affects the sex ratio and thus decreases the productivity of the rice field eel (Monopterus albus). How to understand and manipulate this process is one of the major issues for the rice field eel stocking. So far the genomics and transcriptomics data available for this species are still scarce. Here we provide a comprehensive study of transcriptomes of brain and gonad tissue in three sex stages (female, intersex and male) from the rice field eel to investigate changes in transcriptional level during the sex reversal process. RESULTS: Approximately 195 thousand unigenes were generated and over 44.4 thousand were functionally annotated. Comparative study between stages provided multiple differentially expressed genes in brain and gonad tissue. Overall 4668 genes were found to be of unequal abundance between gonad tissues, far more than that of the brain tissues (59 genes). These genes were enriched in several different signaling pathways. A number of 231 genes were found with different levels in gonad in each stage, with several reproduction-related genes included. A total of 19 candidate genes that could be most related to sex reversal were screened out, part of these genes' expression patterns were validated by RT-qPCR. The expression of spef2, maats1, spag6 and dmc1 were abundant in testis, but was barely detected in females, while the 17beta-hsd12, zpsbp3, gal3 and foxn5 were only expressed in ovary. CONCLUSION: This study investigated the complexity of brain and gonad transcriptomes in three sex stages of the rice field eel. Integrated analysis of different gene expression and changes in signaling pathways, such as PI3K-Akt pathway, provided crucial data for further study of sex transformation mechanisms."

Epub 2015 Jun 4.,"Here, we used physiological and transcriptomic analyses to evaluate the effects of 17beta-trenbolone (TB) on metabolism during the early life stage of medaka (Oryzias latipes). In the physiological experiments, sex reversal rates increased continuously in proportion to TB concentrations (2-100 ng/L), and were 100% (all males) in the 200 ng/L treatment group. TB caused a significant increase in the gonadosomatic index of females at concentrations of 60 and 100 ng/L. These females exhibited swollen abdomens and decreased egg production and fertility. Significant increases were observed in the body mass index of these females. TB caused decreased fertility in males at concentrations >20 ng/L, but no other effects were observed. In the transcriptomic (microarray) experiments, larvae were exposed to TB for up to 7 d. Analyses using the KEGG Orthology Database revealed that predominant categories of significantly upregulated genes included ""lipid metabolism"" and ""metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides."" Thirteen genes (including those for hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase, cytoplasmic synthase, and lanosterol synthase) related to cholesterol biosynthesis via the mevalonate pathway were highlighted in these categories. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses were consistent with the microarray results, in terms of the direction and magnitude of change to gene expression. Among the downregulated genes, angiopoietin-like 4 and mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1, which are inversely correlated with obesity, were detected in the TB treatments. In conclusion, the results suggest that the exposure of females to TB during the early life stage may cause metabolic dysfunctions, including obesity and disrupted cholesterol synthesis.

However, Dmrt1 respectively becomes detectable at Stage 36 and 5 days post hatching (dph) in the two strains. In XX HNI-II embryos, 17alpha-methyltestosterone (MT) induces Gsdf mRNA from Stage 36, accompanied by complete sex-reversal in all treated individuals (MT, 10 ng/mL), while Dmrt1 mRNA was first detectable at 5 dph. In XX d-rR, MT induced Gsdf mRNA expression and sex-reversal in only some of the treated individuals. Together, these results suggest the testis differentiation cascade in XY individuals differs between the HNI-II and Hd-rR strains. In addition, it is suggested that androgen-induced XX sex-reversal proceeds via an androgen-Gsdf-Dmrt1 cascade and that Gsdf plays an important role in sex-reversal in medaka."

More recently perchlorate has been shown to affect primordial sexual differentiation in the aquatic model fishes zebrafish and threespine stickleback, but the mechanism has been unclear. Stickleback exposed to perchlorate from fertilization have increased androgen levels in the embryo and disrupted reproductive morphologies as adults, suggesting that perchlorate could disrupt the earliest stages of primordial sexual differentiation when primordial germ cells (PGCs) begin to form the gonad. Female stickleback have three to four times the number of PGCs as males during the first weeks of development. We hypothesized that perchlorate exposure affects primordial sexual differentiation by reducing the number of germ cells in the gonad during an important window of stickleback sex determination at 14-18 days post fertilization (dpf). We tested this hypothesis by quantifying the number of PGCs at 16 dpf in control and 100 mg/L perchlorate-treated male and female stickleback. Perchlorate exposure from the time of fertilization resulted in significantly reduced PGC number only in genotypic females, suggesting that the masculinizing effects of perchlorate observed in adult stickleback may result from early changes to the number of PGCs at a time critical for sex determination. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of a connection between an endocrine disruptor and reduction in PGC number prior to the first meiosis during sex determination. These findings suggest that a mode of action of perchlorate on adult reproductive phenotypes in vertebrates, including humans, such as altered fecundity and sex reversal or intersex gonads, may stem from early changes to germ cell development."

Here, we used a novel RNAi to characterise the molecular mechanism of Dmy (the sex-determining gene of medaka)-mediated masculinity in XY fish. Dmy knockdown (Dmy-KD) suppressed male pathway (Gsdf, Sox9a2, etc.) and favoured female cascade (Rspo1, etc.) in embryonic XY gonads, resulting in a fertile male-to-female sex-reversal. Gsdf, Sox9a2, and Rspo1 directly interacted with Dmy, and co-injection of Gsdf and Sox9a2 re-established masculinity in XY-Dmy-KD transgenics, insinuating that Dmy initiates masculinity by stimulating and suppressing Gsdf/Sox9a2 and Rspo1 expression, respectively. Gonadal expression of Wt1a starts prior to Dmy and didn't change upon Dmy-KD. Furthermore, Wt1a stimulated the promoter activity of Dmy, suggesting Wt1a as a regulator of Dmy. These findings provide new insights into the role of vertebrate sex-determining genes associated with the molecular interplay between the male and female pathways."

Here, we assembled improved TALENs targeting the DMY gene and generated XY(DMY-) mutants to investigate gonadal dysgenesis in medaka. DMY-TALENs resulted in indel mutations at the targeted loci (46.8%). DMY-nanos3UTR-TALENs induced mutations were passed through the germline to F1 generation with efficiencies of up to 91.7%. XY(DMY-) mutants developed into females, laid eggs, and stably passed the Y(DMY-) chromosome to next generation. RNA-seq generated 157 million raw reads from WT male (WT_M_TE), WT female (WT_F_OV) and XY(DMY-) female medaka (TA_F_OV) gonad libraries. Differential expression analysis identified 144 up- and 293 down-regulated genes in TA_F_OV compared with WT_F_OV, 387 up- and 338 down-regulated genes in TA_F_OV compared with WT_M_TE. According to genes annotation and functional prediction, such as Wnt1 and PRCK, it revealed that incomplete ovarian function and reduced fertility of XY(DMY-) mutant is closely related to the wnt signaling pathway. Our results provided the transcriptional profiles of XY(DMY-) mutants, revealed the mechanism between sex reversal and DMY in medaka, and suggested that XY(DMY-) medaka was a novel mutant that is useful for investigating gonadal dysgenesis in phenotypic female patients with the 46, XY karyotype."

MS/MS analysis revealed a group of differentially expressed proteins during ovary to ovotestis to testis transformation. Cbx3 is up-regulated during gonad reversal and is likely to have a role in spermatogenesis. Rab37 is down-regulated during the reversal and is mainly associated with oogenesis. Both Cbx3 and Rab37 are linked up in a protein network. These datasets in gonadal proteomes provide a new resource for further studies in gonadal development."

An alignment of known Foxl2 amino-acid sequences confirmed the conservation of the Foxl2 open reading frame, especially the forkhead domain and C-terminal region. The expression of Foxl2 was detected in the brain, eyes, and gonads. A high level of Foxl2 expression in the ovary before sex reversal, but its transcripts decreased sharply when the gonad developed into the ovotestis and testis. The correlation between the Foxl2 expression and the process of sex development revealed the important function of Foxl2 during the sex reversal of M. albus. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that Foxl2 was expressed abundantly in granulosa cells and in the interstitial cells of the ovotestis and testis. These results suggest that Foxl2 plays a pivotal role in the development and maintenance of ovarian function. Foxl2 may be also involved in the early development of testis and the development of ocular structures of M. albus."

Epub 2014 Sep 18.,"Sex determination can be robustly genetic, strongly environmental, or genetic subject to environmental perturbation. The genetic basis of sex determination is unknown for zebrafish (Danio rerio), a model for development and human health. We used RAD-tag population genomics to identify sex-linked polymorphisms. After verifying this ""RAD-sex"" method on medaka (Oryzias latipes), we studied two domesticated zebrafish strains (AB and TU), two natural laboratory strains (WIK and EKW), and two recent isolates from nature (NA and CB). All four natural strains had a single sex-linked region at the right tip of chromosome 4, enabling sex genotyping by PCR. Genotypes for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with the strongest statistical association to sex suggested that wild zebrafish have WZ/ZZ sex chromosomes. In natural strains, ""male genotypes"" became males and some ""female genotypes"" also became males, suggesting that the environment or genetic background can cause female-to-male sex reversal. Surprisingly, TU and AB lacked detectable sex-linked loci. Phylogenomics rooted on D. nigrofasciatus verified that all strains are monophyletic. Because AB and TU branched as a monophyletic clade, we could not rule out shared loss of the wild sex locus in a common ancestor despite their independent domestication. Mitochondrial DNA sequences showed that investigated strains represent only one of the three identified zebrafish haplogroups. Results suggest that zebrafish in nature possess a WZ/ZZ sex-determination mechanism with a major determinant lying near the right telomere of chromosome 4 that was modified during domestication. Strains providing the zebrafish reference genome lack key components of the natural sex-determination system but may have evolved variant sex-determining mechanisms during two decades in laboratory culture."

Epub 2014 May 30.,"FSH, a glycoprotein hormone, is circulated from the pituitary and functions by binding to a specific FSH receptor (FSHR). FSHR is a G protein-coupled, seven-transmembrane receptor linked to the adenylyl cyclase or other pathways and is expressed in gonadal somatic cells. In some nonmammalian species, fshr expression is much higher in the ovary than in the testis during gonadal sex differentiation, suggesting that FSHR is involved in ovarian development in nonmammalian vertebrates. However, little is known of FSHR knockout phenotypes in these species. Here we screened for fshr mutations by a medaka (Oryzias latipes) target-induced local lesion in the genomes and identified one nonsense mutation located in the BXXBB motif, which is involved in G protein activation. Next, we used an in vitro reporter gene assay to demonstrate that this mutation prevents FSHR function. We then analyzed the phenotypes of fshr mutant medaka. The fshr mutant male medaka displayed normal testes and were fertile, whereas the mutant female fish displayed small ovaries and were infertile because vitellogenesis was inhibited. The mutant females also have suppressed expression of ovary-type aromatase (cyp19a1a), a steroidogenic enzyme responsible for the conversion of androgens to estrogens, resulting in decreased 17beta-estradiol levels. Moreover, loss of FSHR function caused female-to-male sex reversal in some cases. In addition, the transgenic overexpression of fshr in fshr mutants rescued FSHR function. These findings strongly suggest that in the medaka, FSH regulates the ovarian development and the maintenance mainly by the elevation of estrogen levels. We present the first FSHR knockout phenotype in a nonmammalian species."

Epub 2014 Mar 31.,"Vasa is a highly conserved ATP-dependent RNA helicase expressed mainly in germ cells. The vasa gene plays a crucial role in the development of germ cell lineage and has become an excellent molecular marker in identifying germ cells in teleosts. However, little is known about the structure and function of the vasa gene in flatfish. In this study, the vasa gene (Csvasa) was isolated and characterized in half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis), an economically important flatfish in China. In the obtained 6425-bp genomic sequence, 23 exons and 22 introns were identified. The Csvasa gene encodes a 663-amino acid protein, including highly conserved domains of the DEAD-box protein family. The amino acid sequence also shared a high homology with other teleosts. Csvasa expression was mainly restricted to the gonads, with little or no expression in other tissues. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that Csvasa expression levels decreased during embryonic and early developmental stages and increased with the primordial germ cell proliferation. A typical sexually dimorphic expression pattern of Csvasa was observed during early development and sex differentiation, suggesting that the Csvasa gene might play a differential role in the proliferation and differentiation of male and female primordial germ cells (PGCs). Csvasa mRNA expression levels in neomales were significantly lower than those in normal males and females, indicating that the Csvasa gene might be implicated in germ cell development after sex reversal by temperature treatment. In addition, medaka (Oryzias latipes) PGCs could be transiently labeled by microinjection of synthesized mRNA containing the green fluorescence protein gene and 3'-untranslated region of Csvasa, which confirmed that the Csvasa gene has the potential to be used as a visual molecular marker of germ cells and laid a foundation for manipulation of PGCs in tongue sole reproduction."

Epub 2014 Feb 26.,"The objective of this study was to investigate gene transcription profiles of the stage IV ovary and the ovotestis of the rice field eel (Monopterus albus) in an attempt to uncover genes involved in sex reversal and gonad development. Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) libraries were constructed using mRNA from the stage IV ovary and the ovotestis. In total 100 positive clones from the libraries were selected at random and sequenced, and then expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were used to search against sequences in the GenBank database using the BLASTn and BLASTx search algorithms. High quality SSH cDNA libraries and 90 ESTs were obtained. Of these ESTs, 43 showed high homology with genes of known function and these are associated with energy metabolism, signal transduction, transcription regulation and so on. The remaining 47 ESTs shared no homology with any genes in GenBank and are thus considered to be hypothetical genes. Furthermore, the four genes F11, F63, R11, and R47 from the forward and reverse libraries were analyzed in gonad, brain, heart, spleen, liver, kidney and muscle tissues. The results showed that the transcription of the F11 and F63 genes was significantly increased while the expression of the R11 and R47 genes was significantly decreased from IV or V ovary. In addition, the results also indicated that the four genes' expression was not gonad-tissue specific. This results strongly suggested that they may be involved in the rice field eel gonad development and/or sex reversal."

Phylogenetic tree showed that these genes are clustered into corresponding branches of the DM genes in vertebrates. Southern blot analysis indicated that the Dmrt1-Dmrt3-Dmrt2 genes are tightly linked in a conserved gene cluster. Notably, these Dmrt genes are up-regulated during gonad transformation. Furthermore, mRNA in situ hybridisation showed that Dmrt2, Dmrt3, Dmrt4 and Dmrt5 are expressed in developing germ cells. These results are evidence that the DM genes are involved in sexual differentiation in the swamp eel."

At the early life stage, fertilized eggs were exposed to 5, 50, 500, 5000ng/L E3 for 15days, and the hatched fry were exposed continuously to the same concentrations for an additional 15days. Exposure to 500 and 5000ng/L E3 resulted in adverse effects on hatchability and time to hatching. At 5000ng/L, the gross abnormality rate was increased and the number of females that hatched was twice that of males. When the fish were exposed to 5-5000ng/L E3 for further 60days, the male hepatosomatic index (HSI) was increased at 5000ng/L. The female gonadosomatic index (GSI) was decreased at 500 and 5000ng/L E3, while the male GSI at 5000ng/L E3 was increased and sex reversal was also found at this concentration. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the hepatic vitellogenin-I (Vtg-I) genes were up-regulated in females at 500 and 5000ng/L E3 and in males at all E3 concentrations, whereas E3 did not affect estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) mRNA transcription. These results showed that E3 at environmental concentration of 5ng/L has no adverse effects on growth and development of the Japanese medaka. However, in this study, if we only focused on Vtg gene change in males, E3 had strong estrogenic effects on male medaka under the conditions of these experiments."

The results showed that among juveniles aged 5 to 10 days, the gonad located on the right side of the dorsal abdominal cavity and the germ cells was significantly larger than the surrounding somatic cells. Ten days after hatching, sexual differences between females and males became obvious, and germline cysts derived from oogonium division were present in the gonad. At 50 days after hatching, ovarian cavities and mature sperm were observed. Moreover, during the study we also observed the coexistence of two sexual characteristics during a male's development. Together, these observations fill current gaps in developmental and genetic biology that will allow a more efficient use of Medaka as an experimental model."

Syngnathids exhibit a variety of genetic mating patterns, making them an ideal group to test predictions of sexual selection theory. Here, we describe the mating system of the black-striped pipefish Syngnathus abaster, using 4 highly variable microsatellites to analyze parentage of 102 embryos. Results revealed that 1) both sexes mate multiple times over the course of a pregnancy (polygynandrous mating system), 2) eggs are spatially segregated by maternity within each brood pouch, and 3) larger females have higher mating success (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; P < 0.05). Together with similar studies of other syngnathid species, our results support the hypothesis that the mating system is related to the intensity of sexual dimorphism."

Epub 2013 Jul 3.,"The fertilized eggs of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) were exposed to estrone (E1) at 5-5000 ng L(-1) for 15 d, and the hatched fry were exposed continuously to the same concentrations for the additional 15 d. Adverse effects on hatchability, time to hatching, and gross abnormalities occurred at 50 ng L(-1) or above. Then the fry were divided into a continual exposure group, and a water recovery group. When the fry were exposed to E1 for another 60 d, there was a decrease in the hepatosomatic index (HSI) of males and the influence disappeared in the water recovery group. The gonadosonatic index (GSI) of females at 500 ng L(-1) decreased significantly in another 60 d exposure. While the fry were maintained in dechlorinated tap water for 60 d, a significant decrease in female GSI was observed at 50 ng L(-1) or above. An increased GSI was found in males in both continual exposure and water recovery groups at all E1 treatments. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that vitellogenin-I (Vtg-I) gene expressions in the female liver were significantly down-regulated at 50 ng L(-1) in the continual exposure group, and at 500 ng L(-1) in the water recovery group, while male Vtg-I genes were significantly up-regulated for all E1 treatments. In addition, all E1 treatments caused sex reversal of males. These results suggest that E1 at 5 ng L(-1) or above have unrecoverable impacts on the gonadal growth and development of medaka, even if only early life stages were exposed to E1."

Epub 2013 May 29.,"Accurate genotyping of sex is required for correct interpretation in any in vivo assays with endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Visible markers for genotypic sex, if reliable, simplify assays because time-consuming PCR-based genotyping can be skipped. Here, we describe a line of Japanese medaka with a brain-expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene inserted near the sex-determining locus. When used with a white pigment cell marker, genotypic sex can be determined reliably as early as 3 days after fertilization (well before gonadal sex differentiation). No recombinants were found in more than 2000 progenies. We also introduced a strong ovarian GFP marker into the line with these genetic sex markers, so that phenotypic sex can also be determined reliably at 8 days after hatching. Well-known sex reversal protocols using exogenous steroid treatments of embryos were monitored by this transgenic line, demonstrating the line to be a useful tool for in vivo studies utilizing gonadal sex differentiation of the medaka, especially for screenings of potential estrogenic and androgenic EDCs."

Although EV is known as an estrogenic chemical, there is still a lack of data on its developmental and reproductive toxicities in fish following exposure to EV during embryo-larval-, juvenile- and adult-life stages in Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). At the early life stage, the fertilized eggs of medaka were exposed to 1, 10, 100 and 1000 ng/L EV for 15 days, and hatched larval fish were continually exposed to the same concentration range for an additional 15 days. The results showed that exposure to 10 ng/L or above resulted in adverse effects on hatchability and time to hatching, and the number of hatched females was twice that of males at 10 ng/L or above. When the hatched fish were continually exposed to 1, 10 and 100 ng/L of EV for another 40 days, the hepatosomatic index (HSI) was increased in both males and females, and the gonadosomatic index (GSI) was decreased in females, and increased in males. Sex reversal was found in fish exposed to 1 ng/L and above. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed that mRNA levels of estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) and vitellogenin-I (VTG-I) in the liver of females were significantly down-regulated, while those of vitellogenin-I (VTG-I) in the liver of males were significantly up-regulated at all concentrations. These findings suggest that EV is a reproductive toxicant and estrogenic chemical in both male and female fish."

Epub 2013 Jan 23.,"Condition-specific competition is widespread in nature. Species inhabiting heterogeneous environments tend to differ in competitive abilities depending on environmental stressors. Interactions between these factors can allow coexistence of competing species, which may be particularly important between invasive and native species. Here, we examine the effects of temperature on competitive interactions between invasive mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, and an endemic Iberian toothcarp, Aphanius iberus. We compare the tendency to approach heterospecifics and food capture rates between these two species, and examine differences between sexes and species in aggressive interactions, at three different temperatures (19, 24 and 29 degrees C) in three laboratory experiments. Mosquitofish exhibit much more aggression than toothcarp. We show that mosquitofish have the capacity to competitively displace toothcarp through interference competition and this outcome is more likely at higher temperatures. We also show a reversal in the competitive hierarchy through reduced food capture rate by mosquitofish at lower temperatures and suggest that these two types of competition may act synergistically to deprive toothcarp of food at higher temperatures. Males of both species carry out more overtly aggressive acts than females, which is probably related to the marked sexual dimorphism and associated mating systems of these two species. Mosquitofish may thus impact heavily on toothcarp, and competition from mosquitofish, especially in warmer summer months, may lead to changes in abundance of the native species and displacement to non-preferred habitats. Globally increasing temperatures mean that highly invasive, warm-water mosquitofish may be able to colonize environments from which they are currently excluded through reduced physiological tolerance to low temperatures. Research into the effects of temperature on interactions between native and invasive species is thus of fundamental importance."

Epub 2012 Dec 26.,"Environmental estrogens are ubiquitous in the environment and can cause detrimental effects on male reproduction. In fish, a multitude of effects from environmental estrogens have been observed including altered courting behavior and fertility, sex reversal, and gonadal histopathology. However, few studies in fish assess the impacts of estrogenic exposure on a physiological endpoint, such as reproduction, as well as the associated morphologic response and underlying global gene expression changes. This study assessed the implications of a 14 day sub-chronic exposure of ethinylestradiol (EE2; 1.0 or 10.0 microg/L EE2) on male medaka fertility, testicular histology and testicular gene expression. The findings demonstrate that a 14 day exposure to EE2 induced impaired male reproductive capacity and time- and dose-dependent alterations in testicular morphology and gene expression. The average fertilization rate/day following the exposure for control, 1.0 and 10.0 microg/L EE2 was 91.3% (+/-4.4), 62.8% (+/-8.3) and 28.8% (+/-5.8), respectively. The testicular morphologic alterations included increased germ cell apoptosis, decreased germinal epithelium and thickening of the interstitium. These changes were highly associated with testicular gene expression changes using a medaka-specific microarray. A pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes emphasized genes and pathways associated with apoptosis, cell cycle and proliferation, collagen production/extracellular matrix organization, hormone signaling, male reproduction and protein ubiquitination among others. These findings highlight the importance of anchoring global gonadal gene expression changes with morphology and ultimately with tissue/organ function."

Epub 2013 Jan 2.,"The brains of teleost fish exhibit remarkable sexual plasticity throughout their life span. To dissect the molecular basis for the development and reversal of sex differences in the teleost brain, we screened for genes differentially expressed between sexes in the brain of medaka (Oryzias latipes). One of the genes identified in the screen as being preferentially expressed in females was found to be a new member of the heme-binding protein gene family that includes hebp1 and hebp2 and was designated here as hebp3. The medaka hebp3 is expressed in the meninges with higher abundance in females, whereas there is no expression within the brain parenchyma. This female-biased expression of hebp3 is not attributable to the direct action of sex chromosome genes but results from the transient and reversible action of estrogens derived from the ovary. Moreover, estrogens directly activate the transcription of hebp3 via a palindromic estrogen-responsive element in the hebp3 promoter. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that hebp3 is a novel transcriptional target of estrogens, with female-biased expression in the meninges. The definite but reversible sexual dimorphism of the meningeal hebp3 expression may contribute to the development and reversal of sex differences in the teleost brain."

Epub 2012 Oct 31.,"In vertebrates, maternal transfer of immunity via the eggs or placenta provides offspring with crucial information on prevailing pathogens and parasites. Males contribute little to such transgenerational immune priming, either because they do not share the environment and parasite pressure of the offspring or because sperm are too small for transfer of immunity. In the teleost group of Syngnathids (pipefish, seahorses, and sea dragons), males brood female eggs in a placenta-like structure. Such sex-role-reversed species provide a unique opportunity to test for adaptive plasticity in immune transfer. Here, males and females should both influence offspring immunity. We experimentally tested paternal effects on offspring immunity by examining immune cell proliferation and immune gene expression. Maternal and paternal bacterial exposure induced offspring immune defense 5 weeks after hatching, and this effect persisted in 4-month-old offspring. For several offspring immune traits, double parental exposure (maternal and paternal) enhanced the response, whereas for another group of immune traits, the transgenerational induction already took place if only one parent was exposed. Our study shows that sex role reversal in connection with male pregnancy opens the door for biparental influences on offspring immunity and may represent an additional advantage for the evolution of male pregnancy."

Epub 2012 Sep 13.,"Global change is associated with fast and severe alterations of environmental conditions. Superimposed onto existing salinity variations in a semi-enclosed brackish water body such as the Baltic Sea, a decrease in salinity is predicted due to increased precipitation and freshwater inflow. Moreover, we predict that heavy precipitation events will accentuate salinity fluctuations near shore. Here, we investigated how the immune function of the broad-nosed pipefish (Syngnathus typhle), an ecologically important teleost with sex-role reversal, is influenced by experimentally altered salinities (control: 18 PSU, lowered: 6 PSU, increased: 30 PSU) upon infection with bacteria of the genus Vibrio. Salinity changes resulted in increased activity and proliferation of immune cells. However, upon Vibrio infection, individuals at low salinity were unable to mount specific immune response components, both in terms of monocyte and lymphocyte cell proliferation and immune gene expression compared to pipefish kept at ambient salinities. We interpret this as resource allocation trade-off, implying that resources needed for osmoregulation under salinity stress are lacking for subsequent activation of the immune defence upon infection. Our data suggest that composition of small coastal fish communities may change due to elevated environmental stress levels and the incorporated consequences thereof."

Epub 2012 Sep 14.,"Medaka (Oryzias latipes) is a teleost fish with an XX/XY sex determination system. Recently, it was reported that XX medaka can be sex-reversed into phenotypic males by exposure to high water temperature (HT) during gonadal sex differentiation, possibly by elevation of cortisol, the major glucocorticoid produced by the interrenal cells in teleosts. Yet, it remains unclear how the elevation of cortisol levels by HT causes female-to-male sex reversal. This paper reports that exposure to cortisol or HT after hatching inhibited both the proliferation of female-type germ cells and the expression of ovarian-type aromatase (cyp19a1), which encodes a steroidogenic enzyme responsible for the conversion of androgens to estrogens, and induced the expression of gonadal soma-derived growth factor (gsdf) in XX gonads during gonadal sex differentiation. In contrast, exposure to either cortisol or HT in combination with 17beta-estradiol (E2) did not produce these effects. Moreover, E2 completely rescued cortisol- and HT-induced masculinization of XX medaka. These results strongly suggest that cortisol and HT cause female-to-male sex reversal in medaka by suppression of cyp19a1 expression, with a resultant inhibition of estrogen biosynthesis. This mechanism may be common among animals with temperature-dependent sex determination."

Epub 2012 May 23.,"The function of AMH (Anti-Mullerian hormone), a phylogenetically ancient member of the TGFbeta family of proteins, in lower vertebrates is largely unknown. Previously, we have shown that the gene encoding the type II anti-Mullerian hormone receptor, amhrII, is responsible for excessive germ cell proliferation and male-to-female sex reversal in the medaka hotei mutant. In this study, functional analyses in cultured cells and of other amhrII mutant alleles indicate that lack of AMH signaling causes the hotei phenotype. BrdU incorporation experiments identified the existence of both quiescent and mitotically active germ cells among the self-renewing, type I population of germ cells in the developing gonad. AMH signaling acts in supporting cells to promote the proliferation of mitotically active germ cells but does not trigger quiescent germ cells to proliferate in the developing gonad. Furthermore, we show that the male-to-female sex reversal phenotype in hotei mutants is not a direct consequence of AMH signaling in supporting cells, but is instead mediated by germ cells. Our data demonstrate that interfollicular AMH signaling regulates proliferation at a specific stage of germ cell development, and that this regulation is crucial for the proper manifestation of gonadal sex directed by sex determination genes."

It was experimented recently to understand the effect and mechanism on mono sex production in Poecilia latipinna. It would help to develop a new eco-friendly way to masculinize P. latipinna, since males have higher commercial value than females. The different concentration (100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 mg/L) of T. terrestris extract and a control were tested for their effect on sex transformation/reversal in P. latipinna by immersing the newly born young ones in the respective concentrations for 2 mo. The obtained results indicate that a dose dependant masculinization is obtained due to T. terrestris administration, which improved the male proportion. Histological results revealed that the testes of fish treated with T. terrestris extract contained all stages of spermatogenesis, clearly demonstrating that the administration of T. terrestris extract to P. latipinna stimulated spermatogenesis. Thus, it is discernible that 0-d-old hatchlings of P. latipinna exposed to T. terrestris extract orient/reverse their sex more towards maleness besides yielding better growth and spermatogenesis which is a mandate for fancy fish industry."

Epub 2012 Jan 12.,"The sex determining gene is divergent among different animal species. However, sox9 is up-regulated in the male gonads in a number of species in which it is the essential regulator of testis determination. It is therefore often discussed that the sex determining gene-sox9 axis functions in several vertebrates. In our current study, we show that sox9b in the medaka (Oryzias latipes) is one of the orthologues of mammalian Sox9 at syntenic and expression levels. Medaka sox9b affects the organization of extracellular matrices, which represents a conserved role of sox9, but does not directly regulate testis determination. We made this determination via gene expression and phenotype analyses of medaka with different copy numbers of sox9b. Sox9b is involved in promoting cellular associations and is indispensible for the proper proliferation and survival of germ cells in both female and male medaka gonads. Medaka mutants that lack sox9b function exhibit a seemingly paradoxical phenotype of sex reversal to male. This is explained by a reduction in the germ cell number associated with aberrant extracellular matrices. Together with its identified roles in other vertebrate gonads, a testis-determining role for Sox9 in mammals is likely to have been neofunctionalized and appended to its conserved role in germ cell maintenance."

Although medaka sex is determined by the presence or absence of the Y chromosome-specific gene Dmy, we demonstrated that in one Dmrt1 mutant line, which was found by screening a gene-driven mutagenesis library, XY mutants developed into normal females and laid eggs. Histological analyses of this mutant revealed that the XY mutant gonads first developed into the normal testis type. However, the gonads transdifferentiated into the ovary type. The mutant phenotype could be rescued by transgenesis of the Dmrt1 genomic region. These results show that Dmrt1 is essential to maintain testis differentiation after Dmy-triggered male differentiation pathway."

Progress in these areas has been hampered by the small size of most species in the family and a lack of validated techniques for assessing endocrine function. Research on a relatively small number of species has suggested that androgens are likely regulators of spermatogenesis and the development of the male brood pouch prior to pregnancy whereas prolactin and corticosteroids synergistically promote brood pouch function during pregnancy. No evidence supports a reversal of reproductive steroid hormone function in sex-role reversed behaviour, but neuropeptides such as arginine vasotocin or isotocin should be examined for their role in regulating parturition and mating behaviour. The diversity of reproductive patterns exhibited by syngnathids suggests that they will provide a unique opportunity to assess how hormonal regulation of integumentary function, gametogenesis and reproductive behaviour have evolved within a teleost lineage. Additionally, their coastal distribution and embryo retention make them potentially important subjects for studies on the effect of endocrine disruption on fitness."

Epub 2011 Apr 15.,"Male pregnancy in the family Syngnathidae (pipefishes, seahorses and seadragons) predisposes males to limit female reproductive success; sexual selection may then operate more strongly on females and female sexual signals may evolve (sex-role reversal). A bewildering array of female signals has evolved in Syngnathids, e.g. skin folds, large body size, colouration, markings on the body and elaborate courtship. These female sexual signals do not seem quantitatively or qualitatively different from those that evolve in males in species with conventional sex roles where males provide females or offspring with direct benefits. In several syngnathid species, males also evolve ornaments, females are choosy in addition to being competitive and males compete as well as choosing partners. Thus, sex roles form a continuum, spanning from conventional to reversed within this group of fishes. Cases are presented here suggesting that stronger sexual selection on females may be most extreme in species showing classical polyandry (one male mates with several females, such as many species where males brood their eggs on the trunk), intermediate in polygynandrous species (males and females both mate with more than one partner, as in many species where males brood their eggs on the tail) and least extreme, even exhibiting conventional sex roles, in monogamous species (one male mates solely with one female, as in many seahorses and tropical pipefishes). At the same time caution is needed before unanimously establishing this pattern: first, the connection between mating patterns, strength of sexual selection, sex roles and ornament expression is far from simple and straightforward, and second, knowledge of the actual morphology, ecology and behaviour of most syngnathid species is scanty. Basically only a few Nerophis, Syngnathus and Hippocampus species have been studied in any detail. It is known, however, that this group of fishes exhibits a remarkable variation in sex roles and ornamentation, making them an ideal group for the study of mating patterns, sexual selection and sexually selected signals."

From 0 days post-hatch (0 dph) onwards, juveniles were exposed to graded concentrations of EE(2) (25.2-1710 ng/L) for 35 days. The gonads of live specimens were monitored by measuring their size and calculating their GFP-fluorescence area. GFP-fluorescent area in control females was about 10 times that in control males at 10 days posthatch (dph) whereas the gonadal size of 10 dph males that had been exposed to 158 ng/L of EE(2) significantly increased up to twice the size of control males, indicating that abnormal sexual differentiation towards female might occur in these individuals. Histological examination and identification of the sex-linked marker SL1 indicated that male to female sex reversal occurred at EE(2) exposure >/=45.1 ng/L at 35 dph. These results suggest that observation of proliferative activity of germ cells in the olvas-GFP/STII-YI strain could be applied to facilitated screening fish model to detect adverse effects on sexual differentiation as early as 10 dph juveniles."

In this study, we used another O. latipes inbred strain (HNI) for the mating, and found that 23% of XY hybrids developed as males, although all XX and the remaining XY hybrids developed as females. Linkage analysis using 236 XY hybrid males obtained from (Hd-rR x HNI) F(1) females showed that a single major locus, Hybrid maleless (Hml), on autosomal linkage group 17, contributed to the strain difference in the XY sex reversal. Furthermore, we found that crossing females of a different O. latipes inbred strain, HO4C, did not cause XY sex reversal in the interspecific hybrids, and that the XY hybrids from (Hd-rR x HO4C) F(1) females showed a 1:1 sex ratio. XY hybrid males had the HO4C allele at sequence-tagged site loci around the Hml locus whereas XY females had the Hd-rR allele, confirming the strong contribution of this locus to XY sex reversal. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis showed a reduced expression of Dmy(curvinotus) in XY fry of the Hd-rR-curvinotus hybrids at hatching. These results suggest that the Hd-rR allele at the Hml locus interfere with the function of Dmy(curvinotus) on a hybrid background, thus resulting in XY sex reversal."

With its high variability and significance in both immune function and olfactory-mediated mate choice, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC/MH) is an ideal system in which to evaluate the relative contributions of these two selective forces to genetic diversity. Intrasexual competition and mate choice are both reversed in sex-role reversed species, and sex-related differences in the detection and use of MH-odor cues are expected to influence the intensity of sexual selection in such species. The seahorse, Hippocampus abdominalis, has an exceptionally highly developed form of male parental care, with female-female competition and male mate choice. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that the sex-role reversed seahorse has a single MH class II beta-chain gene and that the diversity of the seahorse MHIIbeta locus and its pattern of variation are comparable to those detected in species with conventional sex roles. Despite the presence of only a single gene copy, intralocus MHIIbeta allelic diversity in this species exceeds that observed in species with multiple copies of this locus. The MHIIbeta locus of the seahorse exhibits a novel expression domain in the male brood pouch. CONCLUSIONS: The high variation found at the seahorse MHIIbeta gene indicates that sex-role reversed species are capable of maintaining the high MHC diversity typical in most vertebrates.Whether such species have evolved the capacity to use MH-odor cues during mate choice is presently being investigated using mate choice experiments. If this possibility can be rejected, such systems would offer an exceptional opportunity to study the effects of natural selection in isolation, providing powerful comparative models for understanding the relative importance of selective factors in shaping patterns of genetic variation."

Iatipes, 17beta-estradiol (E2) and 17alpha-methyldihydrotestosterone (MDHT) were co-administered by a convenient method for hormonal treatment, in which freshly fertilized eggs were immersed for 24 h in saline containing either or both of the two sex steroids in different concentrations and/or ratios. The minimal concentrations of E2 and MDHT sufficient to induce the maximal rate of sex reversal from male to female and from female to male were 500 ng/ml and 2.5 ng/ml, respectively, both of which were referred to as the most efficacious dose (MED), and each equivalent for the inducing potency in sex reversal. E2 and MDHT, when simultaneously administered at MED, greatly suppressed each other to induce each corresponding sex reversal. Thus, the present experimental results indicate that E2 and DMHT are antagonists that induce corresponding sex reversal, and suggest that genotypic sex in the medaka might be modified through an unknown factor of common affinity to both sex steroids, by which the pathway of differentiation of either sex could be switched at the early stages of development far before gonadal sex differentiation."

Epub 2011 Jan 14.,"Molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in artificially induced ovarian differentiation were analyzed by exposing embryos of medaka (Oryzias latipes) to a potent nonsteroidal estrogen, diethylstilbestrol (DES). Embryos were exposed for short-exposure (SE) [from 0 to 8 d postfertilization (dpf)] and long-exposure (LE) periods (from 0 to 18/28 dpf) to 1 ng/ml of DES, and status of sexual differentiation in somatic and germ cells of these gonads was analyzed at 8, 18, and 28 dpf by histology, cell proliferation assays, TUNEL assay, and in situ hybridization using sex-specific somatic and germ cell markers. Additionally, gonads of exposed fry were examined after withdrawal of DES to see whether effects of DES in exposed fish were reversible or not. DES induced germ cell proliferation and meiosis in XY fry of SE and LE groups. However, SE induced only a partial reduction in expression of gonadal soma-derived factor, the male-dominant somatic cell marker, and was not sufficient to induce ovarian development after withdrawal of DES. On the contrary, LE resulted in complete loss of such male-specific gene expression in somatic cells of XY gonads, and these gonads underwent sustained ovarian development even after withdrawal of DES. Importantly, LE to DES affected germ cell proliferation in XX gonads adversely during early stages of sexual differentiation, leading to reduced gonad weight in adulthood. Interestingly, apoptosis was not the cause for reduction in germ cell number. Taken together, these results indicated that DES exposure has long-lasting effects on the gonadal development in genetic males (sex reversal) and females (reduced gonad weight) of medaka."

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying environmental sex determination. The medaka (Oryzias latipes) is a teleost fish with an XX/XY sex determination system. Recently, it was reported that XX medaka can be sex-reversed into phenotypic males by high water temperature (HT; 32-34 degrees C) treatment during the sex differentiation period. Here we report that cortisol caused female-to-male sex reversal and that metyrapone (an inhibitor of cortisol synthesis) inhibited HT-induced masculinization of XX medaka. HT treatment caused elevation of whole-body levels of cortisol, while metyrapone suppressed the elevation by HT treatment during sexual differentiation. Moreover, cortisol and 33 degrees C treatments inhibited female-type proliferation of germ cells as well as expression of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (fshr) mRNA in XX medaka during sexual differentiation. These results strongly suggest that HT induces masculinization of XX medaka by elevation of cortisol level, which, in turn, causes suppression of germ cell proliferation and of fshr mRNA expression."

Here, we performed genetic analyses of nine spontaneous XX sex-reversed males to elucidate its genetic basis. In all cases, the F(1) progeny were all females, whereas XX males reappeared in the backcross (BC) progeny, suggesting that XX sex reversal is a recessive trait. Although the incidences of sex reversal in the BC progeny were mostly low, 40% were males derived from one XX male. We performed linkage analysis using 55 BC males and located a single major factor, sda-1 (sex-determining autosomal factor-1), controlling sex reversal in an autosomal linkage group. Thus, genes involved in the sex-determining pathway can be isolated from spontaneous mutants in wild populations."

In this study we used HNI inbred strain males of O. latipes for mating with O. curvinotus females, and found that all the XY hybrids developed as males. To map the factor responsible for this strain-specific XY sex reversal, O. curvinotus females were mated with two Y-congenic strains (HNI.Y(Hd-rR) and Hd-rR.Y(HNI)) and a recombinant congenic strain (Hd-rR.Y(HNI)rr). HNI.Y(Hd-rR) produced sex-reversed females in the XY hybrids, whereas no sex-reversed females were obtained in the XY hybrids from Hd-rR.Y(HNI) and Hd-rR.Y(HNI)rr, demonstrating that a small region on the Y chromosome, which includes DMY, is responsible for the XY sex reversal. Sex-reversed hybrids were only produced in the presence of the Y-chromosomal region derived from the Hd-rR strain, suggesting that missense or regulatory mutations specific to the Hd-rR Y-chromosomal region induce the sex reversal."

Epub 2009 Aug 10.,"Medaka is a differentiated gonochoristic species with a male heterogametic sex determination. Here, we review recent studies on gonadal sex differentiation in medaka, as well as the experimental sex-reversal models available for this organism. The accumulated literature on teleost gonadal development facilitates comparative interspecies studies. Among these, comparison between medaka and zebrafish is of special interest, because zebrafish is an undifferentiated gonochorist that, nevertheless, shares many similarities with medaka and is also used as a small fish model for developmental biology. Accordingly, here we focus on the comparative aspects of gonadal development in medaka and zebrafish. In medaka, oogenesis begins in female gonads, whereas oogenesis is suppressed and germ cells remain in an undifferentiated state in male gonads. In zebrafish, oogenesis begins in all individuals, regardless of their future sex, while actual sex differentiation begins later in gonadal development, which means that degeneration of immature oocytes occurs in presumptive males, while oogenesis proceeds to completion in presumptive females. Despite these apparent differences between medaka and zebrafish, the process of gonadal development comprises similar stages: early oogenesis, early aromatase expression, later oocyte development or loss, sexually dimorphic expression of somatic genes, and spermatogenesis. We propose the concept of canalization as a key to gaining a comprehensive understanding of gonadal sex differentiation. In this respect, the possible role of the male-determining gene DMY/dmrt1bY is also discussed."

Since DMY appears to have arisen from a duplicated copy of the autosomal DMRT1 gene approximately 10 million years ago, the medaka Y chromosome is considered to be one of the youngest male-determining chromosomes in vertebrates. In the screening process of sex-reversal mutants from wild populations, we found a population that contained a number of XY females. PCR, direct sequencing, and RT-PCR analyses revealed two different null DMY mutations in this population. One mutation caused loss of expression during the sex-determining period, while the other comprised a large deletion in putative functional domains. YY females with the mutant-type DMY genes on their Y chromosomes were fully fertile, indicating that the X and Y chromosomes were functionally the same except for the male-determining function. In addition, we investigated the frequencies of the sex chromosome types in this population over four successive generations. The Y chromosomes bearing the mutant-type DMY genes were detected every year with no significant differences in their frequencies. These results demonstrate that aberrant Y chromosomes behaving as X chromosomes have been maintained in this population."

Fertilized eggs were exposed from either shortly after fertilization (8-16 cells; embryonic stages 5-6) or from middle embryogenesis (heart development stage; stage 36) until hatching to temperatures ranging from 17 degrees C to 34 degrees C. Secondary sexual characteristics, gonadal histology, progeny testing, sex-linked body coloration and gene expression were used to determine phenotypic and genotypic sex. Sex determination was unaffected by low or high temperatures in genotypic (XY) males. In contrast, genotypic (XX) females treated from stages 5-6 showed increasing rates of sex reversal into phenotypic males at temperatures above 27 degrees C up to 100% at 34 degrees C. Thermal manipulation of sex was ineffective after stage 36, indicating that gonadal fate in medaka is determined considerably earlier than histological differentiation (stage 39). High temperature induced DMRT1 expression in genotypic females, which was observed already from stage 36. Sex-reversed males had histologically normal testes, were capable of sexual courtship and, with the exception of fish from 34 degrees C, sired viable progeny when mating with fertile females. These results clarify the pattern of TSD in medaka and provide important clues to understand the mechanism of sex determination in this species. They also suggest that a brief exposure to high temperature early in life could impair the fertility of medaka as adults."

The resulting germ-cell-deficient medaka show female-to-male sex reversal of their secondary sex characteristics, accompanied by increased levels of androgen and reduced levels of estrogen. A failure to maintain granulosa cells or estrogen-producing cells also occurs at early stages of sex differentiation in the cxcr4 morphants, before the initiation of gonadal morphogenesis. In contrast, androgen-producing cells are unaffected in germ-cell-deficient medaka of either sex. In addition, a single tube-like gonad that expresses male-specific genes is formed in these mutants irrespective of the genetic sex. Significantly, each of these mutant phenotypes occurs in a somatic cell-autonomous manner, suggesting that gonadal somatic cells are predisposed toward male development in the absence of germ cells. This highlights the importance of germ cells in the sexual dimorphism of the gonads."

However, a strictly monogamous pipefish Corythoichthys haematopterus exceptionally exhibits a reversed sex role. To understand why its sex role is reversed, we measured the adult sex ratio and the potential reproductive rate (PRR), two principal factors influencing the operational sex ratio (OSR), in a natural population of southern Japan. The adult sex ratio was biased towards females throughout the breeding season, but the PRR, which increased with water temperature, did not show sexual difference. We found that an alternative index of the OSR (Sf/Sm: sex ratio of 'time in') calculated from the monthly data was consistently biased towards females. The female-biased OSR associated with sex-role reversal has been reported in some polyandrous or promiscuous pipefish, but factors biasing the OSR differed between these pipefish and C. haematopterus. We concluded that the similar PRR between the sexes in C. haematopterus does not confer reproductive benefit of polygamous mating on either sex, resulting in strict monogamous mating, and its female-biased adult sex ratio promotes female-female competition for a mate, resulting in sex-role reversal."

In the intersex and the male,the GSCs are distinguished by two types A and B, both of them differ from the GSCs at the female stage in ultrastructure. It shows that the GSCs existing in the gonadal lamellae are the unique germ family, which owns the capability of mitosis in the differential gonads.

In syngnathid fishes (seahorses and pipefish), males brood offspring in specialized brooding structures. While female-female mating competition has been demonstrated in some pipefishes, all seahorses (genus Hippocampus) studied to date have been found to have conventional sex roles with greater male-male competition for access to mates despite possessing the most complex brood structures in the family. Although multiple mating is common in pipefish, seahorses are again exceptional, exhibiting strict genetic monogamy. Both demographic and behavioural explanations have been offered to explain the lack of multiple mating in seahorse species, but these hypotheses have not yet been explicitly addressed. We investigated mating systems and brood parentage of the pot-bellied seahorse, Hippocampus abdominalis, a temperate-water species that is socially promiscuous with conventional sex roles in laboratory populations. We observed promiscuous courtship behaviour and sex-role reversal in high density, female-biased field populations of H. abdominalis. We hypothesize that sex roles are plastic in H. abdominalis, depending on local population density and sex ratio. Despite promiscuous courtship behaviour, all assayed male seahorses were genetically monogamous in both laboratory and wild populations. Physiological limitations associated with embryo incubation may explain the absence of multiple mating in seahorses and may have played an important role in the development of the unique reproductive behaviour typical in these species."

This mutant manifests a number of remarkable phenotypic abnormalities including: (i) excessive proliferation of germ cells that initiates at around the hatching stage regardless of the genetic sex of the fish; (ii) initiation of premature meiosis in phenotypically male hot homozygotes; (iii) one-half of the hot-homozygous XY fish undergo sex reversal, which accompanies the expression of the female-characteristic aromatase gene in the somatic cells of the gonad; and (iv) in phenotypically female homozygotes, follicular development is arrested at an early stage. We have also performed genetic mapping, chromosome walking, and candidate gene sequencing analysis of hot and demonstrate that the underlying mutation occurs in the recently identified medaka anti-Mullerian hormone (Amh) receptor type II (amhrII) gene. Moreover, this gene was found to be responsible for each of the hot phenotypes, as an amhrII transgene rescues these abnormalities. In addition, the amhrII gene is expressed in the somatic cells of the gonads of both sexes. The phenotypes of the hot homozygotes indicate that there are multiple regulatory functions of the AMH/AMHRII signaling system in the development of the gonad, including the sex-dependent regulation of germ cell proliferation and follicular development. These presumably represent the basic roles of Amh, which precede Mullerian duct evolution during phylogeny."

Different concentration (0.0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15 g L(-1)) of TT was investigated for sex reversal in the Poecilia reticulata. TT extract was administered by immersion of newly born offspring once weekly for two months. Among the dosages used in the present study 0.15 g L(-1) TT was the most effective dosage that ensured maximum male ratio (80%, p < 0.01). Although, sex ratios of 0.05 and 0.1 g L(-1) TT were not significantly different from the expected 1:1 ratio, in these two groups treatment with TT also result in higher number of males (58.25 and 59.77%, respectively), than control (p > 0.05). Total survival rates in all treatments and control were uniformly high ranging from 83 to 87% (p > 0.05). It is concluded that TT has no negative effect on survival rate of P. reticulata. All groups of TT-treated fish exhibited successful growth acceleration comparing to the control group, but only TT treatment at the concentration of 0.15 and 0.1 g L(-1) TT significantly improved growth rate of P. reticulata (p < 0.01). Histological examinations revealed that testes of fish treated with TT-extract contained all stages of spermatogenesis. Sex reversal in P. reticulata demonstrated that TT treated new-born progenies showed successful sex reversal, spermatogenesis and better growth rate than untreated progenies."

Ma-vas encodes a protein of 618 amino acids, which contains all of the known characteristics of vasa homologs. RT-PCR analysis revealed that ma-vas was exclusively expressed in the gonads of the female, intersex, and male. During gonadal natural sex reversal, ma-vas is expressed in oocytes at all stages of oogenesis, in degenerating oocytes of ovotestis, and in spermatogonia and spermatocytes at early stages. The vasa positive signal was also observed in the peripheral layer of late ovary. It was not found, however, in that layer of the testis. Alkaline phosphatase (AKP) staining on the ovary and testis also indicated that some cells had differentiational potential in the peripheral layer of the ovary, suggesting that spermatogonia might arise from cells with AKP and vasa-positive staining in the peripheral layer of the female gonad."

Our findings revealed that the mitotic and meiotic activities of the germ cells in the 0 day after hatching (dah) DMY knock-down XY larvae were identical to those of the normal XX larvae, suggesting the microenvironment of these XY gonads to be similar to that of the normal XX gonad, where DMY is naturally absent. Conversely, E2 treatment failed to initiate mitosis in the XY gonad, possibly due to an active DMY, even though it could initiate meiosis.

In the present study, we obtained interspecific hybrids between O. curvinotus and O. latipes and demonstrated sex-reversed XY females in the hybrids. The incidence of sex-reversed females in F1 XY hybrids between O. curvinotus females and O. latipes males, and hybrids between O. latipes females and O. curvinotus males were 21% and 100%, respectively. These results indicate that DMY does not always determine maleness in hybrid fish even though it is able to specify normal male development on its native genetic background and suggest that there are some differences between DMY(latipes) and DMY(curvinotus) alleles. Appearance of XY females in F1 hybrids also suggests that an autosomal or X-liked gene(s) from the maternal species interferes in the function of the paternal DMY gene in the male-determining process of the hybrid fish. These hybrid fish would supply a new experimental approach for investigating the genetic and molecular pathway of testis determination and differentiation."

Here, we aimed to clarify the cause of this sex reversal. To achieve this, we screened for mutations in the amino acid coding sequence of DMY and examined DMY expression at 0 days after hatching (dah) using densitometric semiquantitative RT-PCR. We found that the mutants could be classified into two groups. One contained mutations in the amino acid coding sequence of DMY, while the other had reduced DMY expression at 0 dah although the DMY coding sequence was normal. For the latter, histological analyses indicated that YwOurYwOur (YwOur, Y chromosome derived from an Oura XY female) individuals with the lowest DMY expression among the tested mutants were expected to develop into females at 0 dah. These results suggest that early testis development requires DMY expression above a threshold level. Mutants with reduced DMY expression may prove valuable for identifying DMY regulatory elements."

In medaka, a male-to-female reversal upon exposure to a xenoestrogen is accompanied by an increase in brain aromatase expression and activity. However, whether this increase is the direct cause of sex reversal is unknown. In this study we further examined the role brain aromatase plays in genesis of developmental abnormalities in response to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Further, the effects of a mixture of apparent antagonistic environmentally relevant EDCs on development were examined to determine if their combined actions could lessen each other's impacts. To this end, hatchling medaka were subjected in a 2-week flow-through immersion exposure to an estrogen mimic [dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (o,p -DDT)] and to pharmaceutical [fadrozole (FAD)] and environmental aromatase inhibitors [tributyltin (TBT)] alone and in combination. Brain aromatase expression and enzyme activity were measured on exposure days 5, 9, and 14 by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and tritiated water release assay, respectively. We recorded sex reversals at sexual maturity by examining the phenotypic and genotypic sex of d-rR-strain medaka. Results indicate that FAD and TBT inhibit aromatase activity in o,p -DDT-treated fish but do not prevent feminization, indicating that increased brain aromatase activity is not critical to EDC-induced male-to-female sex inversion. The observation that estradiol biosynthesis inhibitors do not block the effect of the xenoestrogen suggests that in the environment, exposure to seemingly antagonistic EDCs does not necessarily lessen the harmful impacts of these compounds."

The present finding, that the sex of medakas can be reversed by a single in vitro exposure of immature oocytes to androgen during the preovulatory period, suggests the existence in the oocyte of a sex determinant sensitive to sex steroids. This method for controlling the sex of eggs before fertilization may establish sex-determined eggs as potent material for investigating the mechanism of sex determination in the medaka."

Results of the present experiment showed that the immersion duration in 1 microg/ml E2 to induce 100% reversal of sex differentiation in the genotypic males was enough only for one day (24 hr) post-fertilization (dpf) and that treatment with E2 for 1 dpf resulted in a dose-dependent manner with the maximum sex reversal of 100% at 1 microg/ml. To ascertain early developmental periods efficacious for inducing sex reversal, additional brief immersion treatments of eggs with E2 were further performed individually for four different early developmental periods (Stages 4-9, 10-12, 13-15 and 16-18) within 1 dpf. As a result, induction of sex reversal was observed in all these short immersion periods without any restricted efficacy. Between both experimental and control groups treated with or without E2 for 1 dpf, differences in the number of germ cells in a gonad were compared in newly-hatched fry. It was found that gonads of the genotypic males (XY) treated with E2 revealed the female type which contained many germ cells with much dividing activity. These data suggest that a possible switch mechanism that exogenous E2 could trigger to change the genetic cascades involved in sex determination upon fertilization exists in early developmental stages."

However, previous studies have suggested that high water temperature might affect sex determination in Medaka. In the present study, the influence of high water temperature on sex reversal was examined. Fertilized eggs of two inbred strains of Medaka were developed at high water temperature (32 degrees C) until hatching. The hatched fry were kept at normal water temperatures (27 degrees C) until adulthood, and the phenotypic and genotypic sex was examined. As a result, 24% (N=105) and 50% (N=36) of XX fish developed a male phenotype in the Hd-rR and HNI inbred strains, respectively. These XX sex-reversed males had a normal testis and were fully fertile. On the other hand, all XY fish were male in the both strains. These results demonstrate that high water temperatures can induce XX sex reversal and that elevated water temperatures during the embryonic stage is a simple and useful method for getting XX males in Medaka."

Epub 2005 Aug 30.,"To understand the effect of testosterone on sex differentiation, the quantities of testosterone (T) and estradiol-17beta (E2) in developing eggs of medaka (Oryzias latipes) were measured by radioimmunoassay, and the influence on sex differentiation of treating embryos with exogenous androgens was also examined. Endogenous T of eggs dispersed into the environmental water at spawning, and precipitously declined to a minimum level during incubation for 2 days post-fertilization (dpf). It did not significantly increase during development. The E2 content of fertilized eggs increased when eggs were incubated in medium containing exogenous T at the concentrations of 100 and 500 ng/ml, but not in low concentrations of 10 ng/ml or less. The presence of 500 ng/ml 17alpha-methyltestosterone (MT) in the incubation medium also induced an increase in the E2 content of embryos. Exposure of embryos to exogenous 1 ng/ml T that corresponded with the level of T in eggs shortly after fertilization was enough to induce sex reversal of genotypic females to functional males. The co-existence of T and aromatase inhibitor in incubation medium inhibited not only the T-induced increase in the embryonic E2 content, but also the estrogenic effect of T in causing the paradoxical sex reversal from genotypic males to phenotypic females. However, treatment of embryos with the non-aromatizable androgen, 17alpha-methyldihydrotestosterone, induced no detectable increase in the E2 content of embryos, but still brought about sex reversal of genotypic males into females. This contradictory result suggests that the conversion of androgens to E2 may not always be the cause for induction of paradoxical sex reversal by T treatment. Consequently, these results on sex reversal induced by treatment of embryos with exogenous androgens suggest that endogenous T of developing medaka embryos may not act as the natural andro-inducer, and that genotypic sex can be modified by exogenous sex steroids at early developmental stages long before gonadal differentiation in the medaka."

The present study aimed to examine whether exogenous estrogen (estradiol-17beta; E(2)) affects early sex differentiation, paying particular attention to DMY expression and proliferation activity of germ cells in estrogen treated XY individuals. Our results showed that germ cell number was not affected by E(2) treatment at hatching, and that DMY expression was not suppressed under conditions of sex reversal. Therefore, male differentiation of germ cells, which is triggered by the expression of DMY in the supporting cell lineage, proceeds even in E(2) treated XY individuals until hatching, and early sex differentiation is not altered by estrogen. However, sex reversal occurred after hatching probably because of estrogen remaining in the yolk. Interestingly, DMY expression was also detected in the large follicle layer of E(2 )treated XY ovary. These results suggested that DMY regulates male determination in early embryonic stage but does not suppress female follicle development."

There are two isoforms of aromatase in several teleost species, brain and ovarian. The objective of this study was two-fold: clone and sequence the coding and promoter region of brain aromatase in medaka, and determine the effects of exposure to an environmental estrogen (o,p-DDT) on sex determination and brain aromatase transcription and activity. The brain aromatase coding sequence was obtained by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and PCR-based genomic DNA walking was used to clone the promoter of the brain aromatase gene. The promoter sequence revealed potential binding sites for the estrogen receptor and for transcription factors involved in primary neurogenesis and sex determination. Medaka fry were exposed to increasing o,p-DDT concentrations (0-5.5 microg/L) from days 1 to 15 after hatch and brain aromatase expression and activity were measured on days 5, 9, and 14. A complete male-to-female sex reversal occurred at 5.5 microg/L o,p-DDT and aromatase activity and expression data showed a significant five-fold increase at this concentration at day 14. This information suggests that brain aromatase is involved in the abnormal sexual differentiation of fish treated with xenoestrogens."

Mature eggs were fertilized within the ovarian cavity after a sperm suspension was artificially introduced with a small bore-pipette through the urinogenital opening. Three batches of eggs ovulated within 48 hrs were fertilized and began to develop in the ovarian cavity, while eggs ovulated 72 hrs post-insemination (PI) were no longer fertilized. These observations indicate that ovulation occurs irrespective of the existence of developing embryos within the ovarian cavity. All embryos developing in the ovarian cavity were, however, retarded and ceased development before the stage of initiation of blood circulation at room temperature. These embryos developed normally and hatched after they were transferred from the ovarian cavity into regular saline 48 or 72 hrs PI. When these individuals matured sexually, their sex differentiation was found to be normal, and sex reversal was not observed."

This strain contains the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene fused to the regulatory region of the medaka vasa gene, and germ-cell-specific expression of GFP can be visualized in living (transparent) individuals. The number of germ cells in untreated genotypic females (XX) was approximately 10-fold that in untreated genotypic males (XY) at 10 d posthatch (dph). Germ cell proliferation was prevented in XX females that developed from embryos nanoinjected with 0.5, 2.5, or 5.0 ng of EE2. Some 10-dph XY males from embryos injected with 0.5 ng or more of EE2 showed a larger fluorescent area and more germ cells than those of pooled control groups. Males and females from embryos injected with 5.0 ng of EE2 had no significant difference in germ cell number or fluorescent area. Thus, EE2 injection into embryos caused abnormal gonadal development in both sexes. Observations of external secondary sex characteristics and histological examination of adult gonads showed complete sex reversal in some males after 0.5-, 2.5-, and 5.0-ng treatments but no changes in XX females after any treatment. Thus, quantitative bio-imaging can aid in evaluating the effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals on fish within 10 dph."

The E2 content of eggs precipitously declined to a minimum level by 2 days post-fertilization. The E2 content of eggs was affected by 24 hr of incubation in medium containing exogenous E2 at concentrations above 10 ng/ml. Short (24 hr) exposure of fertilized eggs in the early developmental stage to exogenous E2 at concentrations of 10 ng/ml induced sex reversal of some genotypic males to functional females. However, endogenous E2 levels in fertilized eggs might not influence sexual differentiation in embryogenesis. The present results suggest the possibility that concentrations of exogenous E2 higher than that of endogenous E2 triggers a priming step in the cascade of sex differentiation toward the female, and this effect is maintained."

Epub 2004 Dec 15.,"Alkylphenols including 4-tert-pentylphenol (4-PP) have been shown to alter sexual differentiation in fish due to their estrogenic properties. Medaka (Oryzias latipes) is so sensitive to these substances because morphological sex reversal and testis-ova induction are well developed in the exposed males. However, little work has been done to characterize the molecular effects of estrogenic substances on the morphological and gonadal feminization in male fish. Cytochrome P450 11beta-hydroxylase (P450(11beta)) is a key steroidogenic enzyme in production of 11-ketotestosterone which is the predominant androgen in male fish. In this study, we cloned a cDNA encoding medaka testicular P450(11beta), and then investigated the gene expression of P450(11beta) in the testes of genetically male medaka exposed to 4-PP. The cDNA contains 1740 nucleotides that encode a protein of 543 amino acids, which shares 68.9% and 73.4% homology with testicular P450(11beta)s from Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), respectively. HeLa cells transfected with an expression vector containing the open reading frame of medaka P450(11beta) cDNA showed 11beta-hydroxylating activity in the presence of exogenous testosterone. Analysis of tissue distribution by RT-PCR showed great abundance of P450(11beta) mRNA in testis. In the partial life-cycle exposure with 4-PP, morphologically sex-reversal was observed in XY medaka exposed to 4-PP concentrations of > or =238 microg/L. Furthermore, exposure to 4-PP completely inhibited P450(11beta) mRNA expression in the gonads of sex-reversed XY fish at 60-day posthatch. These results suggest that xeno-estrogen 4-PP may have inhibitory effects on the synthesis of testicular 11-oxygenated androgens through downregulation of P450(11beta) expression in the genetically male fish."

Intersex is often used as an indicator for disruption of sexual differentiation in fish exposed to different kinds of effluents from human activities. In wild fish it has exclusively been reported in terms of feminisation due to xenoestrogens in the environment. The assumption that the intersex individuals are feminised genetic males can only be proven by genetic sex identification of the intersexual individuals. Intersex and gonadal sex reversal were induced in three-spined sticklebacks by treatment with natural and synthetic steroid hormones. Juvenile sticklebacks were exposed to three nominal concentrations of 17 beta-oestradiol (E2); i.e. 0.01, 1.0 and 10.0 microg/L; which were administered to the water either continuously from hatching to the end of the experiment (39-58 days post hatch), during the first 2 weeks after hatching only, from 14 days after hatching onwards, or during the chorionated embryo stage until hatching. Other groups were exposed to 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) at 0.05 microg/L and 17 alpha-methyltestosterone (MT) at 1.0 microg/L (nominal concentrations). MT was applied continuously, during the first 2 weeks post hatch only, or from 14 days after hatching onwards. Gonad histology was examined and the genetic sex was identified with male sex-linked PCR markers. Treatment with oestrogens caused feminisation at the two highest E2 concentrations and with EE2. Exposure to E2 before hatching had no effect. Intersexual individuals from oestrogen treatments were genetic males. The genetic sex marker identified apparent total reversal of the gonad type of genetic males. Treatment with MT did not reveal a clear picture, since intersex was observed in both genetic females and males. MT also caused severe testis abnormalities, mainly the development of large branched cavities with unidentified origin. The process of sex differentiation is most sensitive to the influence of external steroids during the first 2 weeks after hatching. A lower incidence of intersex could also be induced in sticklebacks exposed from 14 days after hatching by E2 treatment, but not with MT. The combination of gonad histopathology with genetic sex identification in juvenile sticklebacks is suggested as a tool for detecting endocrine disruption in laboratory studies, and might become very useful in field surveys."

Primary males develop directly as males while secondary males arise from the sex reversal of females. Fishes from Argentine and Brazil inland waters were collected, examined and compared for this study. In order to characterize the interstitial testicular compartment, light and electron microscopy techniques and an enzyme histochemical examination for steroidogenic cells detection were used. The interstitial compartment of S. marmoratus is composed of Leydig and myoid cells, collagen fibers, blood cells, macrophages,and amyelinic nerves. At the ultrastructural level, no differences were observed in the interstitial tissue, either between specimens from the different sampling sites or between primary and secondary males. Leydig cells are present in all testes examined throughout the year. A cytoplasmatic reaction of 3beta-HSD was detected only in Leydig cells during sex reversal and in both type of males, mainly during the regressed and early maturation classes (autumn and winter). Leydig cells possess the typical fine structural characteristics associated with steroidogenesis. Furthermore, in both type of males, during sex reversal and after the spawning period, the number of granulocytes and macrophages present in the testes increased, suggesting that they could be involved in phagocytosis and resorption of damaged cells."

Mutations in human SOX9 cause campomelic dysplasia, a dominant skeletal dysmorphology syndrome often associated with male to female sex reversal. Here we show that the Sox9a gene was duplicated during evolution of the rice field eel, Monopterus albus, a freshwater fish which undergoes natural sex reversal from female to male during its life, and has a haploid genome size (0.6-0.8 pg) that is among the smallest of the vertebrates. The duplicated copies of the gene (named Sox9al and Sox9a2) fit within the Sox9 clade of vertebrates, especially in the Sox9a subfamily, not in the Sox9b subfamily. They have similar structures as revealed by both genomic and cDNA analysis. Furthermore, both Sox9al and Sox9a2 are expressed in testis, ovary, and ovotestis; and specifically in the outer layer (mainly gonocytes) of gonadal epithelium with bipotential capacity to form testis or ovary, suggesting that they have similar roles in gonadal differentiation during sex reversal in this species. The closely related gene structure and expression patterns of the two sox9a genes in the rice field eel also suggest that they arose in recent gene duplication events during evolution of this fish lineage."

In this fish, the X and Y chromosomes apparently differ only by a 250-kb Y-specific region containing dmrt1bY (also called DMY and dmrt1Y), a male-specific copy of the autosomal gene dmrt1. Dmrt1 is a putative transcription factor probably involved in testis formation in different vertebrate lineages. Dmrt1bY is the only gene having escaped the drastic process of degeneration that devastated the small Y-specific region of the medaka. Mutations leading to truncation or lower expression of dmrt1bY result in XY male-to-female sex reversal. Hence, both genetic and functional evidences converge in making dmrt1bY an outstanding candidate for the function of a master sex-determining gene in fish. Nevertheless, dmrt1bY could not be detected in certain other Oryzias species or in more divergent fishes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the duplication of the autosomal dmrt1 that formed dmrt1bY is young in evolutionary terms. Hence, dmrt1bY is not the universal master sex-determining gene in fish. Because the classical fish models, such as zebrafish and pufferfish, are not very adequate to study the basis of genetic sex determination, alternative models, such as the platyfish (Xiphophorus maculatus), are re-emerging. In this fish, which is a well-suited laboratory organism, gene loci involved in pigmentation, melanoma formation, and sexual maturity have been mapped close to the master sex-determining gene. Interestingly, the platyfish can harbor three different sex chromosomes (W, X, and Y) in certain natural populations. Bacterial artificial chromosome contigs covering the sex-determining region of the platyfish are already available, and the positional cloning of the master sex-determining gene(s) should provide new insights into sex determination and sex chromosome evolution in fish and other vertebrates."

Seahorses and pipefishes (family Syngnathidae) are extraordinary among fishes in their remarkable adaptations for paternal care and frequent occurrences of sex-role reversals (i.e., female-female competition for mates), offering exceptional opportunities to test predictions of sexual selection theory. During mating, the female transfers eggs into or onto specialized egg-brooding structures that are located on either the male's abdomen or its tail, where they are osmoregulated, aerated, and nourished by specially adapted structures. All syngnathid males exhibit this form of parental care but the brooding structures vary, ranging from the simple ventral gluing areas of some pipefishes to the completely enclosed pouches found in seahorses. We present a molecular phylogeny that indicates that the diversification of pouch types is positively correlated with the major evolutionary radiation of the group, suggesting that this extreme development and diversification of paternal care may have been an important evolutionary innovation of the Syngnathidae. Based on recent studies that show that the complexity of brooding structures reflects the degree of paternal investment in several syngnathid species, we predicted sex-role reversals to be more common among species with more complex brooding structures. In contrast to this prediction, however, both parsimony- and likelihood-based reconstructions of the evolution of sex-role reversal in pipefishes and seahorses suggest multiple shifts in sex roles in the group, independent from the degree of brood pouch development. At the same time, our data demonstrate that sex-role reversal is positively associated with polygamous mating patterns, whereas most nonreversed species mate monogamously, suggesting that selection for polygamy or monogamy in pipefishes and seahorses may strongly influence sex roles in the wild."

To clarify the mechanism by which exogenous estrogens caused these developmental effects, we determined the sequence of an estrogen receptor (ER) coding region, encoded by 620 amino acid residues. This region shared 80% identity to that of ER alpha of medaka (Oryzias latipes). Northern blot analysis showed that two ER alpha mRNAs with 5.5 and 4 kb were expressed in the liver. These mRNAs were strongly induced by E(2) stimulation. The 4 kb mRNA was expressed 8 h after treatment, whereas the 5.5 kb mRNA was not induced until 12 h after E(2) stimulation. Vitellogenin (VTG) was expressed 8 h after E(2) stimulation in the male liver. Receptor binding assays using the protein of F. heteroclitus ER alpha (fh ER alpha) ligand binding domain showed that alkylphenols bind to fh ER alpha with a higher affinity (50 times or more) as compared with the human ER alpha. The present results demonstrate that the fh ER alpha has a sequence very similar to that of medaka, and the mRNA for this receptor was induced by E(2)-stimulation, followed subsequently by VTG expression. Furthermore, alkylphenols bind to fh ER alpha more efficiently than to human ER alpha."

During sex reversal, the ovarian germinal epithelium, which forms follicles containing an oocyte and encompassing follicle cells during the female portion of the life cycle, produces numerous invaginations, or acini, into the ovarian stroma. Within the acini, the gonia that formerly produced oocytes become spermatogonia, enter meiosis, and produce sperm. The acini are bounded by the basement membrane of the germinal epithelium. Epithelial cells of the female germinal epithelium, which formerly became follicle (granulosa) cells, now become Sertoli cells in the developing testis. Subsequently, lobules and testicular ducts form. The swamp eel testis has a lobular germinal compartment in both primary and secondary males, although the germinal compartment in testes of secondary males resides within the former ovarian lamellae. The germinal compartment, supported by a basement membrane, is composed of Sertoli and germ cells that give rise to sperm. Histological and immunohistochemical techniques were used to describe the five reproductive classes that were observed to occur during the annual reproductive cycle: regressed, early maturation, mid-maturation, late maturation, and regression. These classes are differentiated by the presence of continuous or discontinuous germinal epithelia and by the types of germ cells present. Synbranchus marmoratus has a permanent germinal epithelium. Differences between the germinal compartment of the testes of primary and secondary males were not observed."

These monosex populations had the predicted chromosomal constitution as shown by a sex chromosome-specific DNA sequence. However, in XX populations the spontaneous development of males without previous exposure to androgens was observed. Differences in the percentage of male offspring from individual XX breeding pairs indicate a possible variation of unknown genetic factors to be responsible for the development of XX males. The expression of two gonadal genes that are involved in sex differentiation, Dmrt1b(Y) and Fig1a (factor in the germ line alpha), was analyzed in monosex populations. Dmrt1b(Y) expression correlated strictly with the genotype but not the sexual phenotype. When XY juvenile fish were exposed to 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol at concentrations that induce sex reversal, Dmrt1b(Y) expression was not repressed. However, Dmrt1b(Y) was expressed in XY or YY gonads regardless of the sex and could not be detected in XX individuals. In contrast, the expression of Fig1a correlated with the phenotypic sex: Fig1a was expressed in male juvenile fish exposed to 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol and repressed in fish exposed to 17 alpha-methyltestosterone. The Dmrt1b(Y) expression appears to reflect an early and important event in sex determination and lends support to the suggested key regulatory role of the Dmrt1b(Y) gene in sex determination. This process is apparently hormone insensitive, and the expression of further downstream acting genes can be regulated (directly or indirectly) by sex steroids."

Ovarian anatomy, stages of oocyte development and micropyle structure.","Aldo Ravaglia M, Maggese MC",Biocell. 2002 Dec;26(3):325-37.,"Synbranchus marmoratus (Synbranchidae), commonly known as the swamp eel, is a protogynous diandric teleost fish widely distributed throughout South America. The purpose of this work was to study the ovarian anatomy and to describe oocyte developmental stages in the swamp eel, Synbranchus marmoratus. S. marmoratus has a unique sacular ovary. It is covered by a conspicuous muscular wall, probably involved in an egg-releasing system acting as a peristaltic-like mechanism. The internal ovarian anatomy shows a U-shaped ovarian lamella delimiting a dorsal ovarian lumen. The microscopic study shows evidence of the existence of a germinal epithelium in the inner surface of the lamella, which contains germinal cells, pre-follicular cells and epithelial cells. The complete oogenesis process is divided into four stages: oogonia, primary growth, cortical alveoli and vitellogenesis. Besides, the ovulated oocytes, and atretic structures were described. The structure of the micropyle was studied by scanning electron microscopy (MEB). Near the animal pole the vitelline envelope forms crests that fuse together becoming furrow-like structures with a slightly spiraled direction that converge into the micropyle pit where is located the micropylar canal. Although the sex reversal process of Synbranchids has been subject of many studies, this is the first complete description of the ovarian anatomy and oogenesis."

The transgenic fish underwent the genetically determined gonadal differentiation and showed the same sex-reversal rates as those of wild-type non-transgenic fish after treatments with estrogen and androgen. These results present invaluable data to reconsider the role of estrogen receptor in the gonadal sex determination."

Like o,p -DDT, o,p -DDE is estrogenic and is believed to exert its effects through binding to the estrogen receptor. The limited toxicologic data for o,p -DDE suggest that it decreases fecundity and fertility of fishes. We conducted an egg injection study using the d-rR strain of medaka and environmentally relevant concentrations of o,p -DDE to examine its effects on sexual differentiation and development. The gonads of exposed fish showed no evidence of sex reversal or intersex. However, other gonad abnormalities occurred in exposed individuals. Females exhibited few vitellogenic oocytes and increased atresia. Male testes appeared morphologically normal but were very small. Gonadosomatic index values for both sexes were lower for exposed fish. Our observations of abnormal female and very small male gonads after in ovo o,p -DDE exposure may be indicative of effects on early endocrine processes important for normal ovarian and testicular development."

In order to establish a model system to study the effects of such environmental chemicals on aquatic animals, we examined the effects of a natural estrogen, 17 beta-estradiol (E(2)), on early development of Fundulus heteroclitus. Embryos of F. heteroclitus were reared in seawater containing 10(-10), 10(-8), and 10(-6) M E(2) throughout the experiment. Hatching and survival rates decreased in a dose-dependent manner, and fry treated with 10(-6) M E(2) and 10(-8) M E(2) were dead by two weeks and 12 weeks after hatching, respectively. More than 85% of fry treated with 10(-8) M E(2) showed malformations: i.e., eye extrusion, crooked vertebral column, faded lateral-stripe pattern eight weeks after hatching. Body weight and head and body lengths were significantly reduced in E(2)-treated fry when compared to controls. Ossification was not completed in vertebrae, cranial bones, and other bones in fry treated with 10(-8) M E(2) even 12 weeks after hatching. Sex ratio of control fry was 57% male and 43% female, whereas fry treated with 10(-8) M E(2) were 100% female eight weeks after hatching. The present results demonstrate that exogenous estrogen induced death of embryos and fry, malformations, sex reversal, and incomplete ossification of vertebrae and cranial bones, which would result in shorter body and head lengths and in malformed vertebrae leading to a hunchback condition."
12216983,"Sex reversal of genetic females (XX) induced by the transplantation of XY somatic cells in the medaka, Oryzias latipes.","Shinomiya A, Shibata N, Sakaizumi M, Hamaguchi S",Int J Dev Biol. 2002 Aug;46(5):711-7.,"In order to investigate the function of gonadal somatic cells in the sex differentiation of germ cells, we produced chimera fish containing both male (XY) and female (XX) cells by means of cell transplantation between blastula embryos in the medaka, Oryzias latipes. Sexually mature chimera fish were obtained from all combinations of recipient and donor genotypes. Most chimeras developed according to the genetic sex of the recipients, whose cells are thought to be dominant in the gonads of chimeras. However, among XX/XY (recipient/donor) chimeras, we obtained three males that differentiated into the donor's sex. Genotyping of their progeny and of strain-specific DNA fragments in their testes showed that, although two of them produced progeny from only XX spermatogenic cells, their testes all contained XY cells. That is, in the two XX/XY chimeras, germ cells consisted of XX cells but testicular somatic cells contained both XX and XY cells, suggesting that the XY somatic cells induced sex reversal of the XX germ cells and the XX somatic cells. The histological examination of developing gonads of XX/XY chimera fry showed that XY donor cells affect the early sex differentiation of germ cells. These results suggest that XY somatic cells start to differentiate into male cells depending on their sex chromosome composition, and that, in the environment produced by XY somatic cells in the medaka, germ cells differentiate into male cells regardless of their sex chromosome composition."

Mutations in human SOX9 gene cause skeletal defects and male-to-female sex reversal, indicating its essential roles in chondrogenesis and testis development. Comparative studies have shown that Sox9 is expressed in chondrogenic tissues and testis in other vertebrates. Therefore, it was suggested that roles of Sox9 in cartilage and male gonad development are conserved among vertebrates. To investigate the evolutional significance of Sox9 in the gonad and cartilage development of teleost fish, we isolated medaka sox9 and analyzed its expression. Two kinds of transcripts (sox9 and sox9lf) were isolated by cDNA library screening. The sox9 encoded 487 amino acids and showed approximately 70% amino acid identity with known vertebrate SOX9 proteins. The sox9lf was a longer form of the sox9, which was transcribed from an additional exon in the 5' upstream region. Interestingly, the expression of medaka sox9 was predominantly observed in the adult ovary by northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses, whereas in the testis, its expression was detectable only by RT-PCR. During medaka embryogenesis, its expression was observed in the cranial cartilage and pectoral fin endoskeleton. These observations suggest that the function of Sox9 in the cartilage is conserved among vertebrates, while that in the gonad is quite different in medaka."

Exposure to > or =2 microg/L octylphenol caused a 20-30% increase in mortality both before and after hatch. Growth was significantly decreased in fish exposed to 50 microg/L octylphenol and in the positive control. Sex ratio changed from 42:58 (females:males) in controls to 57:40 at 50 microg/L octylphenol, and 3 and 4% of the medaka exposed to 50 microg/L octylphenol and 17beta-estradiol developed testes-ova. In cross-mating experiments, mating of exposed males with control females resulted in an up to 11% lower fertilization rate than in controls. Results indicate that continuous exposure to octylphenol causes a broad variety of reproductive effects, which can be correlated with the xenoestrogenic potential of octylphenol."

However, more recent work has called into question the idea that all species with male pregnancy are sex-role reversed with respect to the intensity of sexual selection. Furthermore, no studies have formally quantified the opportunity for sexual selection in any natural breeding assemblage of pipefishes or seahorses in order to demonstrate conclusively that sexual selection acts most strongly on females. Here, we use a DNA-based study of parentage in the Gulf pipefish Syngnathus scovelli in order to show that sexual selection indeed acts more strongly on females than on males in this species. Moreover, the Gulf pipefish exhibits classical polyandry with the greatest asymmetry in reproductive roles (as quantified by variances in mating success) between males and females yet documented in any system. Thus, the intensity of sexual selection on females in pipefish rivals that of any other taxon yet studied."

They are identified by a DNA-binding homology motif, the DM domain, and constitute a gene family (DMRTs). Unlike the invertebrate genes, whose role in the sex-determination process is essentially understood, the function of the different vertebrate DMRT genes is not as clear. Evidence has accumulated for the involvement of DMRT1 in male sex determination and differentiation. DMRT2 (known as terra in zebrafish) seems to be a critical factor for somitogenesis. To contribute to a better understanding of the function of this important gene family, we have analyzed DMRT1, DMRT2, and DMRT3 from the genome model organism Fugu rubripes and the medakafish, a complementary model organism for genetics and functional studies. We found conservation of synteny of human chromosome 9 in F. rubripes and an identical gene cluster organization of the DMRTs in both fish. Although expression analysis and gene linkage mapping in medaka exclude a function for any of the three genes in the primary step of male sex determination, comparison of F. rubripes and human sequences uncovered three putative regulatory regions that might have a role in more downstream events of sex determination and human XY sex reversal."

Embryos were injected with graded doses of methyl testosterone (MT) prior to epiboly. The occurrence of sex-reversal, and the gonadosomatic index (GSI) were evaluated in adults. Primary germ cells were counted and gonad volumes calculated for larvae to determine if sex-reversal could be detected at an early life stage. Sex-reversal of genetic females to phenotypic males was observed at both life stages. The GSI for phenotypic females was greater than for phenotypic males, while the GSI in XX males was similar to XY males. MT appeared to reduce the GSI of XX females exposed to MT but not sex-reversed. Our results indicate that embryonic exposure to androgens influences sexual development in medaka. Utilizing the d-rR strain of medaka allows detection of an effect as early as 2 weeks after chemical exposure making this a useful tool to screen chemicals for effects on sexual differentiation."

A variety of environmental chemicals are also active at sex steroid receptors and theoretically possess the potential to alter normal sexual differentiation in fish. However, in controlled environmental chemical exposures to date, only partial alterations of fish sexual phenotype have been observed. Here we report complete, permanent, and functional male-to-female sex reversal in the Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes, d-rR strain) after a onetime embryonic exposure to the xenoestrogen o, p'-DDT. d-rR strain medaka are strict gonochorists that possesses both sex-linked pigmentation, which distinguishes genotypic sex, and sexually dimorphic external secondary sexual characteristics, which distinguish phenotypic sex. We directly microinjected the xenoestrogen o, p'-DDT into the egg yolks of medaka at fertilization to parallel the maternal transfer of lipophilic contaminants to the embryo. At 10 weeks of age, microinjected medaka were examined for mortality and sex reversal. A calculated embryonic dose of 511 +/- 22 ng/egg o, p'-DDT (mean +/- standard error) resulted in 50% mortality. An embryonic exposure of 227 +/- 22 ng/egg o, p'-DDT resulted in 86% (6 of 7) sex reversal of genetic males to a female phenotype (XY females). XY females were distinguished by sex-linked male pigmentation accompanying female secondary sexual characteristics. Histologic examination of the gonads confirmed active ovaries in 100% of the XY females. In 10-day breeding trials in which XY females were paired with normal XY males, 50% of the XY females produced fertilized embryos; this represents a comparable breeding success rate to normal XX females. Fertilized eggs produced from XY females hatched to viable larvae. These results clearly indicate that a weakly estrogenic pesticide, o, p'-DDT, when presented during the critical period of gonadal development, can profoundly alter sexual differentiation."

In the postspawning stage, oLH induced precocious sex reversal in the gonad from female to male and increased plasma levels of Ad, T, KT and OHT. However, such oLH effects in M. albus females were slight at the early prespawning stage, and no significant signs of precocious sex reversal were found either in gonadal structure or in plasma hormones as those in postspawning treatment. After LHRH-A treatment of M. albus females in both postspawning and early prespawning stages, the gonadal structure remained ""female type"" with no sign of proliferation of either Leydig cells or male germ cells. The plasma levels of E2 were greatly increased after the treatment."

At the postspawning stage, oLH induced a precocious sex reversal with marked proliferation of interstitial Leydig cells and development of spermatogonial cysts in the gonads, and enhanced in vitro production of unsaturated androgens. However, such oLH effects were insignificant in females during the early prespawning stage: some spermatogonial cysts appeared, but no proliferation of Leydig cells took place. During both the postspawning and early prespawning stages, LHRH-A stimulated growth of the oocytes with increased yolk content. Gonadal steroid metabolism by females at early prespawning stage was not affected by LHRH-A within the brief experimental period. In the postspawning period, LHRH-A caused a change in the in vitro steroidogenic profile from a postspawning pattern to that of a typical prespawning female pattern with increased production of estrogens and two unknown metabolites, and decreased production of 5 alpha-androstan-3 beta-OH-17-one."

In the males, 11-oxotestosterone was the major product during the prespawning, reproductively active period, while in other periods of the seasonal cycle, 5 alpha-reduced metabolites were more abundant.

Ultrastructural features related to steroidogenesis have been identified in the interstitial Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, granulosa cells and thecal cells, and are especially abundant in the Leydig cells during the mid-intersexual phase. Steroidogenic ultrastructures in the Sertoli cells develop only during the maturation of the spermatogenic cysts, whereas in the granulosa and thecal cells, these features become obvious only during the maturation of the large oocytes. EM evidence also suggests a nutritive function for the Sertoli cells and the granulosa cells. Results of in vitro steroidogenic studies, using either testosterone or progesterone as a precursor, show a predominant conversion to androstenedione and 5 alpha-reduced compounds, and suggest a change in biosynthesis from 5 alpha-reduced products to androstenedione during sex reversal. 11-Ketotestosterone (11KT) has been identified, but not 11 beta-hydroxytestosterone. Production of 11KT is high in the late intersexual and the male phases, but a lack of a marked variation in 11KT production between the early and the mid-intersexual phase suggests that this steroid is not a trigger for natural sex reversal in Monopterus."
