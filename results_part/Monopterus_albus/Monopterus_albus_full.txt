Same-aged swamp eels from the same parents, kept under the same conditions in terms of environment, diet, etc., were used as the study materials. After breeding for 1 year, 18 healthy swamp eels (nine males and nine females), weighing 39.4 ± 2.3 g, were selected. The intestinal contents of three swamp eels of the same sex were combined and labeled as follows: FM1-FM3 (n = 3) for females and MM1-MM3 (n = 3) for males. High-throughput sequencing was used to research the v3-v4 region of 16S rDNA in the intestinal flora. The results suggested significant differences in the structure, composition, and diversity of the intestinal flora of male versus female swamp eels. The relative abundances of Actinobacteria and Spirochaetes in female swamp eels were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in male swamp eels at the phylum level. The relative abundances of Mycobacterium, Bacillus, and Vagococcus in female swamp eels were considerably higher (p < 0.05) than in male swamp eels at the genus level. The Alpha diversity of females was higher than that of males, and the Shannon index of females was also significantly higher (p < 0.05, Tukey’s HSD) than that in males. Investigations of Beta diversity, including NMDS ordination, UPGMA cluster analysis, and PLS-DA analysis, showed that female and male swamp eels could be clearly distinguished based on significant differences in intestinal flora between the FM group and the MM group. LEfSe analysis showed that the dominant bacteria were Cetobacterium in male swamp eels and Clostridium_sp_ND2, Mycobacterium, Alphaproteobacteria, and Bacilli in female swamp eels. The results showed dramatic differences in the intestinal flora between the sexes, which indicates the need for a more in-depth study on sex reversal in the future.The swamp eel (Monopterus albus) is rich in nutrition, has very palatable meat, and is favored by consumers. It is a major freshwater economic fish in China (Chi et al., 2017). It has the characteristic of undergoing a sex reversal: during the embryonic stage and to the first sexual maturity, it is female; it then enters an intersex state, and then some individuals develop into males (Zhao et al., 2018). The number of wild swamp eels is steadily decreasing with increasing demand in domestic and foreign markets. Large-scale artificial breeding has become an inevitable trend. However, because swamp eel is initially female and then transforms into a male, the size of the female swamp eel is small, and the number of eggs is low. This limits the large-scale production of swamp eels. If the sex reversal of swamp eels can be regulated, it may provide an effective way to facilitate their large-scale breeding. Thus, numerous studies have been conducted from the perspective of genes and epigenetics, which have shown some promising results (Zhou et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2003). However, the sex reversal of swamp eel has not been reported from the perspective of intestinal flora.The intestinal flora is considered an integral part of the organism (Bi et al., 2015). Also, the intestinal flora has been regarded as a large and complex ecosystem in the body, which is affected by diet, physiological status, environmental factors, genetic factors, and other factors (Filippo et al., 2010; O’Toole, 2012; Zijlmans et al., 2015; Karl et al., 2017). The intestinal flora of fish is also affected by many factors, including diet, developmental stage, environmental temperature, and growth rate (Maiwore et al., 2009; Campbell and Buswell, 2010; Ringø et al., 2016; Neuman et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2019). However, the impact of sex on intestinal flora is unclear. Studies have shown that the feeding habits of Boleophthalmus pectinirostris and Periophthalmus magnuspinnatus have more significant effects on the intestinal flora than sex (Ma et al., 2018). However, under the same feeding habits, significant differences were found in the intestinal flora of males versus females (Ma et al., 2018). A significant correlation between sex and intestinal flora in Gasterosteus aculeatus and Perca fluviatilis was also reported (Bolnick et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2018). These studies suggested that intestinal flora might be significantly associated with sex in fish.This study elucidates the basic composition of intestinal flora in swamp eels and identifies the key bacteria in male versus female swamp eels to provide useful information for the study of the sex reversal mechanism in male and female swamp eels.With the approval of the animal care and use committee of Jiangxi Agricultural University, the study was conducted out in the aquaculture base of Jiangxi Agricultural University (28°45′N,115°49′E), Jiangxi, China. At the start of the experiment, the swamp eels were cultured from eggs to 4 months of age, and 162 fry of the same size and strong physique, with an average body weight of 5.70 ± 0.05 g, were screened from all the fry in the study. The swamp eels were put into a cage (1.0 × 2.0 × 1.0 m), and the cage was placed in a 3.5 × 1.2 × 1.2 m cement pool. To simulate the actual culture environment, 95% freshwater hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) was placed in the cage. The bottom of the pool had the shape of a pot bottom. A drainage hole with a diameter of 110 mm was made in the lowest part of the pool. A water inlet hole with a diameter of 30 mm was made in the upper part of the pool. The inlet was controlled by a valve to adjust the volume of water flow. Through air lift by a fan, the flow of water could be promoted and the amount of oxygen could be increased. The temperature of the aquaculture water was 25–28°C, the pH value was 7.2–8.0, and the dissolved oxygen was >5 mg/L. The experimental diets are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Fish were fed with the same experimental feed twice a day (08:00 and 18:00). Eighteen swamp eels (nine males and nine females) of the same size and strong physique, with an average body weight of 39.4 ± 2.3 g, were selected from 162 swamp eels and cultured for 8 months. Swamp eels were transported to the laboratory over ice and anesthetized with 60 mg/l–1 doses of MS-222 for 10 min. The fish body surface was then swabbed with 75% ethanol two to three times. After sterile dissection, the intestinal contents were taken into a sterile microcentrifuge tube, put into liquid nitrogen for quick freezing, and transferred to an ultra-low-temperature refrigerator at −80°C for preservation. Each intestinal content replicate was pooled from three sampled fish (same gender) and labeled as follows: FM1-FM3 (n = 3) for female swamp eels and MM1-MM3 (n = 3) for male swamp eels.Intestinal microbial DNA was extracted by the DNA extraction kit of Tiangen Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing). The DNA samples that passed the quality test were sent to Major Bio-Technology Co., Ltd., for amplification and sequencing. After the v3-v4 region of 16S rDNA was amplified by fusing primers with 338F and 806R barcodes, an Illumina MiSeq platform was used for high-throughput sequencing (Han et al., 2019). According to barcode and primer sequence, all raw data were screened by using Quantitative Insight into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) (Zheng et al., 2017; Han et al., 2019).Some of the raw data obtained by sequence were useless data. To make the results of information analysis more accurate, the raw data were spliced and filtered to obtain effective data (Bokulich et al., 2013; Xing et al., 2019). Based on valid data, the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered by USEARCH (version 7.0)1 with 97% identity as the division standard (Han et al., 2019). The representative sequence in each OTU was screened and used to annotate taxonomic information using the Silva Database2 based on the Mothur algorithm. Alpha diversity statistics for each sample were calculated by Mothur (version 1.30.1), including the observed richness (Sobs), the Simpson diversity index, the Shannon diversity index, the Chao1 richness estimator, the ACE estimator, the phylogenetic diversity (PD), and Good’s coverage. Beta diversity assessment included non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS), a cluster analysis diagram based on the Unweighted Pair-group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA), and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). NMDS ordination can observe the degree of difference between samples based on the Binary_Euclidean distance of OTUs. Bacterial taxonomic differences between the FM group and the MM group at the genus or other taxonomic level were analyzed using LEfSe. SPSS 22.0 was used to perform statistical analysis. The sequence information for this study has been uploaded to GenBank with the accession number SRP230335.In total, 266441 good quality V3-V4 regions of 16S rDNA sequences were detected from the six samples. Each sample was resampled to the minimum number of sample sequences (39549 reads per sample) and clustered, resulting in 407 OTUs of 97% identity, with the number of OTUs in each sample ranging from 67 to 310. In order to evaluate the depth of sequencing and species richness, a rarefaction curve was constructed for each sample. The rarefaction curves (Supplementary Figure S1) showed that most of the OTUs in all samples were detected and that all samples reached saturation. At the same time, the Good’s coverage indices of all samples were as high as 99%, indicating that the depth of sequencing was sufficient (Table 1). The Alpha diversity of intestinal flora was calculated by the Sobs, Chao1, ACE, PD-whole-tree, Shannon, and Simpson diversity indices. The specific results on Alpha diversity are shown in Table 1. The Alpha diversity of females was higher than that of males, and the Shannon index of females was also significantly higher (p < 0.05, Tukey’s HSD) than that in males. The results suggested that sex had a positive influence on the species diversity of intestinal flora in swamp eels.Table 1. Differences in intestinal microbial alpha diversity in swamp eels of different sex.A total of 407 OTUs was obtained in all samples, of which 136 OTUs were shared between the female and male swamp eel samples. The numbers of unique OTUs in the female and male swamp eel samples were 235 and 36, respectively (Figure 1). According to the results of compositional analysis, a total of 12 different phyla was identified in all samples. After merging areas constituting less than 1%, all samples were found to be concentrated in five phyla (Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and cyanobacteria) (Figure 2A). In the FM group, the dominant phyla were Firmicutes (84.23%), Actinobacteria (8.46%), and Proteobacteria (5.49%). In the MM group, the dominant phyla were Firmicutes (73.43%) and Fusobacteria (22.55%). From the relationship between the sample and the species (Supplementary Figure S2), the Firmicutes phylum was distributed in the two groups, and the distribution ratio (FM:53%, MM:47%) was similar. Actinobacteria (97%) and Proteobacteria (78%) were mainly distributed in the FM group, while Fusobacteria (98%) were mainly distributed in the MM group. These results suggest that the predominant phylum of the two groups was the same but that the other dominant phylum was different. Next, we analyzed the comparative composition of intestinal flora in the two groups at the genus level. After merging areas constituting less than 1%, all samples were found to be concentrated in eight generaFigure 1. Venn diagram of OTUs in the female and the male swamp eels. The numbers of shared and unique OTUs are displayed.Figure 2. The intestinal bacterial communities at the phylum level (A) and the genus level (B).(Figure 2B). In the FM group, the dominant genera were Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 (70.11%), Candidatus_Arthromitus (8.35%), Mycobacterium (7.33%), norank_f_MNG7 (2.82%), and Bacillus (1.22%). In the MM group, the dominant genera were Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 (61.12%), Cetobacterium (22.55%), unclassified_f_Peptostreptococcaceae (11.37%), and norank_c_Cyanobacteria (2.07%).Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis ordination based on the OTU abundance of each swamp eel sample was used to show the relationship between the FM group and the MM group more clearly. The NMDS ordination results showed that the three male samples were very close to each other and could be separated from the three female samples, which indicated significant differences in community structure between male and female swamp eels (Figure 3). Meanwhile, the cluster analysis diagram based on UPGMA showed similar results, wherein samples of FM1, FM2, and FM3 were clustered into one branch, while samples of MM1, MM2, and MM3 were clustered into another, which illustrated that the difference between samples was mainly due to sex (Figure 4). The PLS-DA analysis results showed that the female and male samples could be distinguished and grouped into two groups, indicating that the intestinal flora compositions of female and male eels were significantly different. Besides, the dispersion of the sample point distribution in PLS-DA analysis showed major variations in the composition of the intestinal flora of different female samples (Supplementary Figure S3).Figure 3. NMDS ordination based on Binary_euclidean similarities of bacterial communities. The blue triangles represent female swamp eels (FM), and the red circles represent male swamp eels (MM).Figure 4. Clustering tree constructed by UPGMA (FM, female swamp eel; MM, male swamp eel).Analysis of the differences between the two groups showed a significant difference (p < 0.05) in Actinobacteria and Saccharibacteria between the FM group and MM group, but there was no significant difference in other phyla (p > 0.05) (Supplementary Figure S4). At the genus level, the relative abundances of Mycobacterium, Bacillus, and Vagococcus in the FM group were significantly higher than those in the MM group (p < 0.05) (Supplementary Figure S5). At the species level (>1%), Candidatus_Arthromitus only existed in the FM group, while Porphyromonadaceae, Halanaerobium, Lachnospiraceae_bacterium_mt14, Dechlo romonas, Lysobacter_ximonensis, Chryseobacterium, Aeromonas_sharmana, Duganella, and Nitrospira only existed in the MM group (Supplementary Figures S6, S7). As shown in Figure 1, the FM group had more species than the MM group. To more accurately identify biomarkers between the two groups, LEfSe analysis was used to identify the key roles with significant effects in the FM group and the MM group. The threshold for the LDA score was set to 4.0. The LEfSe cladogram (Figure 5A) showed that Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria were divided between the MM and FM groups: Actinobacteria in the FM group, and Fusobacteria in the MM group. In contrast to female swamp eels, the genus Cetobacterium (LDA score = 5.100, P = 0.049) and the phylum Fusobacteria (LDA score = 4.066, p = 0.024) were predominant in the intestinal flora of the male eel. Meanwhile, the species Clostridium_sp_ND2 (LDA score = 5.096, p = 0.049), the genus Mycobacterium (LDA score = 5.220, p = 0.049), the class Alphaproteobacteria (LDA score = 4.444, p = 0.049), and bacilli (LDA score = 4.226, p = 0.049) were predominant in female swamp eels (Figure 5B). When the threshold was adjusted to 2.0, numerous differential dominant species appeared in females but not in males (Supplementary Figure S8).Figure 5. LEfSe map of species differences between the FM group and MM group at the species level. (A) LEfSe cladogram, (B) highly significant bacteria with LDA score >4.In the early stage of fish growth and development, the intestinal flora mainly comes from diet, the surrounding water, and the soil environment, and it changes dynamically with the growth and development of fish, Li et al. (2014), Stephens et al. (2016), and Ma et al. (2018). Some studies have pointed out that different sexes of fish display different physiological characteristics and behaviors during reproduction (Liao et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2018). The differences in intestinal flora between male and female swamp eels have not been studied. Factors such as diet, host genetic background, and age can influence intestinal flora in the same host with different sex (Org et al., 2016). Hence, the swamp eels in this experiment were fed the same experimental diet and kept in the same aquatic environment to ensure that the conditions were the same for all eels. Sex was considered as the only influencing factor when determining the intestinal flora of swamp eels of different sex by high-throughput sequencing. The differences in intestinal flora of swamp eels of different sex were analyzed and compared. The Shannon index in the female swamp eels was higher (p < 0.05) than that in males. There was no significant difference in other Alpha diversity indexes, but the diversity and richness of the female swamp eels were higher than in the males. The Alpha diversity of males was higher than that of females in zebrafish and B. pectinirostris (Liu et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2018), which was contrary to the results of this study. This may be caused by species differences or the unique sex reversal in swamp eels, which accounts for the diversity of intestinal flora in swamp eels compared to common fish. There are few relevant studies and insufficient information, so the specific mechanism requires further study. Meanwhile, the Beta diversity analysis found significant differences in intestinal microflora between female and male swamp eels. The distribution of the male sample was clustered, while the female sample was scattered. This indicates that the female has higher specificity in the intestinal flora, suggesting that the intestinal flora of swamp eels changes at different developmental stages.The intestinal flora in swamp eel was previously reported to be mainly Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, and Proteobacteria (Peng et al., 2019), which was similar to the results of this study. Analysis of the composition of intestinal flora in female versus male swamp eels showed that Actinobacteria content was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in females than in males at the phylum level. Fusobacteria were more abundant in males than in females. Studies in zebrafish and B. pectinirostris showed that the abundance of Fusobacteria in males was lower than that in females (Liu et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2018), which was contrary to the results of this study. However, studies on mice showed that the abundance of Actinobacteria in females was higher than that in females (Org et al., 2016), which was consistent with this study. At the phylum level, the results of very distant host species (swamp eel and mice) are similar, while the results of closer host species (swamp eel, zebrafish, and B. pectinirostris) are the opposite, for unknown reasons. The sex reversal of swamp eel could perhaps lead to the diversity of intestinal microbes, which differed from that of regular fish. This hypothesis remains to be tested. There are several differences in physiological structure and lifestyle between swamp eels and mice. We further compared them at the genus and the species levels, which showed substantial differences. Therefore, although the two are similar at the phylum level, the microorganisms that can survive and colonize their intestines are very different. This study found that the higher abundance of Fusobacteria in male swamp eels was due to the higher abundance of Cetobacterium. Cetobacterium is the core flora in the intestinal tract of fish (Jiajia et al., 2012). It can produce acetic acid to promote protein synthesis or combine with coenzyme A to boost sugar and fat metabolism and can synthesize fats, carbohydrates, and proteins for the host’s use (Lin et al., 2019). This suggests that Cetobacterium may play a vital role in the development and growth of fish. The abundance of Cetobacterium in the intestine of male swamp eels was 22.55%, and that in female swamp eels was 0.46%. The LEfSe analysis results showed that Cetobacterium was the differentially predominant species in male swamp eels. We speculate that it may play a key role in the sex reversal of swamp eels. The two groups of dominant symbiotic bacteria are Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1. It has the highest content in the healthy growth population and was the major member of intestinal bacteria in some fish (Sullam et al., 2012; Lopetuso et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2019). The abundance of Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 in the intestine of healthy piglets is higher, and decrease in its abundance may cause diarrhea in healthy piglets (Han et al., 2019). This suggests that Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 plays an essential role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. LEfSe analysis showed that Clostridium_sp_ND2, Mycobacterium, Alphaproteobacteria, and Bacilli are the dominant genus in female swamp eels, and the sex dependence of these bacteria may be related to the sex reversal of swamp eels. It is speculated that their existence may have a specific regulatory effect on the sex reversal of swamp eels. There are no reports on Clostridium_sp_ND2. Mycobacteria are commonly found in humans and animals with infectious diseases, so they are often reported as pathogens, but their role in swamp eels has not been reported. The role of these bacteria in the intestines of swamp eels needs further study.The Venn diagram (Figure 1) shows that 136 OTUs were shared between the female and male swamp eel samples, accounted for 36.66% and 79.07% of all OTUs in the two groups, respectively. The female swamp eels had more specific OTUs. The endemic species between the two groups were analyzed at the species level, which showed that the female endemic genera (>1%) comprised only Candidatus_Arthromitus. This suggested that although females had more specific OTUs, most of their relative abundances were less than 1%. Candidatus_Arthromitus may have protective functions on the intestines (Cox and Blaser, 2014). In this study, there were more male endemic bacteria (>1%). For example, Lysobacter_ximonensis, a member of this genus with strong proteolytic properties, is capable of cleaving various microorganisms (Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria) and nematodes (Christensen, 2005; Yassin et al., 2007), indicating that they have special biological functions in microbial ecosystems (Du et al., 2015). Lachnospiraceae can also synthesize butyric acid from undigested nutrients, and many extracts of Lachnospiraceae can be used as probiotics (Nava et al., 2010). The results showed that these endemic bacteria had specific functions. Interestingly, these endemic bacteria did not show dominant differences in the LEfSe analysis, but some symbiotic bacteria showed significant differences, indicating that these symbiotic bacteria may be sex-dependent. We therefore hypothesized that the abundance of these symbiotic bacteria might promote or delay the sex reversal process of swamp eels, which needs further study.The pituitary gland plays a vital role in sex reversal. Increased gonadotropic hormone (GTH) during sex differentiation induces female-to-male sex reversal in the swamp eel (Liu, 1944). Estradiol can regulate intestinal flora (Benedek et al., 2017). The colonization of microorganisms increased the level of serum testosterone (Markle et al., 2013). These findings indicate a meaningful relationship between sex hormones and intestinal microorganisms. Also, the effect of exogenous hormones on the secretion of sex hormones in swamp eels is similar to that in dioecious fish. The female has mainly an increase in estradiol, and the male primarily has an increase in testosterone. The above reports prove that both sex hormones and intestinal flora play a key role in the sex reversal of swamp eels. Our hypothesis is as follows. Consider a microbiota that interacts with GTH or sex hormones in the swamp eel. When it proliferates, the amount of GTH or sex hormone secretion in the swamp eel is increased (or decreased), thereby reaching to above (or below) the threshold of induced reversal, eventually causing sex reversal to start (or stop). It is difficult to determine whether the sex reversal of swamp eels is directly mediated by microflora. Additional studies are desirable to determine the causal role of microflora in the sex reversal of swamp eels and explore the mechanisms involved.Artificial breeding of swamp eels is a challenging task. We have conducted a long-duration experiment and achieved success after many failures. We have shown the great interestingness of this data. This study suggested that there are significant differences in the intestinal flora of male and female swamp eels. We speculated that sex reversal was partially related to the intestinal flora. These results provide useful information and a new research direction for the study of the sex reversal mechanism in swamp eels.The Alpha diversity of female swamp eels was higher than that of male swamp eels, and the species diversity of female swamp eels was also significantly higher (p < 0.05, Tukey’s HSD) than that of male swamp eels, as measured by the Shannon index. Beta diversity analysis showed significant differences in intestinal flora between male and female swamp eels.The relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Spirochaetes was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in female swamp eels than in male swamp eels at the phylum level. The relative abundance of Mycobacterium, Bacillus, and Vagococcus was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in female swamp eels than in male swamp eels at the genus level.LEfSe analysis showed that the dominant bacteria in male swamp eels were Cetobacterium, while those in the female swamp eels were Clostridium_sp_ND2, Mycobacterium, Alphaproteobacteria, and Bacilli.There was a significant difference in intestinal flora between male and female swamp eels. These dramatic differences between the sexes deserve a more in-depth study on sex reversal in the future.The datasets generated for this study can be found in the SRP230335.The animal study was reviewed and approved by the Animal care and use committee of Jiangxi Agricultural University.QZ and JZ designed the study.

Similar evidence of individual and sex differences in inhibitory abilities is also present in other vertebrates, but is scarce outside primates. Experiments on reversal learning, which requires inhibiting behaviours, suggest that this variability may exist in a teleost fish, the guppy, Poecilia reticulata. We tested this hypothesis by observing guppies in an inhibitory task. Guppies were exposed to unreachable prey inside a transparent tube for six trials. Guppies showed a marked reduction in the number of attempts to catch the prey within the first trial and also over repeated trials. We found a striking sex difference in the capacity to inhibit foraging behaviour. Males attempted to attack the prey twice as often as females and showed negligible improvement over trials. Irrespective of sex, individuals remarkably differed in their performance, with some guppies being systematically more skilled than others across the repeated trials. These results confirm that individual and sex differences in the ability to inhibit behaviour are not restricted to humans and other primates, suggesting that they might be widespread among vertebrates. Variability in inhibitory ability provides an explanation for emerging records of variability in other cognitive tasks in fish.This is a preview of subscription content, log in to check access.Agin V, Dickel L, Chichery R, Chichery MP (1998) Evidence for a specific short-term memory in the cuttlefish, Sepia.

Part of Springer Nature.The swamp eel (Monopterus albus) is a typical sex reversal fish with high economic value. Several phylogeographic studies have been performed using various markers but comparative research between mitochondrial and nuclear markers is rare. Here, a fine-scale study was performed across six sites along the Yangtze River including three sites on the main stem and three sites from tributaries. A total of 180 swamp eel individuals were collected. Genetic structure and demographic history were explored using data from two mitochondrial genes and eight microsatellite loci. The results revealed the samples from tributary sites formed three separate clades which contained site-specific lineages. Geographic isolation and the habitat patchiness caused by seasonal cutoff were inferred to be the reasons for this differentiation. Strong gene flow was detected among the sites along the main stem. Rapid flow of the river main stem may provide the dynamic for the migration of swamp eel. Interestingly, the comparative analyses between the two marker types was discordant. Mitochondrial results suggested samples from three tributary sites were highly differentiated. However, microsatellite analyses indicated the tributary samples were moderately differentiated. We conclude this discordance is mainly caused by the unique life history of sex reversal fish. Our study provides novel insights regarding the population genetics of sex reversal fish.Cite this asThe swamp eel (Monopterus albus) is a typical sex reversal fish, belonging to the family Synbranchidae, which usually inhabits swamps, ponds and rice fields (Nelson, Grande & Wilson, 2016). Due to its high nutritional value and good taste, the swamp eel is used as a significant aquatic food in China. In 2018, 0.32 million tons of swamp eel were produced by Chinese aquaculture (data from The Ministry of Agriculture of China, 2019).With the development of swamp eel farming, population genetic research of the wild eel became a hot topic, which has been used to guide the genetic breeding and swamp eel aquaculture. Several studies have used different markers including microsatellites, mitochondrial sequences and Inter-Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSR) to explore swamp eel population genetics (Lei et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013; Liang et al., 2016). Previous studies suggested a rapid decrease of wild swamp eel caused by the large use of pesticides and over-exploitation (Li et al., 2013; Liang et al., 2016). Cultured populations were genetically less diverse than wild populations. Due to farm escapes, the populations of wild swamp eel suffer from genetic homogenization and degeneration of genetic characters (Li et al., 2013). Thus, further research of population genetics and dynamics are necessary to protect the wild swamp eel.Monopterus albus is a sex reversal fish with a unique life history (Liu, 1944; Mazzoni et al., 2018; Qu, 2018). It starts the reproductive cycle as a functional female. During 1 to 1.5 years of age, females obtain well-developed ova. After spawning, the swamp eel’s sex is reversed from female to male. The intersexes appear in the two-year-old age class. Then it lives as male without sex reversal (Liem, 1963). Generally, swamp eels can live to 6-8 years. Mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherited. For this reason, the inheritance patterns of protogynous hermaphrodites differ to that of species that do not practice sex reversal (Coscia et al., 2016). Therefore, it may be important to include both nuclear and mitochondrial markers to explore the population genetics of sex reversal fish.This fine-scale study was performed across six sites along the Yangtze River including three sites on the main stem and three sites from tributaries. Subsequently, the genetic structure of these six sampling sites was explored, using sequence from two mitochondrial genes and eight microsatellite loci. Here, we show how different types of molecular markers can provide new insights regarding the population genetics of sex reversal fish.Procedures involving animals and their care were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences under approval number 201003076. Field experiments were approved by Fisheries Bureau of Anhui (project number: FB/AH 2017-10).A total of 180 individuals were collected using net from six sites along the Anhui basin of the Yangtze River (Table S1). Sampling sites from tributaries of the Yangtze River included Dang Tu (DT), Fan Chang (FC) and Huai Ning (HN); sampling sites from the main stem of the Yangtze River included Wu Wei (WW), Gui Chi (GC) and Wang Jiang (WJ) (Fig. 1).Total genomic DNA was extracted from muscle tissue using a standard phenol/chloroform procedure via proteinase K digestion (Sambrook, Fritsch & Maniatis, 1989), and then kept at −20 °C for PCR amplification.The mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and cytochrome b (Cyt b) gene were chosen. Two pairs of primers were designed here for the amplification (Table S2). PCR were conducted in 50 µL reaction mixtures containing 200 ng template DNA, 5 µL 10 × buffer (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), 4 µL MgCl2 (2.5 mol/L), 3 µL dNTP (2.5 m mol/L), 2 µL of each primer (5 µmol/L), and 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (5 U/ µL, TaKaRa). PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation (95 °C, 1 min), then 35 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 50 s), primer annealing (55 °C, 45 s), and elongation (72 °C, 1 min) and a final extension (72 °C, 10 min). All fragments were sequenced in both directions with an ABI3730 automated sequencer (Invitrogen Biotechnology Co., Ltd, USA). Then these two gene sequences were combined for subsequent analyses.Eight unlinked polymorphic microsatellite loci were selected from previous studies (Table S1) (Lei et al., 2012; Li et al., 2007; Zhuo et al., 2011). PCR were conducted in 50 µL reaction mixtures containing 200 ng template DNA, 5 µL 10 × buffer (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), 4 µL MgCl2 (2.5 mol/L), 2.5 µL dNTP (2.5 m mol/L), 2 µL of each primer (5 µmol/L), and 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (25 U/ µL, TaKaRa). PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation (95 °C, 5 min), then 32 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 30 s), primer annealing (57 °C, 60 s), and elongation (72 °C, 90 s) and a final extension (72 °C, 5 min). Genotypes were detected by ABIPRISM 3730.Sequences were assembled by DNASTAR Lasergene package. Subsequent homologous alignment was performed by Mafft v.7 online program (https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/) (Katoh, Rozewicki & Yamada, 2019).Haplotype and nucleotide diversity were estimated using DNAsp V.6 (Rozas et al., 2017). A haplotype network was constructed using Median Joining (MJ) in NETWORK v.5.0 (Bandelt, Forster & Röhl, 1999). Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) was performed using Arlequin v.3.11 (Excoffier, Laval & Schneider, 2005). Genetic variation within and among sampling sites was assessed. Pairwise Fst was estimated in order to evaluate the levels of population differentiation (Slatkin & Barton, 1989) and the P values were corrected using multiple testing.The demographic history was explored using three approaches, e.g., neutrality tests, mismatch distribution and Bayesian Skyline Plots (BSP) analyses. Tajima’s D (Tajima, 1989) and Fu’s Fs (Fu, 1997) values were calculated using DNAsp V.6.Mismatch distribution analyses were performed using Arlequin v.3.11 (Rogers & Harpending, 1992). The expansion time was calculated by the τ value with the equation τ=2 µt, where µrepresents the nucleotide mutation rate and t represents the estimated expansion time. BSP analysis was performed using Beast v1.10.4 (Suchard et al., 2018) under an uncorrelated relaxed clock mode for 5 × 107 generations.The results of 8 microsatellites loci were read using GeneMarker (Holland & Parson, 2011) and reformatted using Convert v.1.31 (Glaubitz, 2004). Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) tests were performed using Popgene v 1.32 (Yeh et al., 1997). Expected and observed heterozygosity were calculated with Arlequin v.3.11 (Rogers & Harpending, 1992). AMOVA was implemented with Arlequin. Pairwise Fst was computed based on Slatkin’s method (Slatkin & Barton, 1989). The geographical and genetic distance between sample sites was measured by GPS and Popgene v 1.32, respectively. The correlation between geographical and genetic distance was analyzed using Pcord v 5 (Grandin, 2006).Population structure was estimated using an MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) algorithm as implemented in Structure v.2.3.3 (Hubisz et al., 2009). The number of clusters (K) was calculated under 1 × 106 iterations with 10 replications and the optimal number of K was deduced by Structure Harvester Web v.0.6.94 (Evanno, Regnaut & Goudet, 2005; Earl, 2012).A total of 1752 bp of mitochondrial sequence (COI 665 bp, Accession number: MN097948–MN098127; Cyt b 1087 bp, Accession number: MN098128–MN098307) were obtained for analyses. The contents of the bases A, T, G and C were 24.6%, 29.3%, 14.6% and 31.5% respectively, which showed obvious anti-G bias (Saccone et al., 1999).The 180 mitochondrial sequences corresponded to 86 distinct haplotypes (Table 1). All haplotypes were divided into four clades based on MJ method (Fig. 2). Clade A was the largest one which contained samples from five sampling sites. Haplotype 5 (H-5) had the largest number of shared individuals, and its central placement in the network suggests that this is the ancestral haplotype. The other three clades were separated by 13, 47, 24 mutational steps, respectively. Clade B and C only contained samples from the HN and FC sampling sites, respectively. Clade D mainly consisted of DT samples.Notes. Hd represents haplotype diversity; Pi represents nucleotide diversity; He represents expected heterozygosity; Ho represents observed heterozygosity.Haplotype diversity ranged from 0.6620 to 0.9793 and nucleotide diversity ranged from 0.0017 to 0.0148 based on mitochondrial sequence (Table 1). The results of AMOVA showed that genetic variation among sampling sites (71.23%, P < 0.001) were much higher than the variation within the sampling sites (28.77%, P < 0.001) (Table 2A). Subsequent Fst values further confirmed this result. Strong gene flow was detected between the main stem sampling sites (Fst = 0.0242 between GC and WW, Fst = 0.0286 between WJ and WW, Fst = 0.0305 between WJ and GC, see Table 3A). And high differentiation was revealed between the tributary sampling sites (Fst = 0.3069 − 0.9431) (Table 3A). Fu’s Fs and Tajima’s D tests of main stem samples were significant (P < 0.01) but negative. No explicit expansion or decline were revealed for the tributary samples and the Fu’s Fs and Tajima’s D values except the Tajima’s D of FC were not significant (Table 4). Mismatch distribution analysis revealed similar results. The values of sum of squares deviations (SSD) for samples from main stem and DT were not significant (P > 0.05), indicating that sudden expansion could not be rejected (Table 4). The BSP analysis suggested the main stem samples had expanded roughly in 0.46 MYA (Fig. 3).Notes:The eight microsatellite loci amplified unambiguous and repeatable products in the size range expected. All loci were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P > 0.05). High genetic diversity was also supported by microsatellite data. Expected and observed heterozygosity for the six sampling sites were 0.8052 –0.8749 and 0.5958 –0.7917, respectively (Table 1).Structure results suggested the highest posterior probability for K = 4 (Fig. S1). The ΔK method revealed four potential genetic clusters, aligning with the three tributaries and all the main stem sites together. Samples from main stem showed high levels of genetic admixture (Fig. 4).AMOVA was performed using the microsatellite data and suggested that genetic variation was mainly within sampling sites (94.65%, P < 0.001), opposite to the results from mitochondrial data (Table 2B). Fst values suggested low levels of differentiation (Fst = 0.0005 − 0.0982) (Table 3B).The correlation between genetic and geographic matrixes was assessed using Mantel test (Table S3). The results suggested a significant correlation between them (r = 0.8791, P = 0.004) (Fig. 5).High levels of genetic diversity were found across sampling sites at both mitochondrial and microsatellite markers. The genetic diversity level of this study except FC sample site was higher than previous study in the same basin (Hd = 0.708 and Pi = 0.002 based on mitochondrial D-loop sequences) (Liang et al., 2016). The genetic diversity of FC samples was the lowest (Hd = 0.6620, Pi = 0.0017). The significant differentiation of three tributary sampling sites was revealed by the population genetic analyses (Fst >0.25). The haplotype network and structure results suggested the tributary samples formed three separate clades which contained site-specific lineages. Significant correlation between genetic and geographic distance was detected. Interestingly, strong gene flow was detected among the main stem sampling sites and the expansion of main stem samples was detected.It is well known that the swamp eel is a burrowing fish whose fins are vestigial or absent (Nelson, Grande & Wilson, 2016). Compared with most fishes, the swimming ability of eel is weak. Thus, we were curious about the reasons for this long-distance gene flow among main stem sampling sites. The flow rate of main stem in Anhui basin range up to 1.0 m/s (Guo & Xia, 2007). Rapid flow provides the dynamic for the migration of swamp eel. The eggs and juvenile fishes can slip downstream to the farther places. However, due to the flat stream gradient and curved channel, the tributary flow becomes slower (Zhang, YT & Jiang, 2008) and long-distance migration is difficult for swamp eel. We propose that geographic isolation and the habitat patchiness caused by seasonal cutoff are the reasons for the differentiation between tributary samples. The tributary of FC site was much more isolated from the main stem. It connected to the main stem during the wet season and isolated during the dry season. Long-term isolation from the main stem may cause the low genetic diversity of FC samples.Analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial markers revealed discordant population structure. Based on mitochondrial data, genetic variation was mainly found among sampling sites. Samples between the tributary sites were highly differentiated (Fst > 0.25) and represented three monophyletic clades. However, microsatellite analyses suggest that the majority of genetic variation is within these sampling sites; samples between the tributary sites were moderately differentiated (0.05 < Fst < 0.15). Mean Fst values among six sampling sites based on mitochondrial and microsatellite data were 0.548 and 0.055, respectively. The mean mitochondrial Fst value (0.548) was almost ten times higher than the Fst (0.055) estimated with microsatellite data.Our study provided an interesting pattern of discordance between markers for population genetics. According to previous studies, sex-biased dispersal, genetic admixture and lineage sorting may be the potential reasons for the discordance caused by different molecular markers (Funk & Omland, 2003; Qu et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2016; Zarza, Reynoso & Emerson, 2011). Considering the sex reversal in this species, we inferred the unique life history of the swamp eel contributed to this discordance. Initially, the swamp eel is female and provides both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA to the population genetic pool. After spawning, the swamp eel becomes male. Male swamp eels are much bigger and stronger than females. Males could migrate farther and have a higher survival rates, which provides a potential of male sex-biased dispersal. Due to mitochondrial maternal inheritance, male swamp eels only provide nuclear DNA to the population genetic pool (Fig. 6). So male sex-biased dispersal may cause the differences in population structure between the markers. As mentioned above, male stage is much longer than female stage in the whole life of swamp eel that may cause different genetic frequencies between mitochondrial and nuclear data. The ten–fold difference between mitochondrial and nuclear Fst values also confirmed this hypothesis.Our study used two data sets, mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites, to explore the demography, genetic variation and population structure of swamp eels. Compared with previous studies, high levels of genetic diversity suggest that swamp eels are an abundant resource in the Anhui basin and have potential commercial value. Samples from each tributary site in this study should be treated as an independent genetic unit. The unique sex reversal life history of the swamp eel may be a significant factor affecting the population genetic structure and may generate the discordance we found between different molecular markers. Our study provides novel insights regarding the population genetics of sex reversal fish.The authors declare there are no competing interests.Huaxing Zhou conceived and designed the experiments, analyzed the data, prepared figures and/or tables, authored or reviewed drafts of the paper, and approved the final draft.Yuting Hu conceived and designed the experiments, performed the experiments, authored or reviewed drafts of the paper, and approved the final draft.He Jiang conceived and designed the experiments, authored or reviewed drafts of the paper, and approved the final draft.Guoqing Duan analyzed the data, authored or reviewed drafts of the paper, and approved the final draft.Jun Ling performed the experiments, authored or reviewed drafts of the paper, and approved the final draft.Tingshuang Pan, Xiaolei Chen performed the experiments, prepared figures and/or tables, and approved the final draft.Huan Wang and Ye Zhang analyzed the data, prepared figures and/or tables, authored or reviewed drafts of the paper, and approved the final draft.The following information was supplied relating to ethical approvals (i.e., approving body and any reference numbers):Procedures involving animals and their care were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences under approval number 201003076.The following information was supplied relating to field study approvals (i.e., approving body and any reference numbers):Field experiments were approved by Fisheries Bureau of Anhui (project number: FB/AH 2017-10).The following information was supplied regarding data availability:The mitochondrial COI and Cyt b genes are available at GenBank: MN097948–MN098127 and MN098128–MN098307.

This inhibition is not seen in the estuarine killifish, or mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), even when exposed to 100 ng/L EE2. This relative insensitivity to EE2 exposure indicates species-specific mechanisms for compensating for exogenous estrogenic exposure. This review compares various reproductive responses elicited by EE2 in mummichog to other common model teleosts, such as zebrafish (Danio rerio) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), identifying key endpoints where mummichog differ from other studied fish. For example, EE2 accumulates primarily in the liver/gall bladder of mummichog, which is different than zebrafish and fathead minnow in which accumulation is predominantly in the carcass. Despite causing species-specific differences in fecundity, EE2 has been shown to consistently induce hepatic vitellogenin in males and cause feminization/sex reversal during gonadal differentiation in larval mummichog, similar to other species. In addition, while gonadal steroidogenesis and plasma steroid levels respond to exogenous EE2, it is generally at higher concentrations than observed in other species. In mummichog, production of 17β-estradiol (E2) by full grown ovarian follicles remains high; unlike other teleost models where E2 synthesis decreases as 17α,20β-dihydroxy-4-prenen-3-on levels increase to induce oocyte maturation. New evidence in mummichog indicates some dissimilarity in gonadal steroidogenic gene expression responses compared to gene expression responses in zebrafish and fathead minnow exposed to EE2. The role of ovarian physiology continues to warrant investigation regarding the tolerance of mummichog to exogenous EE2 exposure. Here we present a comprehensive review, highlighting key biological differences in response to EE2 exposure between mummichog and other commonly used model teleosts.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

One prominent example is the model fish species Oryzias latipes which has a stable XX/XY genetic sex determination system, but still responds to environmental cues, where high temperatures lead to female‐to‐male sex reversal. However, the mechanisms behind are still unknown. We show that high temperatures increase primordial germ cells (PGC) numbers before they reach the genital ridge, which, in turn, regulates the germ cell proliferation. Complete ablation of PGCs led to XX males with germ cell less testis, whereas experimentally increased PGC numbers did not reverse XY genotypes to female. For the underlying molecular mechanism, we provide support for the explanation that activation of the dmrt1a gene by cortisol during early development of XX embryos enables this autosomal gene to take over the role of the male determining Y‐chromosomal dmrt1bY.Volume86, Issue10Special Issue: Effects of environmental stress on reproduction and developmentOctober 2019Pages 1405-1417© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.We use cookies to help us improve this website. Learn more       Exposure to environmental stressors, such as high temperature (HT), during early development of fish induces sex reversal of genotypic females. Nevertheless, the involvement of the brain in this process is not well clarified. In the present work, we investigated the mRNA levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone b (crhb) and its receptors (crhr1 and crhr2), and found that they were upregulated at HT during the crucial period of gonadal sex determination in medaka. In order to clarify their roles in sex reversal, biallelic mutants for crhr1 and crhr2 were produced by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Remarkably, biallelic mutants of both loci (crhr1 and crhr2) did not undergo female-to-male sex reversal upon exposure to HT. Inhibition of this process in double corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor mutants could be successfully rescued through the administration of the downstream effector of the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis, cortisol. Taken together, these results reveal for the first time that the CNS acts as a transducer of masculinization induced by thermal stress.As a general trend, the response of the neuroendocrine system to environmental stressors is elevation of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh). Crh in turn stimulates the secretion and release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (Acth) from the pituitary gland (Aguilera and Liu, 2012; Kovács, 2013), which regulates cortisol levels through the adrenal gland (Mommsen et al., 1999). This is known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis or the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis in tetrapods and fish, respectively. In the latter, two crh ohnologs, named crha and crhb, have been identified (Grone and Maruska, 2015). The expression of crha has been mainly observed in the retina (Grone and Maruska, 2015; Hosono et al., 2015), with weak expression in the brain (about 100 times less than in retina) (Hosono et al., 2015), in fish. By contrast, crhb is mainly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), i.e. in the preoptic area, the hypothalamus and the caudal neurosecretory system. For this reason, it has been related to the control of Acth in the pituitary gland (Alderman and Bernier, 2009; Bernier et al., 2008; Carpenter et al., 2014; Chen and Fernald, 2008; Grone and Maruska, 2015).The action of Crh in the pituitary is mediated by the binding and activation of two highly conserved membrane receptors (Crhr1 and Crhr2), which belong to class B of the G protein-coupled receptors (Lovejoy et al., 2014). Although in tetrapods, it has been reported that Crh has higher affinity for Crhr1 (Vaughan et al., 1995), in teleosts both Crh ligands have similar affinity for both Crh receptors (Hosono et al., 2015). Several studies in mammals have also demonstrated the ability of Crh receptor antagonists to block stress responses, such as anxiety or depression (Backström and Winberg, 2013; Grammatopoulos and Chrousos, 2002; Holsboer and Ising, 2008), placing Crh receptors at a crucial point in regulation of the HPA axis.The molecular and morphological processes of masculinization by stress have been investigated at the local, gonadal level, in several species from nematodes (Chandler et al., 2012, 2008), fish (Hattori et al., 2007; Hayashi et al., 2010; Kitano et al., 2012) and amphibians (Nakamura, 2009), to reptiles (Ge et al., 2018; Mork et al., 2014; Yatsu et al., 2015), but the involvement of the brain in sex-reversal is still under scrutiny. In all these vertebrates, exposure to environmental stressors during early life has several implications in reproduction. For instance, when reptiles and fish are exposed to stress during the crucial period of gonadal differentiation, a strong bias in sex ratios can be induced (Capel, 2017; Fernandino et al., 2013). The downstream factors involved in stress-induced masculinization in fish are well known (Hattori et al., 2009; Hayashi et al., 2010; Mankiewicz et al., 2013; Ribas et al., 2017; Tsalafouta et al., 2014; Yamaguchi et al., 2010). These factors can act by three different mechanisms: (1) inhibition of estrogen synthesis (Kitano et al., 2012; Nozu and Nakamura, 2015), (2) elevation of androgen synthesis (Fernandino et al., 2012; Hattori et al., 2009), and (3) apoptosis or meiotic arrest of germ cells (Yamaguchi and Kitano, 2012; Yamamoto et al., 2013). However, the molecular processes and key players controlling cortisol increase, which regulates these three mechanisms, remain unexplored.In this study, we provide clear evidence of the role of the CNS in regulation of the HPI axis, shedding light on the triggering mechanism of masculinization induced by environmental factors.First, we examined the regulation of both crh paralogs under normal and masculinizing temperature. The mRNA levels of crha and crhb were analyzed in medaka embryos at stages 26, 33 and 37, incubated at control (24°C; CT) or high (32°C; HT) temperatures (Fig. 1). No differences were detected for crha between treatments, at any of the developmental stages examined (Fig. 1A). In contrast, we observed high transcript levels of crhb under HT conditions at stage 37, corresponding to the gonadal sex determination period (Fig. 1B). It is noteworthy that the expression levels of both crha and crhb were not affected by the sex genotype (XX versus XY) (Fig. S1).crhb is upregulated by thermal stress during the gonadal sex determination period. (A,B) Developmental profiles of crha (A) and crhb (B) transcript abundance in embryos reared at 24°C (control temperature) and 32°C (high temperature). Data were measured by qPCR analysis in whole embryos at stages 26, 33 and 37. Gene expression levels are expressed relative to the stage 26 group with 24°C treatment. Quantification was performed using the 2−ΔΔCt method and values were normalized to rpl7. Genotypic sex was determined at stages 33 and 37 by the presence/absence of the dmy gene; XX and XY are represented by filled circles and open circles, respectively. Horizontal bars indicate mean, with its respective s.e.m. P-values are indicated when transcript abundance between temperature treatments at the same developmental stage differ statistically (REST; P<0.05). NS, not statistically significant.Based on the upregulation of crhb at stage 37 in embryos incubated at HT, we analyzed the transcript abundance of other HPI-related genes, such as the Crh receptor genes crhr1 and crhr2; the three urocortins, urocortin [Ucn; also known as sauvagine (Svg) and urotensin 1 (Uts1)], urocortin 2 (Ucn2) and urocortin 3 (Ucn3) (Fig. 2A) (Hosono et al., 2017); and acth (Liu et al., 2003). The expression of both crhr1 and crhr2 (Fig. 2E,F), was upregulated at HT. No significant differences were observed in the transcript abundance of the other Crh-like genes, i.e. uts1, ucn2 and ucn3 (Fig. 2B-D), or acth (Fig. 2G), suggesting that these HPI axis-related genes are not regulated at the transcriptional level during exposure to thermal stress in early development.Regulation of HPI-related genes during the gonadal sex determination period under HT treatment.

These data were measured by qPCR analysis in whole embryos at stage 37. Gene expression levels are expressed relative to the 24°C treatment.

Genotypic sex was determined by the presence/absence of the dmy gene; XX and XY are represented by filled circles and open circles, respectively.

P-values are indicated when transcript abundance between temperature treatments at the same developmental stage differ statistically (REST; P<0.05). NS, not statistically significant.To analyze the participation of the HPI axis in temperature-induced masculinization, we disrupted this axis through biallelic mutations (indels in F0 individuals created by injecting cas9 and sgRNA) of crhr1 or/and crhr2 using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Biallelic mutations of both Crh receptors generated indels in the transmembrane domain resulting in a receptor with a protein segment that fails to anchor into the membrane lipid bilayer, and is therefore unable to activate the intracellular G protein (Grammatopoulos, 2012). Thus, the sgRNAs for crhr1 and crhr2 genes were designed at exons 7 (located in transmembrane helix 3) and 10 (located in transmembrane helix 6; Fig. S2A), respectively. These sgRNAs were synthesized in vitro, and co-injected with nCas9n RNA (cas9) into one-cell-stage embryos. The mutagenesis efficiency for each sgRNA was analyzed by a heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA; Fig. S2B) (Ota et al., 2013), which reached 96.6% (29/30; embryos with biallelic mutations/total of eggs injected) for sgRNA-crhr1 and 100% (30/30) for sgRNA-crhr2 (Fig. S3A,B). Also, biallelic mutants were mated with wild-type fish to generate F1 and then each Crh receptor was sequenced to confirm presence of the indels (Fig. S2C). Data indicate that most cells contained biallelic indels and, consequently, loss of function in crhr1 and crhr2 mutants. None of the embryos analyzed presented indels at the off-target sites for each of the injected sgRNAs of biallelic mutants (Fig. S3A,B).Furthermore, no alterations in morphology or survival rate were observed in a batch of biallelic mutant animals reared at 24°C (CT) up to 60 days post-hatching (dph) (Fig. S4).In order to assess the participation of Crh-related genes in the sex reversal of genotypic females to phenotypic males induced by HT, we analyzed the expression of well-known gene markers for gonadal sex differentiation in fish, such as gsdf, sry-box9 type 2α (sox9a2), gonadal aromatase (cyp19a1a, the gene encoding the aromatase enzyme involved in the synthesis of estrogen) and hydroxysteroid 11-beta dehydrogenase 2 (hsd11b2, the gene encoding the 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 11β-HSD, which catalyzes the interconversion of cortisol and cortisone, and the synthesis of 11-oxygenated androgens) (Chakraborty et al., 2016; Fernandino et al., 2012; Imai et al., 2015; Kurokawa et al., 2007; Nakamura et al., 2012; Shibata et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2016). Fertilized eggs were co-injected with cas9 RNA and sgRNA for each Crh receptor (cas9+sgRNA-crhr1 or cas9+sgRNA-crhr2) alone or together (cas9+sgRNA-crhr1+-crhr2) and they were then incubated at HT (32°C). Control fertilized eggs were injected only with cas9 and then incubated at CT and HT (cas9-24°C and cas9-32°C, respectively; Fig. 3A). In all treatments, genotypic females (XX) that presented indels were selected for analysis of gene expression at stage 37. As expected, cas9-32°C individuals presented higher levels of gsdf and sox9a2, and lower cyp19a1a expression levels compared with cas9-24°C individuals (Fig. 3B-D), evidencing the molecular mechanism of action of masculinization induced by HT. However, the double biallelic Crh receptor mutants of genotypic females at HT showed a female pattern of lower gsdf and sox9a2 and higher cyp19a1a expression levels, resembling those of the cas9-24°C group (Fig. 3B-D).Genotypic female biallelic Crh receptor mutants did not show HT-induced masculinization.

(B-F) Transcript abundance profiles of the testicular genes markers gsdf and sox9a2 (B,C), the ovarian gene marker cyp19a1a (D), the interrenal gland gene marker cyp11b (E) and the androgen-related gene hsd11b2 (F), in control (cas9-injected embryos reared at 24°C and 32°C) and biallelic Crh receptor mutants (cas9+sgRNA-crhr1, cas9+sgRNA-crhr2 and cas9+sgRNA-crhr1+-crhr2 co-injected embryos reared at 32°C). These data were measured by qPCR analysis in whole embryos with genotypic sex XX at stage 37. Gene expression levels are expressed relative to the cas9-injected 24°C treatment group. Quantification was performed using the 2−ΔΔCt method and values were normalized to rpl7. Horizontal bars indicate mean, with its respective s.e.m. Different letters indicate statistically significant differences between treatments (one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test; P<0.05).When each biallelic Crh receptor mutant of XX embryos was analyzed, the gene expression pattern showed an intermediate phenotype, with high gsdf, sox9a2 and cyp19a1a (Fig. 3B-D). Here, it is necessary to take into account that in the biallelic mutant of each Crh receptor, the crhr paralog is fully active. We also analyzed the expression pattern of the androgen-related gene hsd11b2, which did not show differences between treatments (Fig. 3F).Besides the expression of testis and ovary-related gene markers, we also analyzed gonadal morphology of XX biallelic Crh receptor mutants that were incubated at CT and HT until hatching, and thereafter at 26°C (breeding temperature) for 20 dph, when the gonad could be morphologically well differentiated. Firstly, we analyzed the impact of biallelic mutation on the sex reversal of XX individuals incubated at 24°C injected with cas9, biallelic crhr1, crhr2 and double Crh receptor mutants, in which no sex reversal individuals were found (Fig. 4A,B). In XX juveniles injected with cas9 (control) and incubated at HT until hatching, 68.8% exhibited sex reversal, as evidenced by testis morphology (Fig. 4A,C). The double biallelic Crh receptor mutants showed a wide-ranging insensitivity to HT-induced female-to-male sex reversal, with nearly all XX individuals presenting normal ovary morphology (Fig. 4A,B). Moreover, 19% of the biallelic crhr1 mutants exhibited sex reversal (Fig. 4A,C). However, 9.25% were presumptive intersex individuals, i.e. animals with ovaries containing spermatocytes (ova-testis; Fig. 4D). Finally, in XX biallelic crhr2 mutant juveniles 35% presented sex reversal and 10% had intersex gonads (Fig. 4A,C,D).Participation of Crh receptors in the sex reversal induced by HT. (A) Percentages of genetic females (XX) exhibiting different gonadal morphologies – ovary (gray), testis with spermatocytes (dark blue), intersex (oocytes with spermatocytes; light blue) – in embryos injected with cas9 (control), cas9+sgRNA-crhr1, cas9+sgRNA-crhr2 and cas9+sgRNA-crhr1+sgRNA-crhr2. The number of medaka juveniles analyzed in each treatment is shown in parentheses. Different letters indicate statistically significant differences between treatments (hypothesis testing to compare two population proportions, Z-test, P<0.05). (B-D) Examples of the different gonadal morphologies observed. OC, oocytes; SC, spermatocytes.As we previously did not observe a correlation between the upregulation of crhb and the abundance of acth transcripts (Figs 1 and 2), we measured Acth-immunoreactive (Acth-ir) cells using immunofluorescence in the pituitary of genotypic female embryos at stage 39, with or without functional receptors, incubated at CT or HT (Fig. 5A). Firstly, we observed differences in the fluorescence intensity of the Acth-ir cells in XX embryos incubated at control and high temperature (Fig. 5B,C,H), suggesting that thermal stress induces Acth release. Moreover, we measured Acth-ir in biallelic Crh receptor mutants and observed higher fluorescence intensity compared with cas9 embryos incubated at HT (Fig. 5C-F, Fig. S5), resembling the XX cas9 control (24°C) embryos (Fig. 5B, Fig. S5). These results show that the biallelic mutation of Crh receptors in XX embryos causes accumulation of Acth in pituitary cells, indicating that both Crh receptors are involved in Acth release in the stress response induced by high temperature.Biallelic mutations of Crh receptors inhibit Acth release, losing the increase of cortisol induced by HT. (A) Schematic of the pituitary gland. Hyp, hypothalamus; PI, pars intermedia; PN, pars nervosa; PPD, proximal pars distalis; RPD, rostral pars distalis. (B-F) Fluorescent images of Acth-ir cells in the pituitary of embryos injected with cas9 RNA at 24°C (B), cas9 RNA at 32°C (C), and cas9+sgcrhr1+sgcrhr2 (D), cas9+sgcrhr1 (E) and cas9+sgcrhr2 (F) co-injected embryos reared at 32°C until stage 39. (G) Negative control (incubation with secondary antibody alone). (H) Quantification of cortisol levels in embryos injected with cas9 (controls at 24°C and 32°C), cas9+sgRNA-crhr1, cas9+sgRNA-crhr2 or cas9+both Crh receptor sgRNAs at 32°C. Horizontal bars indicate mean, with its respective s.e.m. Different letters indicate statistically significant differences between treatments (one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test; P<0.05).To corroborate that biallelic mutations of Crh receptors do disrupt the HPI axis, the level of cortisol and the mRNA expression of P450 11-beta (cyp11b), an enzyme expressed by the interrenal gland and involved in cortisol synthesis (Montero et al., 2015), were measured in all treatment groups. We observed in both biallelic crhr1 and crhr2 mutants an increase of cortisol levels at the end of the gonadal sex determination period, whereas the levels of cortisol in the double biallelic Crh receptor mutants were completely suppressed (Fig. 5H). Additionally, cyp11b was upregulated at HT but downregulated in the double biallelic Crh receptor mutants to low transcriptional levels similar to those observed at the control temperature (Fig. 3E), showing that the pathway involved in the synthesis of cortisol is transcriptionally active.In view of the fact that the entire HPI axis seems to be functional during the crucial period of gonadal fate and the biallelic mutations in Crh receptors inhibited masculinization of genotypic females incubated at HT, we decided to test whether the addition of cortisol could rescue the absence of sex reversal in the mutants. Therefore, we performed an experiment in which all embryos were maintained in an embryo medium with or without cortisol (5 µM) from fertilization to 5 dph (Fig. 6A) (Hayashi et al., 2010). The double biallelic Crh receptor mutants exhibited transcription consistent with the phenotype of XX at HT, with a low transcript abundance of gsdf (Fig. 6B), i.e. a typical XX-24°C gsdf expression pattern.Rescue of masculinization in biallelic Crh receptor mutants by cortisol treatment. (A) Schematic of the experimental procedure. (B) Gene expression profile of the testicular gene marker gsdf was analyzed in embryos injected with cas9 (control), cas9+sgRNA-crhr1, cas9+sgRNA-crhr2 and cas9+sgRNA-crhr1+sgRNA-crhr2 then treated with cortisol (5 µM) or vehicle (ethanol) between fertilization and 5 dph at 32°C. (C,D) Quantification of crhr2 (C) and crhr1 (D) expression in cas9+sgRNA-crhr1 and -crhr2 co-injected larvae, respectively. Gene expression levels are expressed relative to cas9+sgRNA-crhr1 without cortisol treatment (in B) and to cas9 treatment (in C,D). Data were measured by qPCR in whole embryos with the genotypic sex XX. Quantification was performed using the 2−ΔΔCt method and values were normalized to rpl7. Horizontal bars indicate mean, with its respective s.e.m. Different letters indicate statistically significant differences between treatments (REST; P<0.05). (E) Schematic of the proposed mechanism by which the CNS, through corticotropin-releasing hormone b (crhb) and its receptors (crhr1 and crhr2), transduces stress-induced masculinization.Finally, XX biallelic crhr1 mutants, treated with or without cortisol at HT, presented high levels of gsdf, similar to those of control XX cas9-injected larvae (Fig. 6B), suggesting that the XX biallelic crhr1 mutation is not sufficient to induce a female (low) pattern of gsdf. These results are in agreement with the high level of cortisol observed at stage 39 (Fig. 5H). However, XX biallelic crhr2 mutant larvae reared at HT maintained low transcript abundance of gsdf (Fig. 6B), a typical female-like expression pattern. Most importantly, XX biallelic crhr2 mutants reared with 5 µM cortisol at HT showed a male-like (high) gsdf expression pattern, similar to that of XX cas9-injected XX fish (Fig. 6B). To better understand the compensatory molecular mechanism, we analyzed the transcript abundance of crhr2 and crhr1 in the XX biallelic crhr1 and crhr2 mutants, respectively. We observed upregulation of crhr2 in the XX biallelic crhr1 mutants (Fig. 6C), but not of crhr1 in XX biallelic crhr2 mutant larvae (Fig. 6D), suggesting a molecular compensatory mechanism.Environmental factors that act during the crucial period of fish gonadal development are able to alter sex ratios, especially toward males (Fernandino et al., 2013; Ospina-Álvarez and Piferrer, 2008). Despite established genotypic sex-determining mechanisms with known sex-determining genes, many fish species produce male-skewed sex ratios when environmental temperatures are elevated during early development. However, whether this phenomenon has any adaptive value or not is unknown for the vast majority of species. Although understanding of this mechanism is of great interest for basic biology and from the perspective of global climate change, the pathways that mediate environmental cues and gonadal fate, and the involvement of extra-gonadal organs in this process, are still unknown. Our results demonstrate for the first time the fundamental role of the CNS as the transducer in a form of environmental sex determination (ESD), through regulation of the HPI axis.In the current work we demonstrated that, during the gonadal sex determination period, the HPI axis is active. Moreover, we proved that out of two crh paralogs, only crhb was upregulated at high masculinizing temperatures along embryonic development. In medaka, the crha gene was previously misidentified as a new member of Crh family and named as telocortin (tcn). The expression of crha has been mainly observed in the retina, with a weak expression in the brain (Hosono et al., 2015). In another teleost, Astatotilapia burtoni, the presence of crha has been related to the mediation of social information or stress responses in the visual system, facilitating signal processing before it even reaches the brain (Grone and Maruska, 2015). These previous results are in concordance with our observation that crha transcription does not seem to be induced by environmental stressors, such as high temperature. Besides crha and crhb, other members of the Crh gene family are present in the medaka genome, such as the uts1, ucn2 and ucn3 (Hosono et al., 2017). Known as urocortins, these genes code for neuropeptides that share structural similarity with Crh proteins and can act as additional endogenous ligands for Crh receptors. In mice, they have been involved in stress responses and also anxiety (Bale and Vale, 2004; Sztainberg and Chen, 2012). Nevertheless, none of the urocortins was upregulated during the sex determination period at high, masculinization temperature.The high expression of crhb we observed at HT is in agreement with results of other well-known stress responses, including its role in regulating the release of glucocorticoids (Alderman and Bernier, 2009; Carpenter et al., 2014; Chen and Fernald, 2008; Grone and Maruska, 2015). Moreover, a similar pattern was obtained for the Crh receptors (crhr1 and crhr2), which are crucial for activation of the HPI axis (Lovejoy and de Lannoy, 2013) during the gonadal sex determination period. In medaka, the first peak of cortisol occurs in 2 dph larvae, when animals are reared at normal breeding temperatures (Trayer et al., 2013). However, Hayashi et al. (2010) and our study showed an early rise in cortisol in embryos reared at HT, at the time of the gonadal sex determination period, evidencing an earlier activation of mechanisms involved in the surge of cortisol levels. In this regard, the high expression of crhb and the receptors crhr1 and crhr2 in our study is consistent with the timing of cortisol increase. Notably, overlap between the timing of early activation of the HPI axis and the gonadal sex determination period is crucial for understanding how high levels of cortisol are triggered and are related to male-skewed sex ratio (Hattori et al., 2009; Hayashi et al., 2010). Subsequently, in order to validate our hypothesis, we disrupted the HPI axis with biallelic mutation of both Crh receptors. These mutants were characterized by a lack of cortisol response at HT, downregulation of testicular gene markers, and concomitant inhibition of sex reversal (masculinization in XX) induced by stress. Thus, double biallelic Crh receptor mutants phenocopied the previous results on the inhibition of cortisol synthesis, with the absence of sex reversal in genotypic females (Hayashi et al., 2010). These observations demonstrate for the first time participation of the brain in stress-induced masculinization.In all vertebrates, Crh regulates the synthesis and release of Acth (Mommsen et al., 1999; Wendelaar Bonga, 1997) through their transmembrane receptors in the pituitary gland (Lovejoy et al., 2014). In the present work, although acth transcript abundance did not show any change during the gonadal sex determination period and under stress conditions, we detected low intensities of Acth-ir in HT embryos, which could be explained by a stimulation of Acth release, or the lack of peptide synthesis (Aguilera and Liu, 2012; Kovács, 2013), induced by thermal stress. Moreover, biallelic mutations of both Crh receptors resulted in more Acth in the pituitary, phenocopying the high fluorescence pattern of the control group. Furthermore, this Acth accumulation and/or the lack of its release are in concordance with the complete suppression of cortisol levels observed in the loss-of-function Crh receptor mutants. Therefore, the strong decrease in cortisol level of the double Crh receptor mutants resembled the absence of a stress response observed without an environmental stressor, with the concomitant absence of female sex reversal. In addition, the double Crh receptor mutant phenocopied previous results observed after inhibition of cortisol synthesis in medaka (Hayashi et al., 2010), with the absence of sex reversal. Such disruption of the HPI axis was demonstrated to be crucial for female-to-male sex reversal in our studies with medaka under high, stressful temperatures.An in-depth analysis of the molecular responses to loss of function of each Crh receptor under thermal stress showed that, whereas embryos co-injected with cas9+sgRNA-crhr1 or crhr2 presented an early inhibition of gsdf expression, high Acth-ir intensity and body cortisol level were observed at the end of the gonadal sex determination period when only one of the Crh receptor genes was biallelically mutated. Initially, it is necessary to take into account that in each biallelic Crh receptor mutant the paralog is fully active, which would generate a late compensatory effect, explaining the late high levels of cortisol at the end of the gonadal sex determination period, with the concomitant partial rescue of the sex reversal. Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanism of each biallelic Crh receptor mutant differs. In the biallelic crhr1 mutants, a transcriptional compensatory effect was observed with the upregulation of crhr2, which could establish the high Acth-ir intensity and cortisol level. However, in the biallelic crhr2 mutants, the transcription of crhr1 did not change. Therefore, the high Acth-ir intensity in these crhr1 biallelic mutants could be explained by a late inhibition of Acth release, leading to a high level of cortisol. In mammals, both Crh and Crhr1 are associated with the HPA axis at the initial stress response, whereas Crhr2 plays a major role during chronic and later responses to stress (Lovejoy and de Lannoy, 2013). Crhr1 knockout mice showed reduced stress-induced release of Acth and corticosterone, providing evidence that Crhr1 mediates stress-induced hormone activation (Smith et al., 1998; Timpl et al., 1998). On the other hand, Crhr2-deficient mice exhibited hypersensitivity of the HPA axis to stress (Bale et al., 2000), presenting a later decrease of plasma Acth and an increase of corticosterone, suggesting that Crhr2 is also involved in the maintenance of HPA axis drive (Coste et al., 2000). In view of these considerations, our data showing the loss of crhr2 function provide a similar regulatory mechanism to that reported in mice, resulting in a late decrease of Acth release, but with a high level of cortisol. Nevertheless, the loss of crhr1 function in medaka presented a novel molecular compensatory mechanism: upregulation of crhr2, promoting late synthesis of Acth, with a concomitant high level of cortisol. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of the involvement of both Crh receptors in fish masculinization induced by environmental stressors.Once the HPI axis has translated the stimulus of an environmental stressor, is important to know how cortisol transduces this response to masculinize the gonad. In some fish, including medaka, it has been proposed that gonadal aromatase, an enzyme involved in estradiol synthesis, or other genes related to its regulation, such as FTZ-F1 (the ortholog of mammalian steroidogenic factor1), are inhibited by cortisol (Hayashi et al., 2010; Navarro-Martín et al., 2011; Yamaguchi et al., 2010). Furthermore, in pejerrey (Odontesthes bonariensis) it has been suggested that androgens, synthesized through the action of hsd11b2, are considered as mediators of stress (Fernandino et al., 2012, 2013). Our results confirm that cyp19a1a transcription is suppressed at HT and demonstrate that high transcription levels can be rescued in double biallelic Crh receptor mutants.Three different results – (1) disruption of the HPI axis, (2) the increase of testicular gene markers with the concomitant decrease of sex reversal of genotypic females, and (3) the rescue of masculinization with cortisol – support the fact that the CNS is involved in sex reversal induced by environmental stressors (as summarized in Fig. 6E), in contrast to genotypic sex determination in which the sexual fate decision begins from the gonad.Fertilized eggs of Oryzias latipes were incubated in 70 mm Petri dishes with embryo medium (17 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM KCl, 0.27 mM CaCl2·2H2O and 0.66 mM MgSO4; pH 7) at 24°C (CT) or 32°C (HT). Sampling was performed at stages 26, 33, 37 and 39, and at 5, 20 or 60 days post-hatching (dph) (Iwamatsu, 2004). These stages correspond to the end of primordial germ cell (PGC) migration and the formation of the gonadal primordium (stage 26), the beginning of dmy/dmrt1bY transcription in gonadal somatic cells (stage 33), the sexual dimorphism in PGC proliferation (stage 35-37), and to the maximum PGCs proliferation in XX embryos and latest embryo stage of the gonadal sex determination period (stage 39) (Saito et al., 2007). Based on previous work, we know that 5-dph larvae are sensitive to cortisol treatment (Hayashi et al., 2010), that 20-dph fish can easily be assessed for gonadal sex morphology, and that 60-dph animals have grown as adult fish so can be used to assess survival. The strain hi-medaka (ID: MT835) was supplied from the National BioResource Project (NBRP) Medaka (www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/medaka/). All fish were maintained and fed following standard protocols to medaka (Kinoshita et al., 2012). Fish were handled in accordance with the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare Handbook on the Care and Management of Laboratory Animals (www.ufaw.org.uk) and internal institutional regulations.Total RNA was extracted from individual embryos using the RNAqueous-Micro kit (Ambion by Life Technologies) for stage 26, the Illustra RNAspin Mini for stage 33, and 350 µl of TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies) for stages 37, 39 and 5 dph, following the manufacturer's instructions. To perform cDNA synthesis, RNA of each individual sample (250 ng) was treated with Deoxyribonuclease I Amplification Grade (Life Technologies) and reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II (Life Technologies) with oligo(dT) following the manufacturer's instructions. Each primer pair was previously validated by analyzing the melting curve, requiring an efficiency of 95-105%, with a slope of around −3.30 and R2 value>0.99. Real-time PCR primers are listed in Table S1. Samples were analyzed with the Step One Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The amplification protocol consisted of an initial cycle of 1 min at 95°C, followed by 10 s at 95°C and 30 s at 60°C for a total of 45 cycles. The subsequent quantification method was performed using the 2−ΔΔCt method (threshold cycle; assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/cms_040980.pdf) and normalized against reference gene values for ribosomal protein L7 (rpl7) (Zhang and Hu, 2007).Each embryo of stages 33, 37 and 39, and each 5-dph and 20-dph larva was analyzed to determine its genotypic sex. Animals were subjected to DNA analysis for the presence of the dmy/dmrt1bY gene. For this purpose, we collected DNA from each RNA extraction following manufacturer's instructions. PCR analysis was then performed using primers for dmy (Nanda et al., 2002) and the presence of β-actin gene was used as a DNA loading control (Table S1) (Hattori et al., 2007). The PCR products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel.CRISPR/Cas9 target sites were designed using the CCTop-CRISPR/Cas9 target online predictor (crispr.cos.uni-heidelberg.de/index.html) (Stemmer et al., 2015), which identified the sequences 5′GG-(N18)-NGG3′ in exon 7 of crhr1 (TTGAGGAACATCATCCACTGG) and exon 10 of crhr2 (GAGGCAGCAAGACGAGTGTGG) (Fig. S2A,C). Each sgRNA was synthesized by cloning the annealed oligonucleotides into the sgRNA expression vector pDR274 (Addgene #42250) (Hwang et al., 2013) followed by in vitro transcription, previously established by Ansai and Kinoshita (2014). Briefly, a pair of oligonucleotides at final concentration of 10 mM each was annealed in 10 ml of annealing buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 20 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM NaCl) by heating to 95°C for 2 min and then cooling slowly to 25°C. Then, the pDR274 vector was digested with BsaI-HF (New England Biolabs), and the annealed oligonucleotides were ligated into the pDR274 vector. The sgRNA expression vectors were digested by DraI, and sgRNAs were synthesized using the MEGAshortscript T7 Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The synthesized sgRNAs were purified by RNeasy Mini kit purification (Qiagen). These RNA sequences were diluted to 50 ng/µl.The capped cas9 (nCas9n RNA) was transcribed from pCS2-nCas9n plasmid (Addgene #47929). First, the plasmid was linearized by NotI and capped cas9 was synthesized by mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 kit (Life Technologies). The synthesized cas9 was purified by RNeasy Mini kit purification (Qiagen) and RNAs were diluted to 200 ng/µl.Microinjection was performed into fertilized medaka eggs before the first cleavage as described previously (Kinoshita et al., 2000). For the CRISPR/Cas9 system, 25 ng/µl sgRNA and 100 ng/µl cas9 were co-injected in 4.6 nl of RNA mixture. Embryos injected with cas9 were used as controls. Microinjection was performed with a Nanoject II Auto-Nanoliter Injector (Drummond Scientific) coupled to a stereomicroscope (Olympus).To analyze the efficiency and specificity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, 3 days post-fertilization embryos were used (Ansai and Kinoshita, 2014). Genomic DNA was extracted by incubating each medaka embryo in 25 µl of 5 mM NaOH, 0.2 mM EDTA at 95°C for 5 min. After cooling to room temperature (RT) 25 µl of 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was added to the extract. The supernatant was used as template for PCR for HMA. Conventional PCR analysis was performed with genomic DNA using primers listed in Table S1. Electrophoresis was performed on 12% acrylamide gel (Ota et al., 2013); gels were stained with ethidium bromide for 15 min before examination. Multiple heteroduplex bands shown by HMA in PCR amplicons from each injected embryo were quantified as embryos with biallelic mutations, whereas single bands were quantified as no-edited embryos (Fig. S2B). The mutation rate was calculated as the ratio of the number of multiple heteroduplex bands shown in PCR amplicons from each Cas9-sgRNA-injected embryo to the sum of all embryos injected multiplied by 100 (n=30/per sgRNA) (Ansai and Kinoshita, 2014).Potential off-target sites in the medaka genome for each sgRNAs were searched using a ‘Pattern Match’ tool in New Medaka Map (beta) at the NBRP medaka web site (http://viewer.shigen.info/medakavw/patternmatch) and CCTop-CRISPR/Cas9 target online predictor (Stemmer et al., 2015). All potential off-target sites identified were analyzed by HMA using the primers listed in Table S1.Finally, the screening of indels was performed in F1 fish. Biallelic mutant adult (F0) medaka were mated with wild-type medaka of the Himedaka strain (WT). Genomic DNA was extracted from each F1 embryo for analysis of mutations by HMA, as described previously (Table S1). Mutant alleles in each embryo were determined by direct sequencing of the crhr1 or crhr2 gene region.Samples for histological examination of gonadal sex (n=15-25/per group) were taken at 20 dph and analyzed following the criteria reported above. Firstly, the caudal fin was taken for gDNA extraction using conventional saline buffer extraction to determine genotypic sex and for HMA analysis (Aljanabi and Martinez, 1997). The body trunk was fixed in Bouin's solution and processed according to standard protocols for the preparation of Hematoxylin & Eosin-stained histological sections. These preparations were examined under a Nikon ECLIPSE Ni-U microscope (Nikon) and captured using a Digit Sight DS-Fi2 digital camera (Nikon).Medaka embryos at stage 39 from different treatment groups were used. All individuals were processed under the same conditions for fixation, washing and incubation with serum and antibody. Stage 39 was chosen for analysis of the release of Acth upon upregulation of crhb, which was detected at stage 37. The tail was used for sex genotying by PCR and HMA analysis and the rest of the body was fixed in Bouin's solution overnight. Sections were then washed with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS pH 7.4) and blocked in 0.1 M PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 60 min before overnight incubation with a mixture of primary antibody against ACTH-NIDDK-anti-hATCH-IC-3 (rabbit, 1:250; kindly provided by Dante Paz, Universidad de Buenos Aires) (Garrel et al., 2002) at RT. After incubation, the sections were washed twice in PBS for 10 min each and incubated at RT for 90 min with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG (ThermoFisher Scientific, A-11008) at a dilution of 1:2000 in PBS. Separate sets of slides were treated only with secondary antibody (negative controls). After incubation, sections were rinsed twice with PBS and mounted with Fluoromount mounting medium (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 5 µg/ml, Life Technologies). Section photographs were taken using a Nikon Eclipse E7000 and Image Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics) with the same capture conditions of exposure and gain for all samples. Finally, images were analyzed and measured for fluorescence using ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) using fluorescence intensity within the pituitary gland relative to mean background fluorescence.Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was performed using the Cortisol Express EIA Kit according to instructions from the manufacturer (Cayman Chemical) and previously used by our group (Fernandino et al., 2012). Briefly, pools of 23-25 embryos of each treatment and from both sexes were frozen at −80°C, homogenized in 0.2 ml of PBS, and used for steroid extraction with 1 ml of diethyl ether. This procedure was repeated two times. After evaporation of the diethyl ether, samples were immediately re-suspended in 2 ml EIA buffer and analyzed in a microplate reader (Rayto Model RT-2100C) following the kit instructions. The recovery rate was estimated by the cold-spike method to be 0.85% and the intra- and inter-assay variation (CV%) ranged from 4 to 13%.Both cas9+sgRNA-crhr1 and/or +sgRNA-crhr2 co-injected fish were treated with 5 µM of cortisol (18) (11β-11,17,21-trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione; Sigma-Aldrich) from fertilization to 5 dph. Briefly, after injection with a mixture of sgRNA (crhr1 and/or crhr2) and cas9, the embryos were placed in a 70 mm Petri dish with embryo rearing medium (25 ml) supplemented with cortisol or vehicle control (with the same volume of stock solvent: 4.53 μl ethanol, 0.018%). The medium was changed every day. Both groups were reared at HT. Finally, gDNA and RNA were extracted, as explained above, from each embryo for genotypic sex and HMA analysis, and RT-qPCR analysis, respectively.All values are presented as mean±s.e.m. Fold change and statistical analysis of RT-qPCR quantifications were performed using FgStatistics interface (http://sites.google.com/site/fgStatistics/), based on the Relative Expression Software Tool (REST) from Pfaffl et al. (2002). Immunohistochemistry quantification was analyzed by χ2-distribution and statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v20 program, using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. Differences in sex ratio were determined by hypothesis test for differences in two population proportions, Z-test. All differences were considered statistically significant when P<0.05.We thank Gabriela C. López (INTECH) for helping with histological and immunohistochemical preparations.

However, genetic and evolutionary mechanisms of indels remain elusive. We establish a comparative genome-transcriptome-alignment approach for a large-scale identification of indels in Monopterus population. Over 2000 indels in 1738 indel genes, including 1–21 bp deletions and 1–15 bp insertions, were detected. Each indel gene had ∼1.1 deletions/insertions, and 2–4 alleles in population. Frequencies of deletions were prominently higher than those of insertions on both genome and population levels. Most of the indels led to in frame mutations with multiples of three and majorly occurred in non-domain regions, indicating functional constraint or tolerance of the indels. All indel genes showed higher expression levels than non-indel genes during sex reversal. Slide window analysis of global expression levels in gonads showed a significant positive correlation with indel density in the genome. Moreover, indel genes were evolutionarily conserved and evolved slowly compared to non-indel genes. Notably, population genetic structure of indels revealed divergent evolution of Monopterus population, as bottleneck effect of biogeographic isolation by Taiwan Strait, China.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

We first found that the photoreceptor genes responsible for receiving red, green, and ultraviolet light were expressed in the eyes of medaka during the sex differentiation period. Second, we revealed that testes developed in 15.9% of genotypic females reared under green light irradiation. These female-to-male sex-reversed fish (i.e. neo-males) showed male-specific secondary sexual characteristics and produced motile sperm. Finally, progeny tests using the sperm of neo-males (XX) and eggs of normal females (XX) revealed that all F1 offspring were female, indicating for the first time in animals that irradiation with light of a specific wavelength can trigger sex reversal.Light is one of the important environmental factors for aquatic habitats. Whereas the physiological mechanism of the effects of light, i.e. photoperiod and intensity, in growth and reproduction has been studied in many animal taxa1,2, the knowledge on the effects of the wavelength, i.e. the color of lights, to physiological states of animals is limited. For example, in teleost fish, irradiation by green light stimulates somatic growth by upregulating melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)3,4. In addition to enhanced growth performance, positive effects on feeding behavior and stress relief have been reported in several fish species by irradiation with specific light wavelength5,6,7,8,9.In some fish species, environmental factors such as water temperature10,11, pH, rearing density and photoperiod12 affect genotype-dependent sex differentiation and induce sex-reversal13,14. The mechanism of masculinization by high water temperatures has been well studied. In juveniles of the Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) exposed to high water temperatures, overproduced cortisol, a stress marker in fish, directly suppresses the expression of the cyp19a1 gene, which codes for an estrogenic enzyme that converts androgen to estrogen and subsequently induces masculinization15. In addition to this stress-induced sex-reversal mechanism, it has recently been reported that masculinization caused by exposure to high water temperatures in the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) results from an increase in the cyp19a promoter methylation level in females, indicating that water temperature-induced masculinization involves DNA methylation-mediated control of aromatase gene expression16. Although the fundamental mechanism of environmental sex determination (ESD) by temperature has been studied at the molecular levels, nothing is known about the effects of specific light wavelengths on gonadal development and sex differentiation.Medaka (Oryzias latipes) is a small model fish with several desirable features, including a short generation time, small genome size, and the availability of an inbred strain, Hd-rRII1, showing genotypic sex-dependent body color17,18. Their sex determination system is male heterogametic (XY/XX). A sex determining gene named dmy/dmrt1bY (DM-domain gene on Y chromosome) has been identified on the Y chromosome19,20,21. In the Hd-rRII1 strain, body color is different in males and females. The allele R of the r locus (a sex-linked pigment gene) is located on the Y chromosome. In this strain, XrXr females have a white body color, whereas XrYR males have an orange-red body color21. Therefore, it is easy to detect sex-reversed fish by observation of phenotypic sex (i.e. sex of gonads and secondary sexual characteristics appearing on fins) and determination of genotypic sex (i.e. genomic PCR for the dmy gene and body color). In addition, medaka normally follow a strong genetic sex determination system that is not easily influenced by environmental factors22. However, the induction of sex-reversal by administration of sex-steroid hormone, exposure to high water temperature, and the regulation of primordial germ cell number has been demonstrated10,15,23,24,25,26,27. These reports suggest that artificial sex control is possible in this species. Therefore, we selected medaka for molecular genotypic analysis of sex-reversal induced by irradiation with specific light wavelengths.Rod and cone photoreceptor cells of the retina enable the detection of light and the initiation of visual signaling17. Cone photoreceptors become functional under the sufficient light condition and they are related to the color vision. The spectral range of detection is controlled by the selected expression of visual pigments differing in absorption spectra in cone photoreceptor cells. Cone opsins, which belong to the subfamily of G-protein-coupled transmembrane receptors and form wavelength-specific visual pigments together with retinal chromophores, play key roles in color discrimination and in the appropriate processing of post-receptor signals17,18,28. Fish possess many cone opsin gene orthologs responsible for photoreception, which have emerged though gene duplication and allow fishes to adapt to the various light conditions of the aquatic environment29. In the retinas of adult medaka, 8 cone opsin genes, such as ultraviolet (SWS1), blue (SWS2-A, SWS2-B), green (RH2-A, RH2-B, RH2-C), and red (LWS-A and LWS-B) are responsible for photoreception with retinal chromophores and have already been identified30. However, it has not been revealed which opsin genes are expressed in the eyes of medaka during the sex differentiation stage.In the present study, we first investigated opsin gene expression in the eyes of 3 day after hatched medaka embryos. To test whether irradiation of a specific wavelength could affect sex differentiation in medaka, newly hatched medaka embryos were reared under white and green light-emitting diodes (LED) for 3 months. The male-to-female and female-to-male sex reversal rates were studied by comparing the phenotypic sex with the genotypic sex. To confirm whether the sex-reversal was functional or not, a progeny test was conducted by artificial insemination, and the development and sex of F1 offspring were analyzed.All 8 opsin genes were expressed in the eyes at the adult stage, whereas only 5 opsin genes were expressed in the eyes at the 3 day after hatch (Fig. 1C). The ultraviolet opsin gene (SWS1), all three types of green opsin genes (RH2-A, RH2-B, RH2-C), and two type of two red opsin genes (LWS-A/LWS-B) were expressed in the eyes of 3 day after hatched medaka (Fig. 1C). In contrast, two types of blue opsin genes (SWS2-A and SWS2-B) were not expressed at the 3 day after hatch medaka (Fig. 1C).Rearing conditions and opsin gene expression of newly hatched medaka. (A) White LED shows two peaks at 451 and 581 nm. Green LED shows one peak at 518 nm. (B) Experimental schedule. White and green LED irradiations started from just after hatching (0 dph) to 60 dph. Fish were sampled at 60 dph for gonadal histology and genotyping. Progeny tests were conducted at 90 dph by artificial insemination. (C) RT-PCR analysis of 8 opsin genes and ef-1a in the eyes of 3 dph and adult medaka. The λmax values for each opsin protein are from Matsumoto et al. 200630.The experimental fish showed a high survival rate in each LED irradiation treatment (over 80%) at 60 dph. In both white and green LED treatment groups, dmy and dmrt1 genes were detected in all orange-red body colored individuals, while only the dmrt1 gene was detected in white body colored individuals by genomic DNA PCR (Fig. 2A,B), indicating that the body color represented the genotypic sex even if the fish were reared under green LED irradiation.Determination of genotypic and phenotypic sex by body color, genomic DNA PCR, and the secondary sexual characteristics of dorsal and anal fins. (A,B) Genotypes of white and orange-red body color of 60-dph Hd-rRII1 medaka reared under white LED (A) and green LED (B). A primer set designed for the conserved region of dmy, a sex determination gene on the Y chromosome, and dmrt1, an orthologue of dmy located on an autosome, were used for PCR analysis.

A deeply cut dorsal fin (arrow) and a parallelogram-shaped anal fin (dotted line) are secondary characteristics of males. (E) Genotypic female (white body color) showing secondary characteristics of males, i.e. a deeply cut dorsal fin (arrow) and a parallelogram-shaped anal fin (dotted line). (F–H) External observation of the gonads of green LED-irradiated medaka (C–E). Dotted lines show ovary (F) and testes (G,H). (I–K) Histological observation of gonads of green LED-treated medaka (C–E). Perinucleolar oocytes (arrows in I) in ovaries and spermatogenic cells (arrows in J) were observed. Spermatogenic cells (arrows) including spermatozoa (arrowheads) were observed in female-to-male sex-reversed medaka testes (K). Scale bars = 2 mm (C–H), 40 μm (I–K).In the green LED treatment group, all genotypic males (dmy+/−, orange-red body color) had spermatogenic testes and male-specific anal and dorsal fins (n = 40) (Fig. 2D,G,J, Table 1). Notably, the fish showed male-specific secondary sex characteristics, i.e. parallelogram-shaped anal fins and deeply cut dorsal fins, which were observed in 15.9% of genotypic females (dmy−/−, white body color, n = 7) (Fig. 2E). External and histological observation revealed that those fish possessed testes, spermatogenic germ cells and mature spermatozoa (Fig. 2H,K) (Supplementary Fig. 4). The other 84.1% of genotypic females (n = 37) possessed female-specific fin types, ovaries, and oocytes (Fig. 2C,F,I, Table 1). The appearance rate of sex-reversed fish under green LED treatment was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than under white LED treatment (Table 1). No sex-reversed fish was observed in the white LED irradiation group (n = 38, Table 1).Motile sperm was obtained from sex-reversed males (white body color, dmy−/−, male-specific fin types) (n = 2, Fig. 3A) (Supplementary Movie 1). The spermatozoa were morphologically indistinguishable from those of normal males (Fig. 3B). The density of spermatozoa of the sex-reversed males was approximately 50% lower than that of normal males (Fig. 3C). Genomic DNA PCR analysis revealed that the dmy gene was detected neither in sperm nor in the fins of sex-reversed males (Fig. 3D).Progeny test of sperm obtained from sex-reversed males.

(E) Genomic DNA PCR for F1 offspring obtained from sex-reversed males (n = 2) (lanes 1–9) using a primer set for dmy/dmrt1 genes. Fin clips of adult males and females were used for positive controls. DW, distilled water for negative control; MW, molecular weight marker. (F) Histological observation of a gonad of F1 offspring. Dotted line shows an ovary. Scale bars = 2 mm (A), 10 mm (B), 0.5 mm (F).To test whether sex-reversed males could show sexual behavior, each male (n = 2) was paired with normal females (n = 7) and reared in optimal spawning conditions for one month. However, no sexual behavior and spawning was observed. Therefore, we conducted artificial insemination using sperm stripped from sex-reversed males (dmy−/−) and eggs from normal females (dmy−/−). Genomic PCR analysis revealed that none of the F1 offspring analyzed (n = 18) possessed dmy (Fig. 3E). Gonadal histology revealed that all of the F1 offspring (n = 18) at 2-months-old possessed ovaries (Fig. 3F).In this study, we found that irradiation with green LED light during the sex differentiation period induced female-to-male sex-reversal production of fertile sperm in genotypic female, indicating for the first time in animals that irradiation of a specific wavelength can be a trigger for sex reversal.In the wild, the frequency of female-to-male sex-reversal in medaka is 0.98% in Japan (Northern and Southern populations), China, and West and East Korea31. The female-to-male sex-reversal rate of the Hd-rRII1 strain (15.9%) obtained in this study was much higher than that observed in wild populations. Spontaneous XX male were also reported in inbred strain medaka32. However, spontaneous XX male was not observed in this experiment. In addition, female-to-male sex-reversal induced by green LED irradiation was not observed in the commercially available orange-red variety (data not shown). It has been reported that, in high water temperature treatment, the female-to-male sex-reversal rate varies among strains (e.g. 50% in the HNI strain and 24% in the Hd-rRII1 strain)10. Therefore, differences of genetic and epigenetic background could influence sex reversal rates resulting from green LED irradiation. Further studies are needed to test whether UV and red light can affect gonadal differentiation, because the opsin genes responsible for photoreception of these wavelengths (SWS1 and LWS-A) were expressed in the eyes of 3 day after hatch medaka. Other factors of larval rearing conditions, such as the irradiation period and light intensity, need to be investigated to reveal the requirements for successful sex-reversal and obtain higher sex-reversal rates.In this study, irradiation of green LED light was tested based on the opsin gene expression profile in the eyes of 3 day after hatched medaka. However, photoreceptors exist not only in the retina, but also in the pineal gland and deep brain of medaka33. In Oncorhynchus masou, the saccus vasculosus, which is located in the deep brain, is known to express the rhodopsin family genes RH1, SWS1, LWS, and OPN4 and regulate photoperiod gonadal development2. Interestingly, in the jellyfish Clytia gregaria, it was revealed that the gonadal photoreceptor known as opsin 9 regulates gonadal development34. Thus, it could be that known and unknown photoreceptive organs influence sex differentiation in fish35. An important issue raised by this study is which photoreceptive organ that received the green light induced the female-to-male sex-reversal in medaka.The mechanism by which female-to-male sex reversal occurred via green light in medaka was not revealed in this study. According to our results, two hypotheses were proposed. In medaka, sex reversal can be induced by exposure to high water temperature10,15,23,24,35. The expression of the gr gene encoding a glucocorticoid receptor, a stress marker, is increased by exposure to high water temperature during the sex differentiation period15. Thus, it has been proposed that overproduction of glucocorticoid suppresses cyp19a, a key aromatase gene that converts androgen to estrogen and induces female-to-male sex-reversal15,35. One possibility is that the stress caused by a specific light wavelength induced elevated cortisol levels and consequently suppressed aromatase gene expression in our study. Another possibility is that the effect of cell death induced sex reversal via irradiation of a specific wavelength. In insects, the common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, house mosquito Culex pipiens molestus, confused flour beetle Tribolium confusum, and strawberry leaf beetle Galerucella grisescens are killed by irradiation with visible blue light36,37. These studies suggest that irradiation with blue light produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induces cell death. In normal gonadal development of medaka, genotypic females possess 5 times more germ cells at 10 dph than genotypic males23. The depletion of germ-cell numbers by RNA knockdown can induce female-to-male sex-reversal26,27, suggesting that the number of germ cells in embryonic gonads is a factor for phenotypic sex differentiation of medaka. Therefore, if excessive irradiation with a specific wavelength of light can produce ROS, it might suppress germ cell division and induce female-to-male sex-reversal.In many species of cultured finfish, females exhibit higher growth rates than males and attain larger sizes, because the males are often sexually mature before reaching marketable size and show retarded growth rates. For example, Paralichthys olivaceus and Nibea albiflora females grow faster than males38,39. In the sturgeon family, their eggs (i.e. caviar) have high value in the market40,41. Therefore, sex manipulation of fish and monosex culture of females is desirable for commercial operations42,43,44. In the case of male heterogametic species, gynogenesis followed by androgenic hormonal sex reversal of females into males theoretically allows for the production of 100% sex-reversed XX males45,46. Conventional techniques for practical sex-reversal are the treatment of sexually undifferentiated fry by offering feed treated with or immersion with hormones or hormone analogues, which has been shown to work well under carefully controlled conditions in a wide range of species47. However, excessive doses of some hormones can lead to sterility or abnormal gonadal development. In addition, concerns persist over the safety of commercial sex reversal treatments both with regard to the safety of the farmer and of the consumer together with possible environmental impacts. If irradiation with a specific wavelength of light could induce neo-males in other aquaculture target species, we can expect the establishment of a new sex manipulation system that is safer and less costly than using sex hormones.The HdrR-II1 (Strain ID: IB178) inbred strain of medaka, supplied by NBRP Medaka (https://shigen.nig.ac.jp/medaka/), was used for all experiments. The animal experiments in this study were approved by the Kagoshima university animal experiment committee and all experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals of Kagoshima university.Eight cone opsin genes, LWS-A/LWS-B, RH2-A, RH2-B, RH2-C, SWS1, SWS2-A, and SWS2-B, have been reported in medaka30. The expression of opsin genes in the eyes of newly hatched embryo medaka (3 days post-hatching, dph) of the Hd-rRII1 inbred strain was analyzed by RT-PCR. Each opsin gene primer was from Matsumoto et al.30 and Chinen et al.48. LWS-A and LWS-B genes were highly similar coding30,49. Therefore, we used only LWS-A primer set. The total RNA was extracted from the eyes after homogenization in a 1.5-ml tube with 1000-μl Tri Reagent (Cosmo Bio Co., Ltd. Japan) following the manufacturer’s instructions. A ReverTra Ace kit (ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix with gDNA Remover; Toyobo Co., Ltd. Japan) was used for cDNA synthesis, and BIOTAQ DNA polymerase (Bioline Ltd. United Kingdom) was used for RT-PCR. PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 30 sec, then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 sec, 55 °C for 30 sec, 72 °C for 1 min, and 80 °C for 8 sec.The fish were reared under each color of LED (LDA6-G and LB1526G, Beamtec Co., Ltd. Saitama, Japan) in rectangular parallelepiped glass tanks (31.5 × 18.5 × 24.4 cm) covered by shielding curtains. The distance from the water surface to the light was approximately 5 cm. The light wavelength peaks were predetermined by an illuminance spectrophotometer (CL-500A; Konica Minolta, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and were 450 nm for the white LED and 518 nm for the green LED (Fig. 1A). The photoperiod in the rearing term was controlled at 14-h light and 10-h dark, and water temperate was maintained at 26 ± 5 °C. The formula food (Kyorin Co., LTD, Hyogo, Japan) and Artemia nauplii hatched from commercialized eggs (Brine Shrimp EGGS-90, Kitamura co., ltd, Kyoto, Japan) were fed to fish from newly hatched to adult. Each LED was used to irradiate fish tanks from 0 to 60 dph. Progeny tests were performed at 90 dph (Fig. 1B).The genotypic sex of medaka was determined by genomic DNA PCR for the dmy gene and the observation of body color. A 25-mm2 sample of caudal fin was dissolved in 500 μl of cell lysis regent (100 mM Tris-Cl, 5 mM EDTA, 200 mM NaCl, 0.2% SDS, 1 μl Proteinase K) at 55 °C for 12 h in an incubator. After 10 min of centrifugation at 13,000 × g, the supernatant was mixed with 500 μl of isopropanol, and the precipitant was washed with 70% alcohol. The genomic DNA was eluted with TE buffer. The genomic DNA PCR primers were from Matsuda et al.20. One primer set can detect two genes that are dmy (1000 bp) and dmrt1 (1400 bp). Because dmy only exists in males and dmrt1 exists in both sexes, genotypic males show two bands and genotypic females show one band by genomic DNA PCR. BIOTAQ DNA polymerase was used for genomic DNA PCR. PCR conditions were as follows: 96 °C for preheating and 94 °C for 2 min, then 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 7 min. In the Hd-rRII1 strain, genotypic males and females show orange-red and white body color, respectively. Therefore, body color was used to discriminate the genotypic sex of this inbred strain. As an internal control, the ef-1α primer set was used according to Nakamoto et al.50.The phenotypic sex was determined with gonadal histology and observation of shapes of dorsal and anal fins. The shapes of the anal and dorsal fins represent the secondary sex characteristics of medaka51. Phenotypic females show round and short anal fins (Fig. 2C), but phenotypic males show sharp and long anal fins (Fig. 2D). In addition, the dorsal fins of phenotypic males are deeply cut (inset of Fig. 2D), but those of phenotypic females are uncut (inset of Fig. 2C).The gonads were fixed in Bouin’s fixatives at 4 °C in a refrigerator. The fixed gonads were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol from 70% to 100% and cleared by xylene. In all processes, a shaker (Wave-SI; Taitec Co., Japan) was used. The gonads were embedded in paraffin and sectioned from 4 to 6 μm by a microtome (HM 315 S; MICROM international GmbH, Ltd. Germany). The sections were stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The sections were deparaffinized for 5 min in xylene and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol from 99% to 70%. The sections stained with hematoxylin for 2 min and eosin for 10 min were washed in tap water. Finally, the sections were stained with eosin and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol from 70% to 99% and mounted by cover glass with encapsulating material (Entellan New; Merck & Co., USA).The sperm was obtained from anesthetized sex-revered males and normal males. The spermatozoa were counted three times in each fish by a hemocytometer (Burker-Turk; Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC, USA).For artificial insemination, mature sex-reversed fish (HdrR-II1) and intact females (orange-red variety) were separately reared in glass tanks in spawning conditions as described above. The sperm were obtained from sex-reversed fish with abdominal pressure. The unfertilized eggs were obtained from anesthetized females. Those eggs and spermatozoa were mixed in wells of 6-well culture plates with artificial Iwamatsu’s seminal plasma (pH 7.3)52. The fertilized eggs were reared at 26 °C, and the obtained newly hatched embryos were reared for two months. The genotypic and phenotypic sex of the F1 offspring were determined as described above.Fisher’s exact test was used for the appearance rate of sex-reversed fish and the sex ratio of F1 offspring. T-tests were used for spermatozoa counts. All data were analyzed using the statistical analysis software Stat View 5.0) SAS Institute Inc. NC, USA).Nakane, Y. et al.

Male fish had female-like gene expression pattern after exposure to EE2 during gonadal differentiation.

Novel pathways included FXR/RXR and LXR/RXR.Male fish had female-like gene expression pattern after exposure to EE2 during gonadal differentiation.Exposures affected steroidogenesis, steroid receptor signaling and steroid metabolism pathways.Novel pathways included FXR/RXR and LXR/RXR.Estrogenic contaminants released into water bodies are potentially affecting the reproduction of aquatic organisms. Exposure to 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), a synthetic estrogen agonist commonly found in sewage effluents, has been shown to cause gonadal changes in male gonochoristic fish ranging from gonadal intersex to complete sex reversal. Although these gonadal changes have been well studied in Japanese medaka Oryzias latipes, the molecular mechanisms behind them are poorly understood. Our objective was to study the signaling pathways elicited by exposure to different concentrations of EE2 in this species. Embryos and larvae were sexed by the presence of leucophores and dmy expression (only in males). Male medaka were exposed to two EE2 concentrations (30 and 300 ng/L) during their gonadal differentiation period (7–22 dpf). The transcriptome of larvae was analyzed using RNA sequencing followed by pathway analysis. Genes involved in sex differentiation and gonadal development (e.g., cldn19, ctbp1, hsd17b4) showed a female-like expression pattern in EE2-exposed males with some genes changing in expression in an EE2 concentration-dependent manner. However, not all genes known to be involved in sex differentiation and gonadal development (e.g., wnt4b) were altered by EE2. Several of the prominently affected signaling pathways involved genes associated with steroidogenesis, steroid receptor signaling and steroid metabolism, such as cyp2b3, cyp3b40, cyp1a, hsd17b4. We also report on novel genes and pathways affected that might play a role in gonadal changes, including several genes associated with FXR/RXR and LXR/RXR activation networks. This study is the first to examine the transcriptomic changes in male fish resulting from exposure to EE2 during the gonadal differentiation period, providing new insights on the signaling pathways involved in the development of gonadal changes in gonochoristic fish.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Non-reproductive behavior was analyzed in fish developmentally exposed to EE2.
•
Behavior and sex ratio were altered in exposed fish after remediation.
•
Induction of intersex in males was induced by 30 ng/L but not by 5 ng/L.Non-reproductive behavior was analyzed in fish developmentally exposed to EE2.Behavior and sex ratio were altered in exposed fish after remediation.Induction of intersex in males was induced by 30 ng/L but not by 5 ng/L.The synthetic estrogen 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and commonly detected in sewage effluents, interferes with the endocrine system in multiple ways. Exposure during sensitive windows of development causes persistent effects on fertility, reproductive and non-reproductive behavior in mammals and fish. In the present study, three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were exposed to nominal 0 and 20 ng/L EE2 from fertilization to 7 weeks post-hatch. After 8 months of remediation in clean water three non-reproductive behaviors, not previously analyzed in developmentally EE2-exposed progeny of wild-caught fish, were evaluated. Chemical analysis revealed that the nominal 0 and 20 ng/L exposure contained 5 and 30 ng/L EE2, respectively. Therefore, the use of control fish from previous experiments was necessary for comparisons. Fish exposed during development showed significant concentration-dependent reduction in anxiety-like behavior in the scototaxis (light/dark preference) test by means of shorter latency to first entrance to the white compartment, more visits in white, and longer total time in white compared to unexposed fish. In the novel tank test, developmental exposure significantly increased the number of transitions to the upper half of the aquaria. Exposure to EE2 during development did not alter shoal cohesion in the shoaling test compared with unexposed fish but fish exposed to 30 ng/L EE2 had significantly longer latency to leave the shoal and fewer transitions away from the shoal compared to fish exposed to 5 ng/L EE2. Skewed sex ratio with more females, sex reversal in genetic males as well as intersex in males was observed after exposure to 30, but not 5 ng/L EE2. In conclusion, EE2 exposure during development in three-spined stickleback resulted in persistent effects on anxiety-like behaviors. These long-term effects from developmental exposure are likely to be of higher relevance for natural populations than are short-term effects from adult exposure.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Genes involved in sex differentiation, such as dmrt1, sox9 and fem1, were characterized.Sexual dimorphism of male and female seahorses was studied through transcriptome comparison.176 up-regulated transcripts were identified in male seahorses.Genes involved in sex differentiation, such as dmrt1, sox9 and fem1, were characterized.Seahorse is characterized by its male pregnancy and sex-role reversal. To better understand the sexual dimorphism of male and female seahorses based on essential genes, we performed systematic transcriptome studies for both genders. A total of 157,834,590 cleaned reads were obtained and assembled into 129,268 transcripts and 31,764 could be annotated. Results showed that 176 up-regulated and 391 down-regulated transcripts were identified in the male seahorses compared with those in females. Genes involved in sex differentiation, such as dmrt1, sox9, fem1 and vasa, were identified and characterized.

A novel splice variant of GnRH2 was discovered in the gonad of the rice field eel.
•
GnRH2 expression increased significantly during the late stage of sex reversal.
•
GnRH2-SV expression increased initially, and remained elevated during sex reversal.

GAP2 and New GAP2 elevated gonadal differentiation-related genes and serum 11-KT.A novel splice variant of GnRH2 was discovered in the gonad of the rice field eel.GnRH2 expression increased significantly during the late stage of sex reversal.GnRH2-SV expression increased initially, and remained elevated during sex reversal.GAP2 and New GAP2 elevated gonadal differentiation-related genes and serum 11-KT.The rice field eel, Monopterus albus, is a protogynous hermaphrodite fish, in which the gonads are initially female ovaries which then transform into male testes. The exact mechanisms governing sex reversal in the rice field eel are unknown. In this study, a novel alternative splicing variant of GnRH2 (GnRH2-SV), retaining the second intron, was discovered in the gonad of the rice field eel. Compared to GnRH2, GnRH2-SV may give rise to a novel truncated GnRH2-associated peptide (New GAP2). The normal transcript of GnRH2 was primarily expressed in the brain, and could also be detected in the liver, spleen, ovary, and testis. However, GnRH2-SV was only expressed in the ovary and testis. During sex reversal, GnRH2 expression levels increased significantly at late stages; however, expression levels of GnRH2-SV were lower in ovary than in ovotestis and testis. We also examined the effect of three peptides (GnRHa, GAP2, and New GAP2) on gonadal sex differentiation during the third stage of ovarian development of the rice field eel. Compared to the control group, the expression of amh increased significantly following incubation with each of the three peptides. However, only New GAP2 stimulated the expression of sox9a1 mRNA in vitro. After intraperitoneal injection of GAP2, the expression of amh, foxl2, and cyp19a1a increased significantly after 12 h; the concentration of serum 11-KT was also significantly increased at the 12 h time point. Treatment with New GAP2 significantly increased the expression of amh, dmrt1a, and sox9a1, and also increased the concentration of serum 11-KT. After treated with GnRHa, the expression of amh, dmrt1a, sox9a1, cyp19a1a, and foxl2 increased significantly, as did the level of serum E2. These results indicated that both GAP2 and New GAP2 play a crucial role in inducing expression changes of sex-differentiation related genes, and may be involved in the gonadal development and sex reversal in the rice field eel.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

 16, Article number: 16 (2018) Cite this article3104 Accesses11 Citations16 AltmetricMetricsSex determination relies on a hierarchically structured network of genes, and is one of the most plastic processes in evolution. The evolution of sex-determining genes within a network, by neo- or sub-functionalization, also requires the regulatory landscape to be rewired to accommodate these novel gene functions. We previously showed that in medaka fish, the regulatory landscape of the master male-determining gene dmrt1bY underwent a profound rearrangement, concomitantly with acquiring a dominant position within the sex-determining network. This rewiring was brought about by the exaptation of a transposable element (TE) called Izanagi, which is co-opted to act as a silencer to turn off the dmrt1bY gene after it performed its function in sex determination.We now show that a second TE, Rex1, has been incorporated into Izanagi. The insertion of Rex1 brought in a preformed regulatory element for the transcription factor Sox5, which here functions in establishing the temporal and cell-type-specific expression pattern of dmrt1bY. Mutant analysis demonstrates the importance of Sox5 in the gonadal development of medaka, and possibly in mice, in a dmrt1bY-independent manner. Moreover, Sox5 medaka mutants have complete female-to-male sex reversal.Our work reveals an unexpected complexity in TE-mediated transcriptional rewiring, with the exaptation of a second TE into a network already rewired by a TE. We also show a dual role for Sox5 during sex determination: first, as an evolutionarily conserved regulator of germ-cell number in medaka, and second, by de novo regulation of dmrt1 transcriptional activity during primary sex determination due to exaptation of the Rex1 transposable element.Sex determination (SD) is one of the most plastic processes in evolution. The trigger for the bipotential undifferentiated embryonic gonad anlage to develop into either testis or ovary can be provided by various signals from the environment, the genetic constitution of the individual, or a mixture of both [1, 2]. Studies of the modes of genetic SD revealed that the genes at the top of the regulatory network and the genes of the network itself are subject to rapid changes in evolution. New master SD genes evolved repeatedly and independently [3]. This situation is particularly obvious in fish, since closely related sister species can have different genetic SD systems or master SD genes [3,4,5,6,7].Clearly, such a high turnover of genetic determinants can work only if the evolutionary innovations are accompanied by the ability of the respective genes to neo-functionalize or sub-functionalize quickly and efficiently [8, 9]. In addition to changes in protein structure, differences in gene regulation have an important role in evolution and are considered a quick and effective way to adapt gene functions to novelty [10,11,12]. Hence, the necessity for the transcriptional rewiring of the architecture of the SD regulatory network and connecting novel master SD genes to it requires high-capacity and fast mechanisms. Such a mechanism was proposed by Britten and Davidson almost 50 years ago [13, 14]. They hypothesized that transposable elements (TEs) carry preformed transcription factor binding sites, which, after mobilization and insertion into novel locations of the genome, would contribute novel regulatory features to nearby genes through these motifs. However, examples of authentic co-option, or exaptation [15], of TEs, where most or all gene transcriptions initiate within a TE, remain sparse (see [16] for a review).Intriguingly, of the handful of examples of this process, one of the best documented comes from a novel SD gene. The master male-determining gene dmrt1bY of the teleost fish Oryzias latipes (medaka) arose approximately 5 to 10 million years ago from an autosome encompassing the dmrt1 gene. Dmrt1 is a highly conserved transcription factor that usually functions at a downstream position of the sexual regulatory cascade. In medaka, the dmrt1 gene was locally duplicated and inserted into another chromosome that became the Y-chromosome [5]. To exert its novel function at its new upstream position, dmrt1bY acquired a divergent expression pattern and effector gene profile compared to its autosomal ancestor, dmrt1a [5, 17]. We previously showed that this evolutionary innovation, which required a complete rewiring of the regulatory network, was partly brought about by exaptation of a ready-to-use pre-existing cis-regulatory element contributed by a TE, called Izanagi [17]. This element acts as a silencer. It recruits proteins Dmrt1bY and Dmrt1a to turn off the dmrt1bY gene after it has fulfilled its function as the primary male SD gene.We report here that TE-mediated transcriptional rewiring can reach an unexpected level of complexity that exceeds this simple feedback regulation. We find that another TE, Rex1, has jumped into Izanagi. Through the disruption of Izanagi, Rex1 immobilized this TE and fixed the Dmrt1-mediated downregulation. Moreover, Rex1 brought in a preformed regulatory element for the transcription factor Sox5. We show that medaka Sox5 binds to the sox5-responsive elements of the dmrt1bY promoter and downregulates its transcriptional activity. Interestingly, in vivo analysis of double transgenic fluorescent reporter fish additionally revealed a complementary pattern of expression of both genes. The higher expression of sox5 correlates with a lower expression of dmrt1bY and vice versa. Our results underpin the importance of the Rex1 TE for the establishment of a new SD mechanism in medaka and likely contribute in establishing the temporal and cell-type specific expression pattern of dmrt1bY.Several transcription factors of the Sox family (Sox3, SRY, Sox 9, and sox8) play crucial roles in SD, but Sox5 has not been previously implicated in SD in any metazoan so far (neither Sox5 in vertebrates, nor its Drosophila homologue Sox102F). Interestingly, in medaka, disruption of sox5 leads to XX female-to-male sex reversal. From an analysis of mutants, we find the critical involvement in gonadal development in medaka by regulating primordial germ cells (PGCs). In overexpression experiments, there is an ectopic induction of germ-cell markers including dmrt1. With all necessary notes of caution, our preliminary expression pattern data, also detecting SOX5 expression in the fetal gonad of mice, may indicate an evolutionarily conserved role for SOX5 during early mammalian gonad development.Our work reveals a dual role for sox5 during SD: (i) first being an evolutionarily conserved important regulator of germ-cell number in medaka and possibly beyond and (ii) second, de novo regulation of medaka dmrt1 transcriptional activity during primary SD after it has been recruited for transcriptional rewiring of the dmrt1 promoter due to exaptation of a TE.In an initial analysis of the promoter of the medaka male-determining gene dmrt1bY, we found that after duplication from its autosomal progenitor dmrt1a, an insertion of an Izanagi DNA transposon brought in a novel transcriptional repressor element [17]. It functions by binding Dmrt1a and Dmrt1bY transcription factors and is essential for the downregulation of dmrt1bY after fulfilling its SD function in the male gonad.In addition to this repressor element [17], the promoter region contains an unexpectedly high density of putative binding sites for Sox5 (see the [β] region in Fig. 1a and [17]). It harbors seven Sox5 binding sites; a random prediction would expect only 0.46 sites over the whole sequence. Interestingly, a unique putative Sox5 binding site is also found within a Rex1 TE [α], and two within repeat 3 [γ] of the dmrt1bY proximal promoter region (see [α], [β], or [γ] in Fig. 1a and Additional file 1: Figure S1 for sox5 binding site locations). These regions were all inserted into the promoter after the duplication event and, thus, during the evolution of the novel male-determining function of dmrt1bY.Comparative analysis of the dmrt1a and dmrt1bY co-ortholog promoters and presence of Rex1 element sequences in the genomes of selected fish species. a Comparative analysis of the medaka dmrt1 co-ortholog promoter regions. Differences in length for the two promoter regions are caused by Rex1 and Izanagi transposable elements as well as repeats 3 and 4 that were inserted into the dmrt1bY promoter after the duplication event that gave rise to the dmrt1bY gene approximately 10 million years ago [17]. Regions α, β, or γ (brackets [] underlined in red) contain multiple Sox5 binding sites within Rex1, Izanagi, and repeat 3, respectively, that have been subjected to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) (see also Additional file 1: Figure S1). The red star (*) identifies the Dmrt1 binding site described in [17]. b Alignment of the Y-chromosomal Rex1 element together with the 19 remaining Rex1 copies encompassing the sox5 binding site in the medaka genome. Dots indicate conserved nucleotides. Black arrows define primers used for chromatin immunoprecipitation. c Presence of Rex1 element (i) partial sequences, (ii) sequences encompassing the dmrt1bY-nested sox5 binding site, and (iii) sequences encompassing the dmrt1bY-nested sox5 binding site with the intact sox5 binding site in the genomes of medaka (Oryzias latipes), tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), zebrafish (Danio rerio), cavefish (Astyanax mexicanus), cod (Gadus morhua), gar (Lepisosteus oculatus), stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), platy (Xiphophorus maculatus), Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa), fugu, tetraodon, and coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae)In particular, the Sox5 binding site nested within the Rex1 TE of the dmrt1bY proximal active promoter showed high prediction probability (weight 9.4, p value 5.4 × 10-5, lnPval -9;831; [α] in Fig. 1a, see also “Methods” for the positional weight matrix employed). To address the question whether this Sox5 binding site has evolved de novo after insertion or was already an integral part of the Rex1 element that was inserted into the dmrt1bY promoter, we blasted the Rex1 sequence of the dmrt1bY promoter against the medaka and other fish genomes (Fig. 1b,c). Rex1 elements are present in 100 copies in the genome of medaka. Many copies are also found in tilapia (100) and zebrafish (59), but there are fewer in cavefish (20), cod (15) and gar (10). They are scarce in stickleback (3), platyfish (4), and Amazon molly (2), and absent in fugu, tetraodon, and coelacanth (Fig. 1c). Interestingly, among Rex1 elements, the region encompassing the predicted sox5-binding site is very poorly conserved despite being part of the reverse transcriptase-coding region (region 6) of the Rex1 element (Additional file 2: Figure S2). It can be detected with some divergence to the consensus sequence in only 47, 20, 10, 5, 2, and 1 copies in tilapia, medaka, zebrafish, cavefish, cod, and Amazon molly, respectively (Fig. 1c). An intact sox5 binding site is predicted in only two species. In tilapia, a single copy has a high-fidelity site, whereas 20 copies in medaka, including the one in the dmrt1bY promoter, have putatively intact sox5 binding sites (Fig. 1b,c and Additional file 3: Table S1). Hence, Rex1-nested sox5 binding sites appear to be a medaka-specific feature.Sox5 has been correlated with dmrt1 expression in zebrafish [18] and the wrasse, Halichoeres tenuispinis [19], in in vitro promoter studies. Thus, we hypothesized that the identified sox5 binding sites could be involved in the transcriptional rewiring of dmrt1bY.To assess the relevance of the predicted Sox5 binding sites [α], [β], and [γ] (see Fig. 1a,b) in the dmrt1bY promoter, two different medaka cell lines, Oryzias latipes spermatogonial (Sg3) and fibroblast (OLF) cells, were transfected with a FLAG-tagged version of Sox5 and then subjected to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using an anti-FLAG antibody. DNA amplification with specific sets of primers from the Sox5 immunoprecipitates revealed that the Sox5 protein binds to the predicted sites ([α], [β], and [γ]) of the dmrt1bY promoter. However, much stronger binding is apparent for the proximal site [α] (up to tenfold higher enrichment, Fig. 2a) located within the Rex1 element. Of note, although two DNA-binding sequences for Sox5 were predicted within the dmrt1a proximal promoter (at positions [-286/-300] and [-1100/-1116] upstream of the ATG), they do not appear to be functional, as Sox5 does not target them in the ChIP experiments (data not shown).Analysis of Sox5 binding to the dmrt1bY promoter and regulation of dmrt1bY promoter activity upon modulation of Sox5 expression. a Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of Sox5 binding to regions α, β, or γ of the dmrt1bY proximal promoter. Transient transfection of a flagged and tagged version of Sox5 into either medaka spermatogonial or fibroblast cell lines and subsequent immunoprecipitation (FLAG antibody) followed by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results are presented as enrichment compared to the input and correspond to three independent immunoprecipitations for each region (α, β, or γ). Statistical significance was assessed with the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test (N = 3). b1–b4 Analysis of dmrt1bY proximal promoter activity after Sox5 transient transfection into the medaka spermatogonial cell line (Sg3). Deletions of the 5′ dmrt1bY promoter were generated: b1 α region, b2 α and β regions, b3, b4 α, β, and γ regions. Transcriptional activity was quantified in the absence (control, -Sox5) or presence (+Sox5) of Sox5. Statistical significance was assessed with the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test (N = 4). c Detailed analysis of the transcriptional activity of the alpha (α), alpha-mutant (α-MUT), and beta (β) fragments. Statistical significance was assessed with the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test (N = 4). * p value ≤ 0.05, ** p value ≤ 0.01. ns non-significant, OLF Oryzias latipes fibroblast, Sg3 Oryzias latipes spermatogonial cellOf note, the predicted sox5 binding region [β] has previously been shown to overlap with a high affinity binding site for Dmrt1 [17]. Hence, competition between Sox5 and Dmrt1 for access to this sequence motif cannot be excluded. If Dmrt1 already occupies the motif, this might explain the low amount of recovery in the Sox5 ChIP experiment.Next, we examined (i) the respective contributions of each part of the promoter for dmrt1bY transcriptional regulation and (ii) the direction of that regulation (up- or downregulation) using transcriptional reporter assays. Thus, 5′ deletions of the dmrt1bY promoter ([0/-1593], [0/-2995], [0/-6207], and [0/-8996]) were produced and analyzed after transient transfection for their ability to drive luciferase expression (Fig. 2b).In the medaka spermatogonial cell line, the highest promoter activity was detectable for the [0/-2995] proximal promoter region encompassing sites [α] and [β] (Fig. 2b2). Promoter activity was significantly lower (Fig. 2b3,4), when more distal sequences ([-2996/-6207]) containing site [γ] were present in the construct. The shortest proximal promoter region (encompassing site [α] only) had intermediate transcriptional activity (Fig. 2b1). Interestingly, the transcriptional activity of the most proximal parts of the dmrt1bY promoter—encompassing the sites [α] in Rex1 (Fig. 2b1) and [β] in Izanagi (Fig. 2b2)—was reduced by between 43% and 68% when Sox5 was overexpressed (Fig. 2b1,2). This effect of Sox5 overexpression was not apparent for the longer constructs including further distal sequences displaying strong constitutive repression (Fig. 2b3,4). Of note, the highest repression of dmrt1bY promoter transcriptional activity was observed for the proximal promoter region encompassing the [α] site in Rex1 (68% in Fig. 2b1). Next, modulation of transcriptional activity was tested for the [α], [α]-MUT, and [β] regions alone (Fig. 2c). Interestingly, only the [α] region was able to downregulate promoter activity (by about 40%) when fused to a minimal thymidine kinase promoter. Neither the [β] or a mutated version of the [α] region ([α]-MUT) were able to modulate the activity of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter (Fig. 2c).To obtain a more precise readout for the regulation of medaka dmrt1bY expression by Sox5, spermatogonial and fibroblast medaka cell lines were transiently transfected with a Sox5-expressing construct and endogenous dmrt1bY expression was quantified by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at different time points post-transfection (24, 48, and 72 h). Our findings reveal that the transcription of dmrt1bY is highly repressed in the presence of Sox5 (up to 90% 48 h after transfection, Fig. 3a) in both the OLF and Sg3 medaka cell lines.Effects of Sox5 modulation on dmrt1bY gene expression. Analysis of dmrtbY a transcriptional regulation after sox5 transient transfection in either spermatogonial or fibroblast medaka cell lines at 24 or 48 h post-transfection. Dataset results of four independent transfections. Statistical significance was assessed with the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test (N = 4; * p value ≤ 0.05, ** p value ≤ 0.01). b Overexpression of sox5 was stimulated in fish eggs. The expression of dmrt1bY and germ-cell markers (nanos2, nanos3, dead-end, vasa, tra2a, and piwi) were monitored at stage 18 of development and compared to wild-type fish embryos. Dataset results of three independent transfections. Statistical significance was assessed with the t-test (N = 3 and each replicate is a pool of 25 eggs; * p value ≤ 0.05, ** p value ≤ 0.01). ns non-significant, OLF Oryzias latipes fibroblast, Sg3 Oryzias latipes spermatogonial cellNext, to validate our in vitro results, Sox5 coding mRNAs were microinjected into one-cell-stage embryos, and the expression of dmrt1bY and several germ-cell markers (nanos2, nanos3, dead-end, vasa, tra2a, and piwi) was monitored (Fig. 3b). The results confirm the transient cell transfection experiments and demonstrated that in vivo Sox5 can act as a negative modulator of dmrt1bY expression (Fig. 3b). Overexpression of Sox5 also resulted in the repression of all analyzed germ-cell genes regardless of their intrinsic endogenous expression levels (Fig. 3b). Our in vivo results identify Sox5 as a strong negative regulator of germ-cell gene expression, including dmrt1bY. Interestingly, although most of the germ-cell marker genes (nanos3, dead-end, vasa, and piwi) are maternally deposited, their lower relative abundances compared to controls after Sox5 overexpression are likely attributable to a total arrest of background transcription after zygotic transcription started, or possibly accelerated mRNA decay.Medaka sox5 mRNA, which is expressed in embryonic and early larval development, has a distinct spatially and temporarily restricted expression pattern (Fig. 4). Between stages 18 and 22, sox5 transcripts localize mainly in the head and tail bud regions of the embryos (Fig. 4a–d). At stage 22, expression is additionally detected in the lateral plate mesoderm (arrowheads in Fig. 4c,d), from which the somatic gonadal primordium will develop shortly thereafter [20]. Later, sox5 expression is observed over the entire dorsal neural tube (Fig. 4e,e',f,f') and pre-migratory neural crest cells (NCCs, Fig. 4f'). At stage 29, sox5 transcripts are present in migrating NCCs ventrally [21] (Fig. 4g and arrowheads in g'). A higher resolution of the dynamic expression pattern of sox5 in vivo was obtained with a transgenic line, which has the 3288-bp upstream promoter region of sox5 fused to a fluorescent (mCherry) reporter. The reliability of sox5 gene expression was confirmed by comparison of the observed fluorescence with the in situ hybridization data (Fig. 4c and f' compared to d, h, and i, respectively). Sox5 promoter-driven fluorescence was detected as early as stage 22 in the lateral plate mesoderm (Fig. 4d). This region has been shown to have already the properties of a gonadal field because somatic gonadal precursors arise from the most posterior part of the lateral plate mesoderm [20]. Consistently, at stages 26/28, when the gonadal primordium just has formed, faint sox5 expression is still observable in the somatic tissues surrounding the germ cells that express Dmrt1bY (Fig. 5a–c).Expression of medaka sox5 during embryogenesis. a to c and e to g Medaka sox5 expression investigated by whole-mount in situ hybridization or d, h, and i fluorescence using a transgenic reporter line for which a 3288-bp sox5 promoter fragment drives the expression of mCherry. a-c Between stages 18 and 22, sox5 mRNA localizes predominantly in the head and tail bud regions of the embryos. c,d At stage 22, additional expression is detected in the lateral plate mesoderm of the embryos (arrows). e–g' From stage 24 onward, sox5 expression spans over the dorsal neural tube and pre-migratory neural crest cells (arrowheads). g,g' At stage 29, sox5 expression is also seen in ventral migrating neural crest cells (arrowheads). h and i Fluorescent sox5 expression is monitored in the neural tube and neural crest cells of hatching embryos (stages 38/39). h For comparison, patched2 highlights the notochord at stage 39 [11]Comparative analysis of sox5 and dmrt1bY expression dynamics during gonadal primordium formation. Expression of sox5 compared to dmrt1by in a double transgenic fluorescent reporter line. a–c During early gonadal formation, sox5 is first detected in the somatic tissues surrounding the germ cells at stages 26 to 28. At the same time, dmrt1bY is expressed in germ cells. d–i By stages 33 to 34, sox5 expression becomes restricted to the germ cells. dmrt1bY is also expressed in the germ cells at those specific stages of development. Variations within the respective levels of sox5 and dmrt1bY expression are clearly observable (d compared to e and f and g compared to h and i). j,k Around hatching (stages 38/39), the expression of sox5 strengthens in all germ cells while parallel dmrt1bY expression quickly switches from germ cells only to somatic germ-cell-surrounding cells only. l In vivo visualization of the dynamics of expression localization of sox5 and dmrt1bY during male gonadal primordium development. The expression of sox5 and dmrt1bY is highly dynamic during primordium gonadal formation, switching from somatic to germ cells and vice versa, respectively, from stage 26 until hatching. Being mutual repressors of each other, a seesaw of expression is observed, finally finely restricting dmrt1bY expression in the somatic part of the primordium gonad. Blue and red represent cellular expression localizations only and should not been interpreted as expression levelsAt stages 33 to 34, the gonadal expression of sox5 is restricted to the germ cells (Fig. 5d–i). Of note, variations in the levels of sox5 expression are clearly visible between different germ cells (Fig. 5d,e). Interestingly, dmrt1bY (Dmrt1bY:GFP) is also expressed in germ cells at that specific stage of development [22] and displays variations in expression between individual germ cells [23, 24] (Fig. 5d,f). Analysis of the [Sox5:mCherry and Dmrt1bY:GFP] double transgenic line revealed a complementary pattern of expression of both genes: those germ cells that have a higher expression of sox5 have a lower expression of dmrt1bY and vice versa (Fig. 5d–i).During the following developmental stages (stages 38/39), the expression of sox5:mCherry increases in all germ cells, whereas dmrt1bY:GFP concurrently switches from germ cells to the somatic, germ-cell-surrounding cells (Fig. 5j,k). Taken together, these results show that expression of sox5 and dmrt1bY is highly dynamic during gonadal primordium formation, switching from germ cells to somatic cells (Fig. 5l).To determine whether the expression of sox5 during early gonadal development is a medaka-specific feature or is more widely conserved, we used immunofluorescence on 13.5 and 14.5 days post coitum (dpc) mouse embryos. This revealed that SOX5 was expressed in peritubular myoid cells surrounding cords in the fetal testis (Additional file 4: Figure S3, left and middle panels) and in a subset of somatic and germ cells in the fetal ovary (Additional file 4: Figure S3, right panels). Of note, a substantial fraction of SOX5 expression also displayed cytoplasmic localization. Although reported for other SOX factors (see SOX2 [25], SOX9 [26, 27], and [28] for reviews), the functional significance of the SOX5 non-exclusive nuclear localization in mice gonads remains to be investigated.Given reduced dmrt1bY expression in the fully developed testis [29], we also monitored the expression of sox5 in fully mature gonads of both sexes (Fig. 6). In adult testes, sox5 fluorescence was mainly restricted to the interlobular cells (see Fig. 6a–d). In contrast, dmrt1bY expression is clearly localized within the Sertoli cells [17] of the testicular lobules (Fig. 6a). No co-localization of dmrt1bY and sox5 transcripts whatsoever was observed (Fig. 6a). To define the nature of the interlobular sox5-positive cells better, immunofluorescence of 11-β-hydroxylase protein, a specific marker of Leydig cells, was performed (Fig. 6b). Interstitial cells of Leydig are found adjacent to the seminiferous lobules in the testes and produce androgens [30]. A perfect co-localization of sox5 transcripts and 11-β-hydroxylase protein confirmed that the interlobular sox5-positive cells are indeed Leydig cells (Fig. 6c,d). Interestingly, another discrete population of sox5-positive cells is discernable between but close to the lobules (Fig. 6e–g). These cells are very small compared to their neighboring germ cells, and their nuclei appear compact (Fig. 6h–j). The expression of the germ-cell marker vasa (Fig. 6e–j) assigns these cells to the germ-cell lineage, which are probably at a very early stage of differentiation. These germ cells do not express dmrt1bY (Fig. 6k–n). The adult ovary displays only a very few sox5-positive cells with small and condensed nuclei (Fig. 6o–q). At present, the identity of these cells is difficult to ascertain, but oocytes and somatic supporting cells (granulosa or theca cells) can be excluded from their morphology and location.Expression of sox5 in adult gonads. a–d In adult testes, sox5 fluorescence is restricted to the cells located between the lobules where the germ and Sertoli cells lie. a,b In double transgenic reporter fish, fluorescence of sox5 and dmrt1bY (marking the Sertoli cells) is distinct. c, d The interlobular expression of sox5 co-localizes with 11-β-hydroxylase, a marker of Leydig cells. e–j Expression of sox5 is also detected in another discrete population of cells between but always close to the germinal lobules. h-j Small in size, these sox5-positive cells also express vasa, a specific marker of germ cells. k–n The sox5- and vasa-positive cells do not express dmrt1bY. o–q In adult ovaries, only extremely few sox5 positive cells are detected.To obtain functional data on the role of sox5 in gonadal development, we next analyzed early gonadal development in mutants. The ml-3 mutant (N541S) is a naturally occurring mutation, for which a premature stop codon results in the production of a truncated Sox5 protein lacking the HMG box domain and causing Sox5 loss of function [21, 31, 32]. Considering that sox5 is first expressed in the lateral plate mesoderm and then in germ cells during primordial gonad formation, we investigated whether Sox5 plays a role in regulating PGC number. Whole-mount in situ hybridizations utilizing the PGC-specific marker vasa were performed in wild-type and sox5-/- mutant fish embryos (Fig. 7a,b). At stage 22, during the formation of the primordial gonad when sox5 has a first expression peak in wild-type embryos, a drastic reduction in the PGC number is evident in mutants (Fig. 7a compared to b). This emphasizes a possible role for Sox5 as being a regulator of PGC proliferation although such a reduction in PGC numbers might also be ascribed to reduced proliferation, reduced survival, or defects in fate specification.Regulation of PGC numbers by Sox5. a,b As early as stage 22, a drastic reduction of the germ-cell number (vasa in situ hybridization) is observed in sox5-/- mutants compared to wild-type embryos. c For conditional knock-in and rescue of the sox5-/- mutant fish, a transgenic line expressing sox5 was produced. See “Methods” for details. d,e In vivo visualization of the effective recombination and expression of sox5 is apparent after a switch from red cytoplasmic to green nuclear-localized fluorescence. After Cre recombinase injection at the one-cell stage, an almost total recombination is observed, leading to the expression of the sox5 transcript as monitored by green fluorescence. Stars indicate auto-fluorescent pigment cells and arrows indicate recombined germ cells. f Germ-cell numbers in sox5 mutant medaka after in vivo recombination and expression of sox5. Of note, for that specific experiment, embryos were additionally injected with a GFP-Nanos 3′ untranslated region (UTR) mRNA construct allowing effective PGC monitoring. Statistical significance was assessed with the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test (N = 30, 28, and 42 for Sox5-/-, Sox5-/- recombined, and wild-type embryos, respectively; * p value ≤ 0.05, ** p value ≤ 0.01). GFP green fluorescent protein, ns non-significant, PGC primordial germ cellGiven that absence of functional Sox5 expression in the sox5-/- mutant resulted in a reduced number of PGCs, we next attempted to rescue the gonadal phenotype by wild-type sox5 expression to show that this gene is crucial in regulating PGC numbers. Thus, we established a transgenic line that expresses sox5 after controlled homologous recombination in the sox5 mutant genetic background (Fig. 7c). In this line, the sox5 promoter drives the expression of a mCherry-stop cassette flanked by LoxP sites. This cassette is followed by the wild-type sox5 open reading frame (ORF) fused to a 2A self-cleaving system [33] with nuclear-addressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) (H2B-GFP) (Fig. 7c). After injection of mRNAs encoding for the Cre-NLS protein and effective recombination, the mCherry-stop cassette is excised, and the sox5 ORF is expressed together with nuclear-localized GFP (see recombination in Fig. 7d for the trunk and 7e for germ cells). We employed this system as being preferable to conventional overexpression because it allows us to bypass the deleterious effect of overexpressing the pleiotropic sox5 gene during early development. Using this system, we show that in terms of germ-cell numbers, a partial rescue of the Sox5-/- phenotype at stage 20 occurred in the sox5-/- mutant genetic background (Fig. 7f). This provides evidence that Sox5 is indeed required for controlling PGC numbers during the formation of the early gonadal primordium as early as stage 20.Since germ-cell number was reduced in the sox5-/- mutant fish, we further investigated whether sexual development was affected. Phenotypic and genotypic sex was determined in a sox5-/- mutant line [31, 34]. A complete XX female-to-male sex reversal (up to 95%) was recorded (Fig. 8a). The female-to-male sex-reversed phenotypic males were fully fertile, so this sox5-/- mutant line could be maintained exclusively on a XX genotypic background (see Fig. 8b for phenotypes). Genotypic XY sox5-/- mutant fish were never detected in the progeny (Fig. 8b) nor in outcrosses. The absence of XY sox5-/- male-to-female sex-reversed fish, predicted to overexpress dmrt1bY according to our results, is in line with the scarcity of surviving YY zygotes—carrying two copies of the dmrt1bY gene—reported in the literature [35].Phenotypic versus genotypic sex of sox5-/-mutants and regulation of the dmrt1 co-orthologs and a set of germ-cell markers in sox5-/- mutant embryos. a Phenotypic versus genotypic sex of sox5-/- mutant fish.

Dataset results of three different batches of eggs obtained from different couples. Statistical significance was assessed with the t-test (N = 3 and each replicate is a pool of 25 eggs; * p value ≤ 0.05, ** p value ≤ 0.01). ns non-significantMonitoring gene expression in the XX embryos of that line, we find the upregulation of PGC marker genes, including nanos2, nanos3, dead-end, and piwi, whereas tra2a and vasa did not show significant changes compared to wild-type embryos (Fig. 8c). Of note is the upregulation of the autosomal dmrt1a in the Sox5 mutant background. The precocious expression of this gene at early stages of development (stages 28 and 32 in Fig. 8c) is intriguing because dmrt1a expression is not expected before 10 days after hatching. This untimely expression may be related to the XX female-to-male sex reversal, because a similar untimely expression of dmrt1a has been seen in high-temperature-induced XX male-to-female sex reversals [36] (and our own unpublished data).SD relies on the proper control of a hierarchically structured, multilayered network of genes. The genes at the top orchestrate complex transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations (see [3, 4, 6, 37] for reviews). Despite such a critical function, they appear to be dispensable in evolutionary terms and can be quickly replaced with the emergence of new lineages. Our present analysis provides evidence that concomitantly to the acquisition of a dominant position within the SD network, the medaka master male determiner, dmrt1bY, was subjected to a profound rearrangement of its regulatory landscape. We found that sequential insertions of both Izanagi and the Rex1 transposon were instrumental for rewiring the dmrt1bY promoter in the process of diversification from its autosomal progenitor dmrt1a.First, the integration site itself appears to be highly relevant. We have previously reported that a P-element-like DNA transposon, Izanagi, brought in a regulatory sequence that mediates specific transcriptional regulation of dmrt1bY, which was important for the Y-chromosomal duplicate to evolve its new function [17]. A common feature of class II transposons is that they can excise. The insertion of the Rex1 element in the dmrt1bY promoter occurred in the DNA-binding domain of the transposase and thereby fixed the Izanagi element and the contained Dmrt1 transcription factor binding motif to the promoter of the new SD gene.Second, the Rex1 transposon contributed a functional high-affinity binding site for the transcription factor Sox5 as a novel regulatory element for dmrt1bY expression. Thus far, neither Sox5 in vertebrates nor its Drosophila homolog Sox102F [38] have been shown to be implicated in SD. In medaka, the expression pattern of sox5 already indicated a function in gonad formation. Indeed, independently of dmrt1bY, sox5 is expressed in the lateral plate mesoderm that later gives rise to the gonad. Thereafter, during gonadogenesis stages, sox5 expression switches toward the germ-cell lineage. There the sox5 expression pattern in PGCs is mutually exclusive with the expression of the master SD gene dmrt1bY, which, during the formation of the gonad primordium, concurrently changes from germ cell to somatic cell expression during this period. This is consistent with the in vitro findings of a suppressive action of Sox5 on the dmrt1bY promoter, although the early expression of sox5 in the lateral plate mesoderm as well as in the adult gonads suggests other additional gonadal functions de-correlated from dmrt1bY activity.It has been shown that Dmrt1bY has a suppressive effect on cell proliferation by mediating a G2 arrest [39]. Thus, continued expression of dmrt1bY in PGCs during early embryonic stages, which precede the actual SD stage at hatching, could have a negative effect on the number of PGCs that is presumed to be decisive at the SD stage [40, 41]. Clearly the observed suppressive action of sox5 toward dmrt1bY expression in vitro and in vivo at stages 33/34, down-modulates this negative effect.Later, the persistence of sox5 expression—independently of dmrt1bY expression—in germ cells within the gonadal primordium and in the early-differentiated germ cells of mature gonads indicates another independent major role in germ-cell physiology from gonad induction to adult development and maintenance. Hence, it is likely that following the transcriptional rewiring of dmrt1bY first by Izanagi and then by Rex1 TEs, Sox5 has been hijacked in the primary SD cascade for controlling and fine-tuning dmrt1bY expression during the male-determining period. Independent of the regulatory function of dmrt1bY, Sox5 appears to have a more general involvement during gonadal formation (visible by expression in the lateral plate mesoderm) and germ-cell physiology (apparent from persistence of sox5 expression in germ cells).Although not directly related to dmrt1bY regulation during the formation of the male gonadal primordium, the most convincing evidence for a sexual development function of Sox5 comes from medaka strains that carry knockout alleles for this gene. We find that lack of Sox5 leads to a decrease in PGC numbers, which is rescued by re-introducing the wild-type version of the gene in mutant embryos. Strikingly, at the molecular level, we found an upregulation of several germ-cell markers in the mutants, even though the germ-cell number is sensibly reduced. It can be assumed that such overexpression in mutants is an indication of an insufficient compensatory mechanism needed to rescue germ-cell numbers properly. These findings demonstrate that germ-cell marker expression levels upon Sox5 modulation are primarily the result of gene expression regulation and are not due to the number of cells that express these genes.The XX female-to-male sex reversal in the Sox5 mutant is in line with an inferred important function of maintaining the appropriate number of PGCs. The number of PGCs at the SD stage is critical for determining male or female sex in medaka [39, 42]. It is higher in females at the SD stage. Lowering the number of germ cells in medaka or zebrafish results in female-to-male sex reversal [43, 44]. Hence, when the number of PGCs falls below the threshold in sox5-/- mutant XX fish, it will permit male development. Interestingly, we find an ectopic and earlier than normal expression of dmrt1a in the primordial gonad of the mutants. This has also been observed in environmentally induced XX female-to-male sex reversal in medaka and has been interpreted as a compensatory mechanism to supply the necessary trigger for testis development in the absence of dmrt1bY [36, 45].Sox5 regulation of dmrt1bY and the importance of this gene for sexual development in medaka raise the question of whether this co-option of Sox5 regulation through Rex1 insertion brought a novel member into the SD regulatory network as a medaka-specific evolutionary innovation or whether this event provided a necessary connection to an indispensable gonad-development downstream pathway. This is difficult to answer at present but should motivate further studies on the role of Sox5 in the formation of ovaries and testes in other species.The in vitro data of sox5 effects on dmrt1 transcriptional regulation in zebrafish and wrasse [18, 19] point to an evolutionarily conserved function of Sox5 that have been unnoticed so far. Members of the SOX family of transcription factors play essential roles during SD in mammals. Both the founding member of the SRY family and the closely related factor SOX9 have been shown to be necessary and sufficient for mammalian male SD [46, 47]. In addition, other SOX family members, such as SOX3 and SOX10, can take over this role if they are expressed ectopically in the developing testis at the time of SD, as demonstrated in transgenic mice and in human patients with duplications in these genes [48,49,50,51,52,53]. In contrast, Sox5 has been implicated in spermatogenesis in the adult [54, 55] but not in embryonic gonad development and/or SD in mouse. With all necessary notes of caution, our preliminary data detecting SOX5 expression in the fetal gonad of mice may indicate an additional role for SOX5 during embryonic gonad development in mice after SD.The finding that a preformed transcription factor binding site contributed by the Rex1 transposon modulates the regulation of dmrt1bY promoter highlights the important role that mobile elements play in the genome for shaping the evolution of new functions. Intriguingly, although bona fide examples of this process are still rare [16], Rex1 is the second such event found in the same promoter. It will be interesting to analyze whether the other repeats present in the dmrt1bY, but not in the promoter region of dmrt1a, provide further instances of TE exaptation. Genes that arose by gene duplication such as dmrt1bY are primarily dispensable and can only escape degeneration through sub- or neo-functionalization. As dmrt1bY and dmrt1a both have exclusive functions in male sexual development in line with the highly conserved role of dmrt1 in invertebrates and vertebrates [56], a change in transcriptional control via the insertion of two different TEs might initially have led to sub-functionalization; dmrt1bY acquired its transient early expression, whereas the transcription of dmrt1a was pushed back to the later testis differentiation phase. In other fish species, and in mouse and chicken, dmrt1, which represents the evolutionary precursor of the two genes in medaka, is expressed starting in very early male SD stages and continues to be expressed during testis differentiation and specialization and in the post-pubertal reproductively active organ [6, 37, 57,58,59].In summary, the evolutionary history of the promoter of a newly arising SD gene in medaka not only provides a new example for TE-mediated rewiring that created evolutionary novelty but also shows the unexpected complexity and richness of such elements. It will be interesting to have a closer look at the SD genes of other fish that have been subject to fast evolutionary change and thus, might also be targets for TE exaptation.In addition to showing that sox5 was recruited—or more exactly promoted thanks to neo-functionalization—to the very top of the primary SD cascade after insertion of Rex1 and that it controls the fine-tuning of dmrt1bY expression, our results provide evidence for a more general and ancestral SD function of Sox5 in regulating germ-cell number and, in consequence, gonadal identity.Testes from adult fish were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in balanced salt solution (111 mM NaCl, 5.37 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2.H2O, 0.6 mM MgSO4.7H2O, and 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.3) for 30 minutes on ice. After fixation, samples were washed three times for 10 minutes with MABT buffer (100 mM maleic acid, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and subsequently twice for 30 minutes with MABDT buffer (MABT buffer complemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% dimethyl sulfoxide). After blocking in MABDT-blocking buffer (MABDT buffer supplemented with 2% lamb or sheep serum), the tissues were incubated in MABDT-blocking buffer together with anti-11-β-hydroxylase primary antibody (1:150 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. Samples were then washed three times for 5 minutes in MABDT buffer and washed again four times for 30 minutes in MABDT-blocking buffer on ice. Thereafter, samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the secondary antibody diluted at 1:600 in MABDT-blocking buffer. Finally, the tissues were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, stained with Hoechst solution for 3 hours at 4 °C, mounted and imaged with a confocal microscope (Nikon C1 confocal microscope). For Additional file 4: Figure S3, immunohistochemistry was performed according to [60] using the mouse anti-SOX5 antibody from Abcam (ab26041).For ChIP, the EpiQuik ChIP kit (Epigentek) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using 1 million cells (Sg3 spermatogonial or OLF fibroblast cell lines) of transiently transfected cells with FLAG-tagged Sox5 and 3XFLAG antibodies for immunoprecipitation. After fixation and cell re-suspension, DNA was sheared by sonication (nine pulses of 10 seconds with an amplitude of 10%). After immunoprecipitation, specific primer sets were used for enrichment quantification by real-time PCR. For controls, primer sets encompassing regions without any sox binding sites were used. The results are presented as enrichment compared to input. All primer sets were checked for the specificity of the amplifications.Binding sites for Dmrt1bY were identified using the matrix provided by [61] together with the Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools portal (RSat) [62]. Sox5 transcription factor binding sites were determined using MatInspector from the Genomatix portal [63] using the following positional weight matrix: [A, C, G, T: (4, 6, 3, 9), (7, 4, 3, 8), (21, 0, 1, 1), (22, 0, 1, 0), (0, 22, 0, 1), (23, 0, 0, 0), (22, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 23), (10, 3, 6, 4), (5, 7, 6, 5)].Medaka spermatogonial (Sg3) and fibroblast-like (OLF) cell lines were cultured as previously described [64,65,66]. For transfection, cells were grown to 80% confluency in six-well plates and transfected with 5 μg of expression vector using FuGene (Roche) reagent as described by the manufacturer.Total RNA was extracted from fish tissues or transfected cells using the TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) according to the supplier’s recommendation. After DNase treatment, reverse transcription was performed with 2 μg of total RNA using a RevertAid First Strand Synthesis kit (Fermentas) and random primers. Real-time quantitative PCR was carried out with SYBR Green reagents and amplifications were detected with an i-Cycler (Biorad). All results are averages of at least two independent real-time reactions. Error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean. Relative expression levels were calculated (according to 2 – ΔCT where CT is the number of cycles) after correction of the expression of elongation factor 1 alpha (ef1alpha).For promoter analysis, a 9107-bp fragment upstream of the Dmrt1bY ORF was isolated by restriction enzyme digestion (XhoI/EcoRI) from BAC clone Mn0113N21 [17] and cloned into pBSII-ISceI plasmid (pBSII-ISceI::[0/-8927] Kb Dmrt1bY. Subsequently, the Gaussia luciferase gene from the pGLuc-basic plasmid (New England Biolabs) was inserted between EcoRI and NotI sites of pBSII-ISceI:: [0/-8927] Kb Dmrt1bY prom (pBSIIISceI:: [0/-8927] Kb Dmrt1bY prom::GLuc plasmid, Fig. 2). pBSII-ISceI:: [0/-1593] Kb Dmrt1bY prom::GLuc, pBSII-ISceI:: [0/-2963] Kb Dmrt1bY prom::GLuc and pBSII-ISceI:: [0/-6162] Kb Dmrt1bY prom::-GLuc plasmids were constructed in the same way, removing 5′ fragments of the 9107-bp Dmrt1bY promoter region using Kpn1, Eco47III, and HindIII restriction enzyme digestion, respectively, and re-ligation.Gaussia luciferase activity was quantified using the Luciferase Reporter Assay System from Promega and normalized against co-transfected firefly luciferase expressing plasmid (ptkLUC+). For Fig. 2c, [α], [α]-MUT, and [β] fragments (same as used for the ChIP assay shown in Fig. 2a) were PCR amplified and cloned into ptkLUC+ plasmid (accession number AF027128) between HindIII and BamHI restriction sites.A transgenic line was created for the in vivo visualization of endogenous sox5 expression as well as in vivo functional knock-in of sox5. The Sox5 upstream promoter region of the Sox5 gene was cloned in front of an [mCherry-stop] cassette flanked with LoxP sites (Fig. 7c). In detail, in a first line, the sox5 promoter region drives the expression of an mCherry-Stop cassette. This cassette is followed by a Sox5 ORF fused (2A self-cleaving system [33]) with a nuclear-addressed GFP (H2B-GFP). For recombination, direct microinjection of one-cell-stage embryos with mRNA encoding for the Cre-NLS protein was performed (Fig. 7d–f). Sox5 -/- homozygosity of the fish was determined according to the pigmentation pattern of the embryos (see [21]).To generate stable transgenic lines, the meganuclease protocol was used [67]. Briefly, approximately 10 to 15 pg of total vector DNA in a volume of 500 pl injection solution containing I-SceI meganuclease was injected into the cytoplasm of one-cell-stage medaka embryos (Carbio strain). Adult F0 fish were mated to each other and the offspring were tested for the presence of the transgene by checking for fluorescence. Siblings from positive F1 fish were raised to adulthood and tested again for fluorescence.For PGC visualization and counting, the GFP-nos1 3′ UTR construct that includes the mmGFP5 ORF cloned upstream of the 3′ UTR of the zebrafish nanos1 gene [68, 69] was injected at the one-cell stage (Fig. 7f).For imaging, embryos, hatchlings, or tissues were mounted with 1.2% low melting temperature agarose. Confocal pictures and image stacks were acquired using Nikon C1 (eclipse Ti) confocal laser scanning and the NIS element AR software.RNA whole-mount in situ hybridizations were performed as previously described [70]. Hybridization signals were detected using alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-DIG antibody (Roche) and BM-purple (Roche) as chromogen.The Sox5 medaka mutant strain (N541S) has been deposited with the National Bioresource Center [71].Bachtrog D, et al.

Part of Springer Nature.Sex-bias in gene expression is a widespread mechanism for controlling the development of phenotypes that differ between males and females. Most studies on sex-bias in gene expression have focused on species that exhibit traditional sex-roles (male-male competition and female parental care). By contrast the Syngnathid fishes (sea horses, pipefish, and sea dragons) are a group of organisms where many species exhibit male brooding and sex-role reversal (female-female competition for mates and paternal parental care), and little is known about how patterns of sex-bias in gene expression vary in species with sex-role reversal. Here we utilize RNA-seq technology to investigate patterns of sex-bias in gene expression in the brain tissue of the Gulf Pipefish (Syngnathus scovelli) a species that exhibits sex-role reversal. Gene expression analysis identified 73 sex-biased genes, 26 genes upregulated in females and 47 genes upregulated in males. Gene ontology analysis found 52 terms enriched for the sex-biased genes in a wide range of pathways suggesting that multiple functions and processes differ between the sexes. We focused on two areas of interest: sex steroids/hormones and circadian rhythms, both of which exhibited sex-bias in gene expression, and are known to influence sexual development in other species. Lastly, the work presented herein contributes to a growing body of genome data available for the Syngnathids, increasing our knowledge on patterns of gene expression in these unusual fishes.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

A recent study showed that female guppies are twice as efficient as males in a reversal learning task involving yellow–red discrimination, suggesting a higher cognitive flexibility in female guppies. However, the possibility exists that the superior performance exhibited by females does not reflect a general sex difference in cognitive abilities, but instead, is confined to colour discrimination tasks. To address this issue, we compared male and female guppies in two different discrimination reversal learning tasks and we performed a meta-analysis of these experiments and the previous one involving colour discrimination. In the first experiment of this study, guppies were tested in a task requiring them to learn to select the correct arm of a T-maze in order to rejoin a group of conspecifics. In experiment 2, guppies were observed in a numerical task requiring them to discriminate between 5 and 10 dots in order to obtain a food reward. Although females outperformed males in one condition of the T-maze, we did not find any clear evidence of females’ greater reversal learning performance in either experiment. However, the meta-analysis of the three experiments supported the hypothesis of females’ greater reversal learning ability. Our data do not completely exclude the idea that female guppies have a generally higher cognitive flexibility than males; however, they suggest that the size of this sex difference might depend on the task.This is a preview of subscription content, log in to check access.Agrillo C, Bisazza A (2014) Spontaneous versus trained numerical abilities.

We isolated two mutants with premature stops in the ovarian aromatase (cyp19a1) gene from an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-based gene-driven mutagenesis library of the medaka, Oryzias latipes. In XX mutants, gonads first differentiated into normal ovaries containing many ovarian follicles that failed to accumulate yolk. Subsequently, ovarian tissues underwent extensive degeneration, followed by the appearance of testicular tissues on the dorsal side of ovaries. In the newly formed testicular tissue, strong expression of gsdf was detected in sox9a2-positive somatic cells surrounding germline stem cells suggesting that gsdf plays an important role in testicular differentiation during estrogen-depleted female-to-male sex reversal. We conclude that endogenous estrogens synthesized after fertilization are not essential for early ovarian differentiation but are critical for the maintenance of adult ovaries.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Some tdrd genes, especially multi‐Tudor members, participate in Piwi‐interacting RNA pathway and spermatogenesis. However, tdrd evolution and their functions in teleost fish are poorly understood. Here, we identified 14 tdrds in the teleost fish, swamp eel, which were clustered into 12 tdrd branches. Comparative synteny showed biased duplications and loss of members in the tdrd family. Both tdrd6 and tdrd7 were duplicated in the teleost fish, whereas tdrd8 was lost from the original locus. Expression analysis at both RNA and protein levels showed that tdrd6l, a duplicated multi‐Tudor member, was gonad enriched. Expression pattern of tdrd6l in follicular epithelium and seminiferous epithelium during sex reversal supports its potential role in genome defense in germline.Volume328, Issue8December 2017Pages 727-736© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Working off-campus? Learn about our remote access optionsThe medaka extended one‐generation test (MEOGRT) was developed as a multigenerational toxicity test for chemicals, particularly endocrine‐disrupting chemicals. Briefly, 3 generations of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) are exposed to a chemical over a 20‐wk period: 3 wk in the parental generation (F0), 15 wk in the first generation (F1), and 2 wk in the second generation (F2). The present study reports the first MEOGRT results concerning branched isomer mixtures of 4‐nonylphenol (NP). Adult F0 medaka exposed to NP at 5 actual concentrations (1.27, 2.95, 9.81, 27.8, 89.4 µg/L) were unaffected in terms of reproduction, although vitellogenin in the male liver was increased dose‐dependently at concentration of 2.95 µg/L and higher. In F1, in contrast, total egg (fecundity), fertile egg, and fertility decreased as NP increased; lowest‐observed‐effect concentrations (LOECs) for total egg, fertile egg, and fertility were 1.27, 1.27, 27.8 µg/L, respectively. In F1, but not in F0, secondary sex characteristics (i.e., anal fin papillae in males) were suppressed at 27.8 µg/L NP. Vitellogenin induction in adult male fish was slightly weaker in F1 than it was in F0, however. Gonadal sex abnormality and sex reversal occurred at 27.8 and 89.4 µg/L NP in F1 subadults. At 89.4 µg/L NP, all genotypic F1 males in breeding pairs had female phenotype, and some even demonstrated spawning. Concentrations of NP lower than 89.4 µg/L did not affect F2 survival or hatching. The highest detected NP level in environmental freshwater in Japan was approximately a half of the LOEC (1.27 µg/L for F1 fecundity); in other countries, however, environmental concentrations above the LOEC are reported, suggesting that NP may be affecting fish populations.

How to understand and manipulate this process is one of the major issues for the rice field eel stocking. So far the genomics and transcriptomics data available for this species are still scarce. Here we provide a comprehensive study of transcriptomes of brain and gonad tissue in three sex stages (female, intersex and male) from the rice field eel to investigate changes in transcriptional level during the sex reversal process.Approximately 195 thousand unigenes were generated and over 44.4 thousand were functionally annotated. Comparative study between stages provided multiple differentially expressed genes in brain and gonad tissue. Overall 4668 genes were found to be of unequal abundance between gonad tissues, far more than that of the brain tissues (59 genes). These genes were enriched in several different signaling pathways. A number of 231 genes were found with different levels in gonad in each stage, with several reproduction-related genes included. A total of 19 candidate genes that could be most related to sex reversal were screened out, part of these genes’ expression patterns were validated by RT-qPCR. The expression of spef2, maats1, spag6 and dmc1 were abundant in testis, but was barely detected in females, while the 17β-hsd12, zpsbp3, gal3 and foxn5 were only expressed in ovary.This study investigated the complexity of brain and gonad transcriptomes in three sex stages of the rice field eel. Integrated analysis of different gene expression and changes in signaling pathways, such as PI3K-Akt pathway, provided crucial data for further study of sex transformation mechanisms.Citation: Chi W, Gao Y, Hu Q, Guo W, Li D (2017) Genome-wide analysis of brain and gonad transcripts reveals changes of key sex reversal-related genes expression and signaling pathways in three stages of Monopterus albus.

Although most animals occur in two morphological distinct sexes, sex determination can be various and flexible. Primary sex-determining signals can either be genetically controlled or environmentally induced, or both, in some occasions [1, 2]. In animals with genetic sex determination (GSD), the primary sex of an individual is determined once the fusion of spermotozoa and egg is done. Sex-linked genes initiate sexually dimorphic pathways during development, directing the gonad to differentiate into the testis or ovary. In mammals, for example, male sex determination is controlled by the sex-determining region on Y chromosome (SRY), which encodes a DNA-binding protein that acts dominantly to trigger differentiation of the testes from undifferentiated gonads that otherwise develop as ovaries [3, 4]. In birds and reptiles, an SRY-related gene sox9 is thought to dominantly control male differentiation [5–7]. Gene dmrt1 is demonstrated to be required for testis determination in chicken by means of knockdown via RNA interference, which resulted in feminization of the embryonic gonads in genetically male (ZZ) embryos [8]. Another gene termed dm-w, the binding domain of which shows a strikingly high identity with that of dmrt1, is proved playing a crucial role in primary ovary formation of amphibians [9]. In medaka, a copy of dmrt1 gene, named dmrt1y, was found expressed during male embryonic and larval development and in the Sertoli cells of the adult testes, making it responsible for male medaka sex determination [10]. The dmy gene was also found crucial for male medaka sexsual differentiation, mutations on dmy could result in all XY female offspring [11]. In animals with environmental sex determination (ESD), since lacking any consistent heritable genetic difference between the sexes, their sexual identity is established by one or several environmental cues after fertilization [12]. Environmental cues involved in ESD can be biotic or abiotic, including population density, steroids, pathogens, temperature and pH [13–15]. Temperature is most broadly studied environmental cue, particularly in reptiles [15, 16].Generally, once the sex of an individual is determined, it will be fixed for life. But in some fish species, sex can be changed under certain circumstances, such as, being exposed to hormones. As a result of aquaculture and physiology research, to date the sex-reversing effects of a variety of chemicals have been tested on hundreds of fish species from a range of families [17–19]. However, in some particular fishes, the primary sex can be altered naturally during development, changing into the opposite sex with the genotype remained. The rice field eel, Monopterus albus, taxonomically belongs to teleosts, the family Synbranchidae of the order Synbranchiformes, is an important economic freshwater fish of Southeast Asia. Early study has confirmed that the rice-field eel experiences natural sex reversal during its life [20], which is that it starts its sexual life history as a female, undergoes an intersex stage, and then develops into the final male stage [21, 22]. The molecular mechanism underlies this special biological process draws many researchers’ attention, and studies showed that several sex differentiation and maturation related genes were involved. Two homologous genes, sox9 and sox17, were identified in the rice field eel, which showed similar structures and high identities comparing to mammals, indicating evolutionarily conserved roles in sex determination and differentiation [23], and this speculation was supported by subsequent experimental analysis [24, 25]. The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), a member from the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, displayed a distinct expression pattern, with a high expression level in ovary, then kept dropping down during the sex transformation [26]. It’s been known to us that androgen signaling is essential for male sexual differentiation. Study in the rice field eel androgen receptor (AR) reflected an increasing tendency on expression during gonadal transformation from ovary via ovotestis to testis, and a novel nuclear export pathway for AR has been found [27]. Two genes that encode cytochrome P450 aromatase and cytochrome P45011β-hydroxylase are found playing crucial roles during gonadal sex change, with the P450arom predominantly expressed in ovary and P45011β mainly expressed in testis [28].The natural sex reversal severely affects the sex ratio and thus decreases the productivity of the rice field eel. How to manipulate this process is one of the major issues for the rice field eel stocking. So far the genomics and transcriptomics data available for this species are still scarce. For further developmental analysis it is important to establish the scale of transcripts variation on a genome-wide level and to identify the whole differentially expressed transcripts, including non-coding transcripts (small RNAs) in three sex stages. By expanding our previously published results about the differential expression patterns of microRNAs in three genders of the rice field eel [29], we sequenced the gonad and brain transcriptomes from three sex stages of rice field eel, respectively. Using stringent filtering criteria and manual curation, we characterize these transcripts in terms of transcript length, conservation and expression pattern during sex reversal and thus anticipate that our catalogue of coding transcripts will enable more developmental and genomic studies directed towards sex reversal mechanisms.The rice field eels were obtained from markets located in LiShui Road in Wuhan, China (coordinate N30°27′55.94″, E114°15′33.89″), and were kept in fresh water for seven days before experiment. The rice field eels were anaesthetized with MS222 (350mg/L) before sampling. The sexes were confirmed by microscopic analysis of their gonad sections. A total of 36 adult rice field eels were collected for experiment, 12 individuals for each sexual phase. Tissue samples were collected from the gonad and brain (including pituitary) of different sexual phases of rice field eels (Monopterus albus). Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA), suspended in RNase-free water and evaluated by electrophoresis and a Nanodrop 2000c UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Mass., USA). The experiments were performed in accordance with the International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals as promulgated by the Society for the Study of Reproduction. The experimental procedures were also approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Huazhong Agricultural University (Wuhan, China).RNA samples (n = 12) from each sexual phase were mixed together by tissue with equivalent amount (3μg RNA per sample) after examination. Sequencing libraries were generated using Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumia, San Diego, USA) following manufacturer’s recommendations. Briefly, mRNA was purified from total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. Fragmentation was carried out using divalent cations under elevated temperature in Illumina proprietary fragmentation buffer. First strand cDNA was synthesized using random oligonucleotides and SuperScript II. Second strand cDNA synthesis was subsequently performed using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. After adenylation of 3’ ends of DNA fragments, Illumina PE adapter oligonucleotides were ligated to prepare for hybridization. In order to select cDNA fragments of preferentially 200 bp in length, the library fragments were purified with AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA). DNA fragments with ligated adaptor molecules on both ends were selectively enriched using Illumina PCR Primer Cocktail in a 10 cycle PCR reaction. Products were purified (AMPure XP system) and quantified using the Agilent high sensitivity DNA assay on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. After cluster generation, the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform and 90 bp paired-end reads were generated.Raw data were firstly processed to generate clean reads before assembly. In this step, reads with adapters, reads containing over 10% ploy-N and low quality reads were discarded. All the downstream analyses were based on the clean reads. The high quality reads were assembled into unigenes using Trinity with min_kmer_cov as 2 and other parameters as default settings [30]. Unigenes were firstly compared by Blastx (E-value<10−5) to databases of Nr, Nt and Swiss-Prot, retrieving proteins with the highest sequence similarity with the given unigenes along with their protein functional annotations, and searched against the Pfam database [31] using the HMMER 3.0 package [32] for homologs of protein sequences. The best aligning results were defined according to the feedback E-value, and the first hits were used for further analysis. Functional annotation by Gene Ontology (GO) terms was analyzed by Blast2Go software [33], and summarized using WEGO software[34]. Unigenes were also aligned to the Eukaryotic orthologous groups (KOG) database to predict and classify possible functions. Pathway annotation was performed by blast against the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database.Prior to differential gene expression analysis, for each sequenced library, the read counts were adjusted by edgeR program package through one scaling normalized factor [35]. To gain the statistic confirmation of the differences in gene expression in the brain and gonad among different sex stages of the rice field eel, we first mapped the reads of each sample to the reference transcriptome using the RSEM software [36] with default settings, then the number of reads that mapped to each unigene was calculated according to the mapping results. Different sequencing samples data were normalized in RPKM (reads per kilo bases per million mapped reads). Differential expression analysis of two sexual phases was performed using the DEGseq (2010) R package, a free R package used to identify differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq data. pvalue was adjusted using qvalue [37]. qvalue<0.005 & |log2 (foldchange)|>1 was set as the threshold for significantly differential expression.For the selection of maximum differential expression unigene in gonad, the RPKM of each unigene were used in different gonad stage of the rice field eel. While referring to the functional annotation in Nr, Nt, Swiss-Prot and other databases, the candidate genes related to sex differentiation were screened. The screening method was as follows: 1) The RPKM of each unigene among different sequencing samples was |log2 (fold change)|>3. The candidate genes involving gonad growth, development and differentiation were selected referring to gene annotation in Nr, Nt, Swiss-Prot and other database. 2) According to the KEGG pathway classification, a bunch of genes were screened in maximum differences metabolic pathways at different gonadal development stage of eel’s brain and gonad. The candidate genes were selected referring to the gene functional annotation. 3) The unigenes were screened as alternative gene, which had significant expression difference among different sequencing samples and unmatch to any functional annotation databases. The RPKM of each unigene among different sequencing samples was |log2 (fold change)|>10.Total RNA was extracted from gonad in different development stage of rice field eel (n = 4) using Total RNA kit II (Omega bio-tek) according to manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA concentrations were measured at 260 and 280 nm using a Nanodrop 2000c UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Mass., USA). A 260 nm reading was used to determine the concentration of total RNA and the quality was verified by measuring the 260/280 and 260/230 ratios. Total RNA (1.5 μg) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a HiScript II Q RT SuperMix for qPCR with gDNA wiper kit (Vazyme). Primer sequences for cloning and qPCR were designed and purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Tianyi Huiyuan, Wuhan, China) and PCR product sizes are listed in S1 Table.Quantitative real-time RT–PCR experiments were performed in a final volume of 20μL containing 1μL of original cDNA, 0.8μL of each 10 mM primer, 0.4 μL 50× Rox reference, 7.8 μL of RNase and DNase free H2O, and 10μL of SYBR Green Master Mix (AceQ qPCR; Vazyme). The protocol was: 7 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10s, 60°C for 30s, and 72°C for 30s. qPCR was performed in triplicate using Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen). A melting curve was generated for each run to confirm the specificity of the each product. Fold change was calculated by normalized Ct values against rpl17 [38] gene using the 2-ΔΔct method[39].All statistical analyses were performed using Excel 2013 and SPSS 22.0. Each Ct value used for the calculation was the mean obtained from each cDNA in triplicate. The data were tested for statistical differences using a one-way analysis of variances (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc least significance difference (LSD). Unless otherwise noted, values presented are means ± standard error (SE). In all cases, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Foxn 5 mRNA in the gonad were detected by in situ hybridisation (ISH). The probe (antisense strand) was transcribed with sp6 RNA polymerase (Roche, Germany), and the negative control was performed using a sence probe. The digoxigenin label was incorporated into the single-stranded probe using the Roche DIG RNA labeling kit. ISH staining was photographed using the confocal Laser-scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP, Argon-Krypton Laser).Raw data have been deposited to NCBI SRA database (accession number: SRX1007627). For gonad, we obtained approximately 32 million raw reads from female samples, 27 million from intersex and 34 million from male samples. For brain, about 35 million raw reads were obtained from female samples, 38 million from intersex and 33 million from male samples. The total amount of raw reads was over 208 million. After filtering low quality reads, reads containing over 10% unidentified bases and reads with adapters, about 200 million clean reads were left, covering 39.94Gb nucleotides. The average Q20 percentage and GC content was 97.97% and 48.34%, respectively. With paired-end joining and gap filling, these reads from six samples were assembled, producing 195,301 unigenes with an N50 of 1505 nt and a mean length of 765 nt, including 16121 unigenes with the length over 2000 nt (Fig A in S1 File).As a result, 31343 unigenes were annotated in NR and Pfam database. We also blasted the unigenes to the NCBI nucleotide sequences (NT), Swiss-Prot and to KOG database. Together, 44,445 unigenes were annotated at least in one database, among which 8,335 unigenes were annotated in all databases. The Gene Ontology (GO) assignment system were used to classify the functions of the genes annotated based on the NR and Pfam database. The 31343 unigenes were categorized into 54 functional groups based on sequence homology, and were then assigned to three main categories: biological process, cellular component and molecular function, with 20,639 (65.85%), 12,170 (38.83%) and 17,400 (55.51%) unigenes, respectively (Fig 1). A subset of genes was assigned to more than one category according to their multiple functions. In each category, there were dominant groups of genes that involved in the basic biological process, such as the ‘cellular process’, ‘cell part’ and ‘binding’ group, but much fewer genes can be found in the groups such as ‘cell killing’, ‘antioxidant activity’ and ‘receptor regulator activity’.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173974.g001Based on the BLASTx results against the KEGG database, we classified the 12609 unigenes into different pathways under each main category except ‘human diseases’, and calculated the number of unigenes under the secondary hierarchy of each pathway. It can be noticed in Fig 2 that the most represented pathway was ‘signal transduction’ under the ‘environmental information processing’ category, containing 1888 unigenes (14.97%), next was ‘signaling molecules and interaction’ (973 unigenes, 7.72%), ‘nervous system’ (7.13%) and ‘immune system’ (7.13%), but much less unigenes were found in ‘metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides’ (35 unigenes, 0.28%), ‘biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites’ (42 unigenes, 0.33%) and ‘membrane transport’ (60 unigenes, 0.48%). These annotations provide a valuable resource for investigating the processes, functions and pathways involved in the sex reversal of the rice field eel.A: Cellular Processes; B: Environmental Information Processing; C: Genetic Information Processing; D: Metabolism; E: Organismal Systems.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173974.g002Gene expression was calculated as RPKM and shows a comparable median distribution across sequencing libraries (Fig B in S1 File). Pearson correlation coefficients reveal the similarity within three brain samples (F_brain, I_brain and M_brain) and three gonad samples(F_gonad, I_gonad and M_gonad), respectively. Major changes can be observed between F_gonad and M_gonad, and between I_gonad and M_gonad, while fewer changes could be found between brain samples (Fig B in S1 File). To rule out any bias in correlation arising from low expression values, we filtered the data for a threshold of 1 RPKM in each sample. To investigate how many genes were differentially expressed among the three sex stages, a threshold of qvalue < 0.005 and | log2(fold change)| > 1 was used to minimize false positives. The volcano plot showed the relationships of the fold change and qvalue (adjusted pvalue), red plots stand for genes that were significantly differentially expressed between two samples, while blue plots stand for false positives (Fig C in S1 File).After filtering the false positives results, it showed that 31 genes were differentially expressed between F_brain and I_brain (S2 Table), 17 of which were up-regulated, including genes encoding Corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 (comp164609_c3), Somatotropin (comp96240_c0), and genes involved in signal transduction, such as the Voltage-dependent P/Q-type calcium channel subunit alpha (comp164946_c0). Fourteen genes were down-regulated, with the follicle stimulating hormone beta subunit included. The follicle stimulating hormone is secreted by pituitary and showed great importance in early gonad differentiation and follicle development [40–42]. Twenty-five genes were differentially expressed between I_brain and M_brain, including 18 up-regulated genes and 7 down-regulated ones (S3 Table). Thirty-three genes showed different expression level between F_brain and M_brain, with 9 genes down-regulated and 24 up-regulated (S4 Table).The venn diagram (Fig 3A) indicated that 5 genes were differentially expressed in the intersex comparing to female and male, but showed no changes between female and male, indicating that these genes experienced abundance alteration in the middle of the sex reversal process. One of these genes encodes the luteinizing hormone (comp88640_c0), a very important hormone that can trigger ovulation in females, and meanwhile can stimulate Leydig cells and maintain sperm quality and quantity in males [43–45]. The gene encoding growth hormone together with other 6 genes were found differentially expressed both between female and intersex, and between female and male, but no difference between intersex and male eels. The transcript abundance of two unigenes were found to be significantly changed during the three sex stages, one of which is the immunoglobulin mu heavy chain coding gene (comp164514_c1), suggesting the immune function was affected during the sex alteration. To investigate expression patterns of these genes, we performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering to sex stages and K-means clustering to group genes according to their expression (Figs D and E in S1 File). It showed that many genes are activated at the intersex stage, but still several genes are more strongly induced at the male stage.F: female, I: intersex, M: male.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173974.g003The gonad experienced tremendous morphological changes during sex transformation, along with which a great abundant of genes shifted their expression in different sex stages. To gain insight into the alteration of gene expression in the gonad, multiple comparisons were made between F_gonad, I_gonad and M_gonad. Unlike the brain, far more abundant genes were detected differentially expressed in the gonad between different sex stages. Overall 4668 genes were found to be of unequal abundance in the comparisons, 15.6% of which (730 genes) were detected between F_gonad and I_gonad, 62.3% (2906 genes) between I_gonad and M_gonad, and 87.4% (4078 genes) between F_gonad and M_gonad. To correlate these profiles with gene function, enrichment for GO terms were examined by Blast2Go software [33]. Of the 730 genes with unequal abundance between F_gonad and I_gonad, 322 were up-regulated, which were mainly assigned into 11 sub-categories (Fig 4A). A great abundant of gene were involved in “cellular component” such as cytoskeleton and microtubule complex. Furthermore, several well-known genes that are associated with goand development, such as spag6 (Sperm-associated antigen 6), spag17, spag1, spef2 and tctex1, were up-regulated during the transformation from ovary to ovotestis. The other 408 down-regulated genes were assigned into 17 sub-categories, most of which were molecular function related (Fig 4B), involving in the activities of different kind of enzymes. Over a hundred of these genes were hydrolase-activity related. Besides, several gonad development related genes such as vitellogenin receptor, dual specificity testis-specific protein kinase and sox3, were also down regulated during the transformation from ovary to ovotestis. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed these down-regulated genes were mainly enriched in PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (28 genes, qvalue<0.01), protein digestion and absorption (26 genes, qvalue<0.01), focal adhesion (25 genes, qvalue<0.01) and ECM-receptor interaction (24 genes, qvalue<0.01, Fig F in S1 File).A: up-regulated genes comparing F_gonad to I_gonad. B: down-regulated genes comparing F_gonad to I_gonad. C: up-regulated genes comparing I_gonad to M_gonad. D: down-regulated genes comparing I_gonad to M_gonad.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173974.g004Of the 2906 genes differentially expressed between I_gonad and M_gonad, 1064 were up regulated and were categorized into 16 different sub-categories (Fig 4C), with the majority of genes related with “binding” functions. These genes were mainly enriched in lysine degradation pathway (qvalue<0.05, Fig G in S1 File). The other 1842 down-regulated genes showed a great enrichment in the “metabolic process”, “cell”, “cell part” and “catalytic activity” (Fig 4D). These genes were mainly enriched in metabolic pathway (141 genes, qvalue<0.05), lysosome (30 genes, qvalue<0.01) and Protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum (32 genes, qvalue<0.05, Fig H in S1 File). Finally, the comparison between F_gonad and M_gonad revealed that over four thousand genes shifted their transcript abundance, with 1940 up-regulated and 2138 down-regulated. It can be noticed that these changes seriously affected the molecular binding process and metabolic process (Fig 5). Those up regulated genes were mainly enriched in Lysine degradation pathway (16 genes, qvalue<0.01, Fig I in S1 File), while those down-regulated ones were mainly enriched in metabolic pathway (166 genes, qvalue<0.05), lysosome (38 genes, qvalue<0.01), biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (55 genes, qvalue<0.05), and microbial metabolism during the transformation (39 genes, qvalue<0.05, Fig J in S1 File).A: up-regulated genes. B: down-regulated genes.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173974.g005To investigate expression patterns of these genes, we performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering to sex stages and K-means clustering to group genes according to their expression (Figs D and K in S1 File). These genes were divided into 6 sub clusters based on their expression pattern. Within these genes, 231 were found with different expression in three sex stages (Fig 3B), including several reproduction-related genes, such as sperm flagellar protein 2-like (comp160618_c0), amh (comp148436_c0), AMY-1-associating protein (comp146331_c0), Sperm-associated antigen 6 (comp67196_c0) and piwi-like protein 1 (comp164266_c0). All these genes followed a trend that it maintained a low expression level in the female stage and kept rising through intersex to male stage. The piwi-like protein 1 was one of highly expressed genes in the male gonad, it plays a central role during spermatogenesis by repressing transportable elements and preventing their mobilization, which is essential for the germline integrity [46]. The vitelline membrane outer layer protein 1 homolog and cyp19a1, along with other 390 genes, were found with different expression level between F_gonad and I_gonad, and between F_gonad and M_gonad, but of the same abundance between I_gonad and M_gonad. The cyp19a1 encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes, which catalyzes the last steps of estrogen biosynthesis [47–49]. The down-regulation of cyp19a1 indicated that the synthesis of estrogen was reduced when the rice-field eel stepped into the intersex.A total of 19 candidate genes that related to gonad differentiation were screened according to the gene annotation and analysis of gene differential expression (Table 1). According to the gene functional annotations, these genes were functionally involved in meiosis, steroid metabolism, sperm biosynthesis, reproduction and gonadal developmental in maintaining important physiological processes. To validate the transcriptome sequencing results, 9 unigenes from these 19 genes were randomly selected to determine their expression levels in different gonads of the rice field eel by RT-qPCR (Fig 6). The expression levels of 8 genes were consistent with the transcriptome data set except for chps2. Based on our data set, the expression of spef2, maats1, spag6 and dmc1 were more abundant in males, but was barely detected in females. While the expression of 17β-hsd12, zpsbp3, gal3 and foxn5 was mainly detected in ovary. These genes could be the most promising candidates affecting the rice field eel’s sex transformation process. We chose one of these genes, foxn5, to perform in situ hybridization analysis. The result showed that the expression of foxn5 was detected mainly in the egg envelope and the early phase of follicles, but not in the mature ones (Fig 7), suggesting the functional importance of foxn5 in the early development of the follicles in the rice field eel.The “*” stands for p < 0.05.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173974.g006The digoxigenin label was incorporated into the single-stranded probe, and a sense a sense probe was used as negative control. It showed that the expression of foxn5 was located in the egg envelope and the early phase of follicles. A: nucleus dyed by PI; B: localization of foxn5, marked by white arrow: C: merged A and B. D-F for negative control.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173974.g007https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173974.t001In vertebrates, reproduction is primarily controlled by the HPG (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal) axis, and the structure of this endocrine pathway is highly conserved in jawed vertebrates. The hypothalamic neuroendocrine system regulates synthesis and release of the gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating-hormone (FSH) and LH, from the pituitary, which in turn stimulate gonadal development, in particular via the induction of sex steroid synthesis. Sex steroids feedback to the hypothalamus and the pituitary, thereby regulate gonadotropin synthesis and release [50, 51]. So we sequenced the brain (including pituitary) and gonad tissue to explore gene expression patterns among sex stages. In our study, the level of the FSH beta subunit precursor was different between F_brain and I_brain, but with no difference between F_brain and M_brain. To our knowledge this is because that the FSH stimulates the maturation of germ cells in both females and males. In females, the FSH initiates follicular growth, specifically affecting granulosa cells. In males, it is required for the determination of Sertoli cell number, and for induction and maintenance of normal sperm production[52]. The LH beta subunit was differentially expressed comparing F_brain to I_brain, and I_brain to M_brain, but of the same level between F_brain and M_brain. This is probably because in both females and males, the LH is essential for reproduction. Beside the function of triggering ovulation, the LH can also stimulate Leydig cells and maintain sperm quality and quantity in males [43–45], and thus it was also call interstitial cell-stimulating hormone (ICSH) [44]. The growth hormone (GH, comp96240_c0) show a higher expression level in M_brain than in F_brain, this could be one of the reasons that the male eels grow faster and larger than females [53, 54].The gonad experienced tremendous morphological changes during sex transformation, and far more genes shifted their expression within this process. Several genes involved in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway decreased their expression during the ovary-to-ovotestis transformation, such as serine/threonine-protein kinase Sgk1-like (comp154545_c0), cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 1 (comp163815_c2) and DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4 protein (comp145559_c0). The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway regulates fundamental cellular functions such as transcription, translation, proliferation, growth and oocyte maturation in fish [55, 56], and can be activated by estrogenic hormone and the autocrine/paracrine system [56–58], thus we speculated that one of the reasons that caused the down-regulation of this signaling pathway might be changes of receptors’ activity on the cell membrane, the lack of estrogenic hormone and the weak ovarian autocrine/paracrine activity. The synthesis of estrogenic hormone was strongly regulated by the cytochrome p450 aromatase and the 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. The cytochrome p450 aromatase (cyp19) is the terminal enzyme is the steroidogenic pathway that converts androgens into estrogens, therefore, appropriate expression of the enzyme is of great importance for reproduction as well as being pivotal in sex differentiation for most vertebrates. In our data, the cyp19 was expressed mainly in females, while in males it was barely detected, which was in accordance with other researchers’ experimental results [59]. It is well known to us that microRNA is playing a crucial role in modulating gene expression, and it has become clear that cyp19a was one of the targets of miR-181 and let-7f [60, 61]. Thus the expression of these two miRNAs should theoretically be lower in females than in males, since miRNAs can only down regulate target genes. However, according to our previous comparative study of rice field eel microRNA transcriptomes, the expression of let-7f maintained a high but equal level within three genders, while that of the miR-181 was found more abundant in females comparing to males [29]. This is probably because of the multi-functions of each miRNA, and diverse regulating pathway of genes. The 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 12 (17β-Hsd12) is an important enzyme that can regulate the biological activity of steroid hormones at the pre-receptor level in many microorganisms, invertebrates and vertebrates [62]. It mainly catalyzes the reduction of C17-ketosteroids to their corresponding hydroxylated forms as well as the reverse reaction, and is able to convert inactive or less active steroid hormones into more potent ones and vice versa, certain 17β-Hsds play a key role, especially in the regulation of estrogen and androgen levels [62–64]. In rice field eel, the expression of 17β-hsd12 was stage-specific, which was more abundant in females while barely detected in males according to our data set, and was supported by qPCR.Genes related to lysosome pathway were kept down-regulated from ovary through ovotestis to testis according to our dataset. This probably because that lysosome plays a key role in the development of fish oocyte [65], and this down-regulation might be one of the main reasons that caused ovary degeneration.We screened out 19 candidate genes that could be most related genes to the sex reversal process, and part of their expression were verified by qPCR. Such as, the dmc1 is required for homologous chromosome synapsis during meiosis in both mammals and fishes [66, 67], while the spef2 and spag6 were both found crucial to spermatogenesis and flagellar assembly [68, 69]. The 17β-hsd12, a member of the hydroxysteroid (17β) dehydrogenase superfamily which could affect the reproductive system by involving the metabolism of sexual hormones, was found playing an important role in ovarian function, meiosis and regulation of fertility[70]. Although several of these candidate genes were not deeply studied in fish yet, their roles in the sex reversal process could not be neglected according to their expression patterns. Besides this, it is worth noticed that although there were thousands of genes with unequal expression patterns through sex stages, most of them were not (directly) related with the sex determination or gonad development process, and some were with considerably high expression level. Those genes involved in basal metabolism could also be of great importance during sex transformation. Genes with crucial function and gonad development involved, however, usually maintained a relatively low abundance. Thus there should be more pathways that could affect the sex reversal process, and further comprehensive studies were needed.We provide a comprehensive study of the rice field eel transcriptome of brain and gonad tissue in three sex stages. Our data produced over 195 thousand unigenes and 44,445 were annotated. Comparative study between stages provided multiple differentially expression genes in brain and gonad tissue, which could be candidates involved in sex reversal. Gene expression profiling reveals the relationship between enriched pathways and sex stages.

In the physiological experiments, sex reversal rates increased continuously in proportion to TB concentrations (2–100 ng/L), and were 100% (all males) in the 200 ng/L treatment group. TB caused a significant increase in the gonadosomatic index of females at concentrations of 60 and 100 ng/L. These females exhibited swollen abdomens and decreased egg production and fertility. Significant increases were observed in the body mass index of these females. TB caused decreased fertility in males at concentrations >20 ng/L, but no other effects were observed. In the transcriptomic (microarray) experiments, larvae were exposed to TB for up to 7 d. Analyses using the KEGG Orthology Database revealed that predominant categories of significantly upregulated genes included “lipid metabolism” and “metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides.” Thirteen genes (including those for hydroxymethylglutaryl‐CoA synthase, cytoplasmic synthase, and lanosterol synthase) related to cholesterol biosynthesis via the mevalonate pathway were highlighted in these categories. Reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction analyses were consistent with the microarray results, in terms of the direction and magnitude of change to gene expression. Among the downregulated genes, angiopoietin‐like 4 and mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1, which are inversely correlated with obesity, were detected in the TB treatments. In conclusion, the results suggest that the exposure of females to TB during the early life stage may cause metabolic dysfunctions, including obesity and disrupted cholesterol synthesis. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, Dmrt1 respectively becomes detectable at Stage 36 and 5 days post hatching (dph) in the two strains. In XX HNI-II embryos, 17α-methyltestosterone (MT) induces Gsdf mRNA from Stage 36, accompanied by complete sex-reversal in all treated individuals (MT, 10 ng/mL), while Dmrt1 mRNA was first detectable at 5 dph.

More recently perchlorate has been shown to affect primordial sexual differentiation in the aquatic model fishes zebrafish and threespine stickleback, but the mechanism has been unclear. Stickleback exposed to perchlorate from fertilization have increased androgen levels in the embryo and disrupted reproductive morphologies as adults, suggesting that perchlorate could disrupt the earliest stages of primordial sexual differentiation when primordial germ cells (PGCs) begin to form the gonad. Female stickleback have three to four times the number of PGCs as males during the first weeks of development. We hypothesized that perchlorate exposure affects primordial sexual differentiation by reducing the number of germ cells in the gonad during an important window of stickleback sex determination at 14–18 days post fertilization (dpf). We tested this hypothesis by quantifying the number of PGCs at 16 dpf in control and 100 mg/L perchlorate-treated male and female stickleback. Perchlorate exposure from the time of fertilization resulted in significantly reduced PGC number only in genotypic females, suggesting that the masculinizing effects of perchlorate observed in adult stickleback may result from early changes to the number of PGCs at a time critical for sex determination. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of a connection between an endocrine disruptor and reduction in PGC number prior to the first meiosis during sex determination. These findings suggest that a mode of action of perchlorate on adult reproductive phenotypes in vertebrates, including humans, such as altered fecundity and sex reversal or intersex gonads, may stem from early changes to germ cell development.Citation: Petersen AM, Earp NC, Redmond ME, Postlethwait JH, von Hippel FA, Buck CL, et al.

This small molecule has been linked to a variety of developmental abnormalities associated with hypothyroidism in humans, including reduced cognitive function [2, 3]. Experimental exposure to perchlorate alters development and morphology of thyroid follicles in model organisms such as fish [4–6] and mice [7]. Perchlorate exposure in teleost fishes leads to a wide array of altered phenotypes, some of which suggest organizational effects during development in addition to activational effects on the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Thyroid (HPT) axis [4, 8–11]. Perchlorate exposure has negative effects on health and survivorship of vertebrates at environmentally relevant concentrations, usually in the range of parts per billion [12, 13], and in some parts of Texas, USA, levels have been measured in surface waters in the parts per million range [14].In addition to its effects on thyroid development and function, perchlorate also appears to act through an unknown mechanism to alter gonad development and sex determination in teleost fishes, a finding not predicted to occur solely via thyroid disruption [4, 6, 8, 11, 15]. Changes to reproductive development include increased androgen levels in larvae and adults, increased spermatogenesis, decreased oocyte maturation [6], and disruption of reproductive behaviors [16]. Perchlorate masculinizes the gonad in male and female threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus; hereafter ‘stickleback’), in addition to increasing the gonadal-somatic index in male stickleback [6, 8]. In some cases, perchlorate exposure causes genotypically female stickleback to develop into functional hermaphrodites [8]. Exposure to perchlorate in the first 42 days post fertilization (dpf) causes abnormalities in development of thyroid and reproductive systems in adult stickleback, suggesting early critical windows of development in which this chemical exerts lasting effects into adulthood [4, 10]. Perchlorate also affects sexual differentiation in zebrafish (Danio rerio), a species in which different strains are reported to have varying or no genetic bases for sex determination [17–19]. In contrast to our findings in stickleback, exposure of zebrafish to perchlorate during early development skews the sex ratio towards female [15], suggesting some species-specific effects of perchlorate on sexual development.Although perchlorate affects sexual differentiation in the stickleback and zebrafish teleost models, the mechanisms underlying the observed effects are unknown. In particular, it is not clear how perchlorate might affect the earliest stages of sexual differentiation, such as initial gonad organogenesis. In this study, we examine whether the earliest known morphological marker of sex determination in stickleback, primordial germ cell (PGC) number, is affected by perchlorate exposure beginning at fertilization. Specifically, we examine whether perchlorate alters sex determination and reproductive development by affecting proliferation or survival of the PGCs during early development. PGC development is one of the first tractable morphological events in vertebrates, occurring by either preformation or epigenesis, with both modes of specification found within teleosts [20].Once they are specified, germ cells undergo several rounds of mitosis [21–23] and then migrate to the site of the presumptive gonad. At this point, the gonad is bipotential, with the capacity to become either ovary or testis. In many teleosts, including stickleback, the germ cells then begin to mitotically divide at a sex specific rate [24]. The underlying genetic signals and morphological changes that transform the bipotential gonads into either ovaries or testes vary widely among species [25]. The first sex-specific event in the developing gonad of many species is a second wave of several rounds of mitosis.Genotypic female stickleback exhibit a larger and earlier second wave of mitosis than males at approximately 15 dpf, which results in three to four times more germ cells [24]. Between 15 and 18 dpf, germ cells in females undergo a round of apoptosis, with females having five times the number of apoptotic germ cells as males [24]. Following meiosis at approximately 18 to 20 dpf, females still have more germ cells than males, although the difference between the sexes is not as dramatic due to the large pre-meiotic apoptosis in the female germ cell population that occurs in the time period leading up to 18 dpf. In addition, the timing of the second wave of mitosis and meiosis of germ cells is earlier in female mammals such as mice [26] and humans [27].This program of germ cell development is common to differentiation during sex determination of the primordial germ line in many teleosts including zebrafish [28–30], as well as in some other vertebrates [27] and represents one of the earliest sex specific, morphologically identifiable events in vertebrate development. For example, PGCs of male mouse embryos enter mitotic arrest at 13.5 dpf, whereas female PGCs continue to proliferate for an additional 24 hours before entering arrest [25, 31]. Intriguingly, when germ cells are ablated in medaka and zebrafish (strain AB) embryos, the modified fish all subsequently develop as males [29, 32, 33] suggesting that a lack of pre-oocyte signaling to the surrounding somatic tissue leads to a testis fate. Transplanting additional germ cells to the gonad reveals that a certain threshold of germ cells must be reached in zebrafish to maintain female identity and for the gonad to develop into an ovary [33]. Mutant zebrafish that develop and reproduce as females can, after germ cell loss at five months due to a mutation in nanos3, become males capable of forming functional sperm [34]. The current hypothesis for this outcome in zebrafish is that meiotic germ cells signal the gonadal somatic cells to maintain expression of aromatase, which converts testosterone to estrogen, causing the gonad to develop into an ovary and the fish to become a female [29, 30, 34, 35]. Reduction in germ cells due to the nanos3 mutation therefore leads to a sex reversal from female to male in these zebrafish. Collectively, these data suggest a hypothesis that in vertebrates timing and magnitude of germ cell mitosis and meiosis, and therefore germ cell number, are critical drivers of reproductive development, including sex determination.Here we use the stickleback fish model to address a potential cellular mechanism by which perchlorate influences reproductive development in vertebrates. We hypothesize that perchlorate exposure affects germ cell proliferation. We predict that the previously documented masculinizing effects of perchlorate exposure early in stickleback development would manifest as fewer germ cells in females, with numbers more similar to those observed in genotypic male stickleback [24]. We tested this hypothesis by exposing stickleback to environmentally relevant concentrations of perchlorate (100 mg/L) [36, 37], and counted premeiotic, meiotic, and total number of germ cells at 16 dpf, the earliest sex-specific difference in morphology in the stickleback gonad [24]. We exposed embryos to perchlorate-treated water from the time of fertilization until 16 dpf and counted germ cell number to test if perchlorate changes the magnitude of the second wave of mitosis. We found that perchlorate exposure decreases primordial germ cell number in female stickleback at 16 dpf, a time when genetic signaling cascades involving germ cell number are important to sex determination. Our findings suggest a cellular mechanism for the patterns of gonadal dysgenesis that we previously reported in perchlorate treated juveniles and adults.Anadromous stickleback were collected from Eel Creek, Oregon (43°35′N; 124°11′W) for parental stock to develop a laboratory line. These collections were covered by Oregon Scientific Take Permit # OR2007-3495, issued by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. The district biologist was contacted and approved of this sampling. No endangered or protected species were encountered during this sampling. However, the limited take of endangered salmonids (if encountered) was covered under the permit mentioned above. All collection, embryo production, and lab rearing methods were approved by the University of Oregon Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Protocol # 10–16. Stickleback were captured using minnow traps, and embryos were created by combining eggs with macerated testes in a Petri dish. Embryos were then transferred back to the lab and reared for multiple generations. All collection, embryo production, and lab rearing methods were approved by the University of Oregon Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Protocol # 10–16. All wild fish sampling procedures were proposed and approved upon applying and being rewarded with the sampling permit. Fish used in this study were the fourth and fifth generation of this line and were fertilized, hatched, and reared using standard crossing protocols [38]. At the onset of this study, fertilized, lab-reared clutches were divided evenly between control and perchlorate-exposure conditions to remove any effects of genetic background. Embryos and fry of all ages were maintained in 6 ppt Instant Ocean (Aquarium Systems, Mentor, OH) added to reverse osmosis water at a constant temperature of 20°C. Embryos and fry were raised under 12:12 light:dark cycle in glass 150 mm Petri dishes at a density of no more than 50 individuals/Petri dish (approximately 100 mL embryo medium), with daily water changes and removal of any dead or sick individuals. Sodium perchlorate hydrate (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added to perchlorate-exposure dishes at a concentration of 100 mg/L (ppm), a concentration previously found to cause reproductive abnormalities in stickleback [6]. Both control and perchlorate treated water were changed daily until the end of the experiment (16dpf). After hatching (around 6 to 7 dpf), fry were fed live Artemia spp. (Inve Aquaculture, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT). Animal care, experimental methods, and euthanasia protocols were approved by the University of Oregon Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Protocol # 10-16R.Thirty stickleback were euthanized at 16 dpf with neutral pH MS222 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and immediately fixed in Bouin’s solution and then placed at 4°C for 48 h. After Bouin’s fixation, fish were serially dehydrated in ETOH washes of increasing concentration, and then stored in 70% ETOH at 4°C. Samples were subsequently paraffin-embedded and sectioned sagittally through the gonad-containing portion of the abdomen to visualize the gonads at 8 μm resolution, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The University of Oregon Histology and Genetic Modification (HGeM) Core Facility performed sectioning and staining.Sagittal sections covered one to five slides (Starfrost) depending upon the size of the fry. Slides containing a 16 dpf fish resulted in approximately 30 sections. In 8 μm thick sections, it is possible to see multiple layers of cells in different focal planes. We counted PGCs at 400-600X under bright field illumination on every section that had visible gonad using a Nikon Eclipse Ti. PGCs were distinguishable by their size, shape, and location within the developing gonad (Fig 1). The entire gonad was sectioned into 10–37 sections, depending on the size of the gonad and the age of the fish. Only PGCs over 5 μm wide were counted and then classified as meiotic or premeiotic, to avoid recounting the same PGC that might span two sections, since the PGCs are spheres and therefore will be smaller than maximum width in consecutive sections. Premeiotic cells were distinguished from meiotic cells using the criteria of Lewis et al. (2008). Specifically, premeiotic cells were identified by size—premeiotic cells are typically twice the size—and by the presence of an un-condensed nucleus with an irregular nuclear membrane. PGC counts were tallied and analyzed based on treatment and sex genotype.Scale bars are 100 microns. White arrows denote location of PGCs within the gonad. At 16 dpf, number of PGCs in control male stickleback (A) were not different than in male stickleback raised in 100 mg/L perchlorate (B). At 16 dpf, however, control female stickleback (C) had more PGCs than females raised in 100 mg/L perchlorate (D).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0157792.g001A standard sex genotyping protocol for stickleback was followed as described previously [39, 40]. Briefly, caudal fin was digested and DNA extracted using Qiagen DNAeasy kits. Primers described by Griffiths et al. 2000 (Primer 1 Forward 5’CTTCTTTCCTCACCATACTCA, Primer 1 Reverse 5’AGATGACGGGTTGATAAACAG) were used to amplify sex specific regions of DNA, and the resulting bands were visualized using standard gel electrophoresis protocols.Analyses of all data were performed using JMP PRO software (2013 SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Means presented are +/- 1 SE. Comparisons of means for PGC number were analyzed using a two factor factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) (effect of perchlorate treatment and sex on germ cell number), followed by Tukey’s HSD post-hoc analysis of means for significant treatment effects, after testing for statistical assumptions. Critical α = 0.05.Pathohistological analysis of serially sectioned abdomens of 16 dpf stickleback revealed easily discernable PGCs in control males (Fig 1A) and females (Fig 1C) that were located in the cavity between the gut and the dorsal skeletal muscle. Female stickleback of this age appeared to have more PGCs in the bipotential gonad than males of the same age (Fig 1A and 1C). For stickleback raised in 100 mg/L perchlorate, females and males appeared to have approximately equal numbers of PGCs in the gonad (Fig 1B and 1D). The histological analysis did not reveal any other gross differences in the developing gonad at these ages between males and females, or between treated and control fish (Fig 1).To confirm histological observations, we counted the number of PGCs in entire gonads. Control 16 dpf males had a mean of 77 +/- 13.9 SE PGCs in the gonad, while control females had a mean of 163 +/- 31.8 SE PGCs (Fig 2A, S1 Data). A two-factor factorial ANOVA overall model effect confirmed a significant effect on PGC number for both sex (F3, 22 = 2.6, P = 0.0165) and perchlorate treatment (F3, 22 = 3.88, P = 0.0008), and a significant interaction effect of the two levels (F3, 22 = 7.23, P = 0.0015). Females exposed to perchlorate from fertilization to 16 dpf had significantly fewer (1/3 as many) total PGCs as control females, but perchlorate did not affect PGC number in males, explaining the interaction between perchlorate treatment and sex factors in the ANOVA model (Fig 2, S1 Data).Number of PGCs (+/-1SE) in 16 dpf genotypic male (solid lines) and female (dotted lines) stickleback, with interaction plots of the total number of PGCs (A), premeiotic PGCs (B), and meiotic cells (C). Asterisk represents significantly different PGC counts (Two-Way ANOVA, Tukey's Post-Hoc Analysis, P< 0.05). n = 12–14.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0157792.g002We categorized germ cells as either premeiotic or meiotic. In control female 16 dpf stickleback, a mean of 142.8 PGCs (88% of total) were premeiotic, while 12% had entered or completed meiosis (Fig 2B, S1 Data). In control male 16 dpf stickleback, a mean of 70.5 PGCs (92% of total) were premeiotic, with the remaining 8% meiotic (Fig 2C, S1 Data). The percent of PGCs that were premeiotic did not change with perchlorate treatment. In perchlorate treated 16 dpf females, a mean of 48.8 PGCs (88%) were premeiotic, and in perchlorate treated 16 dpf males 91% were premeiotic. At 16 dpf, perchlorate treatment results in a significant decline in both premeiotic (F3, 22 = 7.07, P = 0.0017) and meiotic (F3, 22 = 6.98, P = 0.0018) germ cell number only in females.Stickleback are an established model system for testing the effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals relevant to human health [41, 42]. Using this model fish we found that perchlorate significantly reduces PGC number in female stickleback at 16 dpf, an important time in gonad development and possibly sex determination in this species [24]. The reduction in PGC number in genotypic females caused by perchlorate may explain how it masculinizes them, an effect that appears to have lasting consequences to the health and development of the adult fish. Our findings are one of the first reports of an endocrine disrupting contaminant affecting germ cell number in a developing vertebrate, an effect that might occur due to exposure to other contaminants as well. Our findings also underscore the utility of this model fish for ecotoxicology studies, and our results are likely extendible to other vertebrates. PGC number is the first tractable sex specific morphology in the developing gonad of many vertebrates [24, 29, 43, 44] and genetic signaling cascades from the larger number of meiotic germ cells in genotypic females drives female-specific cell fate in many teleosts [29, 30, 45] but interestingly not goldfish [46]. A gene important to male medaka sex determination, Dmrt1bY, inhibits germ cell proliferation, further suggesting that germ cell number during gonad development is closely linked to the sex determination process [43, 47].The absolute numbers of PGCs we count differ from the findings of Lewis et al. (2008), which also examined PGC development in stickleback. In addition, we identify meiotic germ cells in females at 16dpf, as well as a few (5 or less on average) in males at this age (Fig 2). Lewis et al.(23)did not identify meiotic cells in either sex until 18dpf, although in that study no measurements were taken between 15dpf and 18dpf, making direct comparison impossible. In the current study, we examined an anadromous population of stickleback from Eel Creek in Oregon, while Lewis et al. (23 examined two Alaskan populations of stickleback from Rabbit Slough (anadromous) and Bear Paw Lake (resident freshwater). In the anadromous Alaskan population, Lewis et al. [24] counted up to ten times more PGCs in similarly aged fish. However, the resident freshwater population Lewis et al. [24] had PGC numbers more closely matched to the numbers we report here. The similarities and differences in the findings of these two studies raise the interesting possibility of population-specific patterns of germ cell development. Some plausible reasons for the differences between the studies include our use of a conservative quantification rubric to avoid counting the same cell twice, population level differences in developmental trajectories, and environmental factors such as temperature, salinity, and food availability causing different developmental patterns. A multi-population study of patterns of germ cell development across stickleback ecotypes would provide the necessary data to answer these questions. Population-level differences could also be exploited in genetic mapping studies to identify additional genes and pathways important for germ cell development, further underscoring the useful role for threespine stickleback as an evolutionary mutant model [48] for biomedical studies.Our findings suggest that environmental perchlorate exposure early in life may be interfering with reproductive development during sex determination in exposed vertebrates. Germ cell number in carp has also been demonstrated to be affected by exposure to an estrogen mimic [49], but our data are the first to demonstrate an effect of a non-steroidal compound that is commonly found in drinking water sources. Early embryonic exposure to some pollutants causes lasting effects on adult reproductive morphology or performance in vertebrates [50–52] in addition to cancers [53–55] and other pathologies such as immunotoxic effects in the head kidney [56]. Some of these effects are transgenerational [55, 57], and an exciting area of research is on epigenetic mechanisms of inheritance of environmental exposure to pollutants. Perchlorate is well documented to disrupt the function of the thyroid with consequences to the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis [58–60], and perchlorate impacts health and development in ways that go beyond those easily interpretable as mediated via the thyroid. Many pollutants alter reproductive development, including ovarian follicle formation in mice [61], oocyte development in white suckers (Catostomus commersoni) [62], and spermatogenesis in stickleback [6]. The current study is one of the first to examine whether a known endocrine disruptor impacts reproductive development by affecting proliferation or survival of the PGCs prior to meiosis.Although our data show that perchlorate clearly affects PGC number at 16 dpf in female stickleback (Figs 1 and 2), the molecular and physiological mechanisms are as yet unknown. Many pollutants, including perchlorate, cause adult gonad dysgenesis and pathology via effects on hormonal systems. Endocrine disruption by exogenous pollutants can alter gonad size [11, 12, 15], gonad shape [63], and reproductive development and behavior [8, 62]. We previously found that perchlorate masculinizes both adult male and female stickleback[6, 8], leading to the hypothesis that perchlorate can have androgenic effects. In a recent study [6], we found a significant effect of a range of doses of perchlorate on embryonic, larval, and juvenile levels of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT). 11-KT is a key androgen in teleost fishes for stimulating male reproductive physiology [64, 65], and is synthesized from testosterone. Changes in embryonic 11-KT levels occurred within hours of perchlorate exposure [6]. Changes in the steroid environment in the embryo based on perchlorate exposure is therefore a possible mechanistic explanation for our finding in the current study that PGC number is reduced in perchlorate-treated females, but not in males. In tilapia, steroid-producing cells congregate near the differentiating germ cells, suggesting that steroids perform a role in the process of germ cell differentiation [66]. Androgens contribute to germ cell determination and follicular atresia in mice [67, 68]. Exposure of mice to environmental estrogens increases the occurrence of follicles containing multiple oocytes, which is a marker of disrupted germ cell development [61].These results are consistent with the hypothesis that perchlorate disrupts PGC development by altering embryonic steroid levels (Fig 2). Perchlorate could reduce total PGC number in females by either reducing proliferation (mitosis) or by increasing the rate of cell death (apoptosis). Future studies should test these hypotheses using molecular markers of proliferation and apoptosis in perchlorate-treated and control fish. Quantifying PGC number across a span of development would be an important experiment to address these possibilities. Critical time periods of exposure have been detected for endocrine disrupting compounds, usually early in embryonic development [53, 69]. Chemical exposure is thought to explain numerous adult-onset human diseases [70, 71]. By 16 dpf, the second round of PGC mitosis has already occurred in stickleback, and females have measurably more PGCs than males. By 18 dpf, PGCs in control stickleback are entering into meiosis and differentiating into male or female reproductive cells, and between 16 and 18 dpf female stickleback experience a 5-fold increase in apoptotic cells, reducing germ cell number to a level close to that of males [24]. Our data suggest that perchlorate exerts effects on early stages of germ cell development, resulting in reproductive pathologies in adults [6, 10, 12].Perchlorate is a widespread aquatic contaminant in certain countries such as the United States, where nearly every person has measurable levels of perchlorate in their urine [72]. Here we demonstrate that perchlorate has effects on reproductive development by significantly reducing PGC number in female stickleback at 16 dpf, an important period of germ cell development and proliferation. Future studies should determine the mechanism by which perchlorate reduces PGC number, and whether this effect is widespread across vertebrates and therefore has implications for wildlife reproductive health. Because of the conservation of many aspects of germ cell production across vertebrates, our findings may also have significant implications for human health. In humans, disruption of endocrine function during early developmental windows can cause adult-onset diseases [73]. Our findings support the ‘developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis’ (DOHaD), which suggests that some adult human diseases arise from prenatal exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds [70, 74]. Our findings are likely applicable to the wide array of vertebrates in which germ cell number is an important early indicator of sex determination, including other teleosts and mammals. Environmental contaminants can cause primordial sexual dysgenesis in humans and may contribute to widespread diseases such as polycystic ovarian syndrome and breast cancer [74, 75]. Studies of model organisms such as stickleback have the potential to help in understanding–and eventually mitigating–these effects, by offering insights into mechanisms of action of contaminants that lead to pathology.Raw counts of primordial germ cells in 16dpf threespine stickleback from Oregon.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0157792.s001(XLSX)We thank Poh Kheng Loi for expertise in histology preparations, and Ruth Bremiller, Yi-Lin Yan, and Catherine Wilson for helpful discussion and technical expertise.

Here, we used a novel RNAi to characterise the molecular mechanism of Dmy (the sex-determining gene of medaka)-mediated masculinity in XY fish. Dmy knockdown (Dmy-KD) suppressed male pathway (Gsdf, Sox9a2, etc.) and favoured female cascade (Rspo1, etc.) in embryonic XY gonads, resulting in a fertile male-to-female sex-reversal. Gsdf, Sox9a2 and Rspo1 directly interacted with Dmy and co-injection of Gsdf and Sox9a2 re-established masculinity in XY-Dmy-KD transgenics, insinuating that Dmy initiates masculinity by stimulating and suppressing Gsdf/Sox9a2 and Rspo1 expression, respectively. Gonadal expression of Wt1a starts prior to Dmy and didn’t change upon Dmy-KD. Furthermore, Wt1a stimulated the promoter activity of Dmy, suggesting Wt1a as a regulator of Dmy. These findings provide new insights into the role of vertebrate sex-determining genes associated with the molecular interplay between the male and female pathways.Sex determination is the process that determines the sex of an organism. The signals that control this decision are usually categorized as genetic or environmental. In the genetic sex determination, four master sex-determining genes have been previously identified: SRY/Sry, most mammals including humans1; Dmy/Dmrt1Y, medaka2,3; Dmrt1, chicken4; Dm-W, Xenopus laevis5. More recently, novel autosomal sex-determining genes were reported in five teleost species: Amhy, Odontesthes hatcheri6; Gsdf, Oryzias luzonensis7; Amhr2, Takifugu rubripes8; SdY, Oncorhynchus mykiss9 and Sox3, Oryzias dancena10. In the past decade, it has become clear that although the upstream sex-determining signals are diverse, they often act through more ancient downstream regulatory hierarchies11.Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) is one of the best-studied species among non-mammalian vertebrates with respect to sex determination and differentiation. Sex determination in medaka is strictly genetic, with a male heterogametic (XX/XY) system2. The testicular morphogenesis in medaka is clearly distinctive from the ovarian morphogenesis during the early stages of gonadal differentiation12. It is generally accepted that the number of germ cells, more specifically the proliferative mitosis and subsequent occurrence of meiosis in females and mitotic arrest in males by the day of hatching, are the first sign of morphological sex differentiation in medaka12. Thus, the day of hatching is an important time point on which the morphological sex differentiation becomes apparent in the medaka XY and XX gonads not only in the form of germ cell proliferation, but also meiosis. Furthermore, in the QurtE strain of Japanese medaka, genetic sex of the embryos can be identified by the presence or absence of leucophores on the head region from 2 days after fertilization (daf)13. Leucophores are present in the head region of XY embryos but not in XX embryos13.In medaka, the Y chromosome harbours the master sex-determining gene (primary testis determinant), Dmy/Dmrt1bY2,3. A mutation due to a single nucleotide insertion in the exon 3 of Dmy ORF leads to a truncated Dmy, which gives rise to spontaneous sex reversed XY female medaka2,14. The overexpression of Dmy resulted in the induction of testis differentiation and subsequent male development in XX (genetically female) medaka. Moreover, gripNA induced knockdown of Dmy by our group15 showed signs of increased germ cell number and meiotic progression, as early as hatching day (indicators of feminization) in XY medaka. However, no studies have yet revealed the course of action of Dmy on somatic and germ cells that induces the male sexual differentiation. Although several male-associated genes like Gsdf (gonadal soma derived factor, a unique member of the TGF-β family)16, Sox9a2 (also known as Sox9b, the orthologue of tetrapod Sox9)17,18 and Dmrt119 have been suggested to be downstream of Dmy, no specific targets have been identified for Dmy. On the contrary, even though the key ovary determinant in medaka has not been defined, R-spondins, estrogen receptor β2 (ERβ2) and Foxl2 have been shown to express specifically in XX gonads during sex determination and differentiation20,21,22,23.Although several fish sex-determining genes have been identified by now, no elaborate knockdown study of these sex-determining genes is available. Therefore, it is of critical importance to study the effect of reduced Dmy expression on sex differentiation and maturation in medaka. Although ZFN/TALEN/CRISPER-based knockouts are gaining popularity, each one has their own advantages and disadvantages24. Antisense (AS) RNA has long been considered a promising technique for treating disease25. There are several mechanisms by which AS RNA may exert its effect, such as de-stabilization of endogenous mRNA26, production of small RNAs27 and activation of the siRNA/miRNA pathway27,28. Medaka and zebrafish (Danio rario) are excellent models for studying developmental processes, because of several advantages over higher vertebrates. For example, these egg-laying teleosts are small, have a rapid generation time and produce large number of offsprings. Also, their external fertilization and well-documented developmental processes makes gene manipulation studies much easier to perform. In the present study using medaka, we have developed an AS DNA vector-based approach to overcome the shortcomings of the effect of Dmy knockdown. Upon knockdown of Dmy, we were successful in generating a functional sex-reversed XY medaka with full fertilization potential. The gonadal sex reversal mechanism in medaka was associated with simultaneous suppression and induction of downstream male-associated and female-associated genes, respectively.The present study used a 220 bp antisense DMY construct (neighbouring the DM domain) expressing short AS-RNA (Supplementary Fig. 1), which was designed and evaluated using E-RNAi (http://www.dkfz.de/signaling/e-rnai3//), to silence the Dmy gene in medaka. Gene specificity and possible off-target effects of the pmDMY-AS-construct on the downstream genes Dmrt1, Sox9a2, Gsdf and Sf1 were studied in cell cultures co-transfected with pCMV-DMY, pCMV-DMRT1, pCMV-SOX9a2, pCMV-GSDF and pCMV-SF1. Dose-dependent suppression of the Dmy (92% at 100 ng group) and Dmrt1 (43.75% at 100 ng group) transcript were documented in this experiment. However, the expression of the other three genes (Sox9a2, Gsdf and Sf1) remained unaffected (Fig. 1A).In vitro and in vivo validation of knockdown strategy.(A) In vitro validation. The specificity and off target effects of pmDMY-AS construct was validated in vitro using COS7 cells via co-transfection of pmDMY-AS construct and the ORF plasmids of either Dmy (specific, solid circles), Dmrt1 (partially specific, solid squared), Sox9a2 (non-specific, grey circles) Gsdf (non specific, open circles) or Sf1 (non specific, open squared). The mean absolute copy numbers of respective gene per 5 ng of RNA are plotted in the graph along with SEM. The significance is indicated by a, b, c, in which different letters indicate the significant difference from other group at p < 0.05. (B,C) In vivo validation. Olvas-eGFP medaka were electroporated with pEGFP-AS plasmid (carries an antisense eGFP sequence) and continuous microscopic visualization (from 3days after fertilization (daf) to 5 days after hatching (dah)) of GFP expression in individual embryos was performed to ascertain the changes of GFP production in control (B, 6 daf) and pEGFP-KD (pEGFP-AS electroporated) groups (C, 6 daf). (D,E) Sharp fall in Gfp mRNA production was assessed through real-time PCR at 20 dah (days after hatching). Non-specific effects of pEGFP-AS construct were analysed by measuring the mRNA amount of Dmy, Dmrt1, Spo11 and ERα. Data are presented as both individual values (with dots and triangles) and mean of 10 individual (white and grey columns for control and knockdown groups, respectively) fish of each sex.To confirm the knockdown effect of the AS technique in vivo, Gfp expression was knocked down in olvas-eGFP transgenic medaka (expresses GFP in the germ cells) one-two cell stage embryos29 by electroporation, using a pEGFP-AS plasmid (contains 320 bp antisense GFP sequence and expected to knockdown the GFP expression)30. Microscopic observations from 3 daf indicated a reduction of Gfp expression in gonads of electroporated embryos compared to negative controls (Fig. 1B,C). Real-time PCR using 20 dah (days after hatching) XX and XY fish demonstrated unchanged expression of other genes including Dmy, Gsdf, Dmrt1, Spo11 and estrogen receptor (ER) α (Fig. 1D,E). A group of pEGFP- knockdown (KD) fish was raised to adulthood to check whether the present method had some effect on gonad maintenance and secondary sexual character development in the long run. No side effect was observed with reference to growth and development of secondary sexual characteristics (Supplementary Table 1).Our knockdown strategy is expected to transcribe AS RNA, which might be cleaved by endogenous RNA processing machineries (e.g., dicer, RNaseH, etc.) and produce a pronounced knockdown effect. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of knockdown action, small-RNAs were isolated from sex-reversed F1 generation fish (mentioned later in detail) of Dmy knockdown (Dmy-KD) group. Northern blotting (using same 220 bp Dmy fragment as a probe) detected a strong signal at 60 base (b) and a weak signal in the 18–28 b region, only in Dmy-KD lane samples (Supplementary Fig. 2). Cloning and sequencing analysis (details in Supplementary Materials and Methods) of these bands revealed several fragments of both 60–70 b and 18–28 b were derived from the long Dmy AS sequence (Supplementary Fig. 2) and rest were randomly distributed throughout the Dmy mRNA sequence. We also sequenced the larger fragments (>100 bp size fragments) to find out any evidence for alternative splicing associated transcriptional rate inhibition. Both control-XY and Dmy-KD-XY fish had similar pattern of large RNA (>600 bp) fragmentation except the fact that, only Dmy-KD samples contained a trail for different size samples (most of them had portion of ORF/5UTR/3UTR but none showed any evidence for alternative splicing, especially for intronic sequences, joined or duplicated exons) and relative occurrence of full ORF was also significantly less (1/123.4 clones) than their control counterpart (1/4.7 clones). These observations suggest that the AS RNA-expressing construct mainly destabilizes the mRNA probably via small interfering RNA (siRNA)/micro RNA (miRNA) pathway to block the expression of Dmy (Supplementary Fig. 2D).To test the above hypothesis about mode of knockdown, three representative shDNA (small hairpin DNA, each of 38 bp) were artificially synthesized using a Block-it™ pol II miR RNAi expression vector kit (Invitrogen, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Precautions were taken while designing the shDNA constructs in order to make sure that all three shDNA fragments did not overlap each other and also belonged from the same targeted 220 bp Dmy region (used to prepare the pmDMY-AS construct). All these shDNA plasmids (pmCMV-DMYsh1, pmCMV-DMYsh2 and pmCMV-DMYsh3) were electroporated in one or two-cell medaka embryos in all possible combinations. pmDMY-AS and pEGFP-AS were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Despite Dmy knockdown, the singularly injected pmCMV-DMYsh1, 2 or 3 specimens failed to show any significant phenotypic effect in terms of increased meiosis (Supplementary Table 2). The occurrence of mitosis and meiosis in male gonads increased approximately 2 fold upon double knockdown of pmCMV-DMYsh1 and 2. Triple knockdown using three short hairpin constructs, pmCMV-DMYsh1, 2 and 3, gave maximum knockdown comparable with pmDMY-KD (Supplementary Table 2). This suggests that, our pmDMY-AS construct reduces the mRNA stability and produces several small RNA, which in turn amplifies the knockdown effect.After checking the knockdown efficiency by real-time PCR analysis of several sex related genes including Dmy (discussed later), gonadal histology of Dmy-KD XY embryos was performed to assess the changes at the phenotypic level caused by Dmy suppression. Cells in early stages of meiosis were observed in XY gonads even at 0 dah and gradually increased at 5 and 10 dah (Fig. 2A–D). To observe the duration of the silencing effect, the electroporated XY fish were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE) at 50 dah (Fig. 2E–G). 50% of the fish were found to have fully grown ovaries containing variable numbers of oocytes, while 20% had testicular tissue in the gonad (Supplementary Table 3).Effect of Dmy knockdown on gonad development.(A) The total number of mitotic germ cells counted (control XX, white; Dmy-KD XY, grey; control XY, black) at 5 dah (5H) and 10 dah (10H), was used as a marker for gonadal sex. Data are presented as mean of 10 individuals from both control and Dmy-KD groups. Error bars indicate SEM. Letters (a-c) above the bars indicate that these groups differ significantly (p < 0.05) from each other. (B–G) The candidate HE-stained sections of control XX females (B,E), control XY males (C,F) and Dmy-KD XY fish (D,G). Female-like gonad development is seen in Dmy-KD XY fish, which later forms a fully developed ovary. Note: B, C and D represent gonads at 10 dah, while E, F and G represent gonadal structure at 50 dah. (H,I) Dmy knockdown directed femininity was persistent during adulthood, which was confirmed by female-like external appearances (H) and gonad structure (I). The femininity was further confirmed by ISH with female (Cyp19a1, J; Foxl2, L; Rspo1, N) and male (Dmy, K; Cyp11a, M); Cyp11b, O) associated genes. (Scale bars, 20 μm.)Further, genotyping was carried out and the sex-reversed Dmy-KD XY F0 females (Fig. 2H,I) were raised to maturity and five individuals were mated with normal males to test their mating and breeding ability. Although all the five F0 fish gave rise to viable progeny, complete AS construct was integrated into the genome of two specimens (here after considered as founder fish), as evidenced by the amplification of the transgene sequence (using a vector specific forward primer and a Dmy fragment specific reverse primer) from genomic DNA isolated from caudal fin clips (data not shown). We did not find any significant differences between progenies from these two founder fish (Supplementary Table 4). Hence, the progenies generated from these two F0 phenotypic females were used for further analysis.In two specimens of F1 generation fish (out of ten checked by HE staining), meiotic cells were detected at 10 dah stage, which indicated that the antisense Dmy transgene (CMV-DmyAS) had passed to the next generation. However, the low level of gene transmission might be associated with the crossing method, where control XY fish were used as male partner. The remaining F1 progeny were raised to adulthood till the development of secondary sexual characters. Three sex reversed XY females (confirmed by the presence of male-specific leucophore (Y linked character) and Dmy-transgene amplification) from the F1 group were similarly analysed for mating and breeding behaviour. All tested fish were fully fertile and further mated to produce viable progeny (Supplementary Table 3). Similar analyses were performed in each generation before mating the animals for progeny production. The fecundity (egg number) of the Dmy-KD XY females was also quite similar to that of control XX females in different generations (from F2-F5, Supplementary table 5). We used the F3 fish to generate pmDMY-KD line in which the Dmy mRNA expression was very low (measured by real-time PCR in embryonic gonads) from early development period.To determine the effect of Dmy knockdown, real-time PCR was performed using samples from 5 daf (days after fertilization) to adulthood. As expected, at early stages, transient Dmy knockdown reduced the Dmy expression by 66–92%, even from 5 daf (p < 0.05). At 5 daf, there was slight reduction in the expression of other male-associated genes like Gsdf and Sox9a2. At 0 dah, the reduction rate of Sox9a2 expression was much larger than Gsdf. At 5 and 10 dah, both Gsdf and Sox9a2, resulted in approximately 80–90% reduction compared to controls (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3A). Similar trend was also observed in the adults. Until 10 dah, there was no Dmrt1 expression in both the knockdown and control groups. However, in the knockdown group, Dmrt1 expression was drastically reduced in adulthood (p < 0.05) (Supplementary Figs 3, 4). All these results were further substantiated using in situ hybridisation (ISH). Among the fully-grown Dmy-KD XY fish, only the partially sex reversed fish showed low expression (p < 0.05) of Dmy, Gsdf and the spermatogonial markers (Cyp11a and Cyp11b) (Fig. 2K,M,O & S3). On the other hand, the fully developed pmDMY-KD XY ovary did not show any sign of spermatogonial marker gene expression but had female-like expression of Gsdf and other male dominated genes (p < 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 3).Dmy-knockdown induced transcriptional alterations of male and female associated genes.(A,B) Ontogenic changes in the expression of male (Dmy, Gsdf, Sox9a2 and Dmrt1) (A) and female (Rspo1, Foxl2 and Spo11) (B) associated genes from 5 daf (5F) to 10 dah (10H) were analysed by real-time PCR. Data were normalised with Ef1a expression. Each column in the graph represents mean ± SEM of 10 individuals of control XY (white columns) and Dmy-knockdown XY (grey columns) fish. Letters above the bars indicate that these groups differ significantly (p < 0.05) from each other.To determine the effect of Dmy knockdown on the expression of female-associated genes, real-time PCR was carried out using Dmy-KD fish. Rspo1 showed increased expression at 5 daf in knockdown fish, which became more evident at later stages in comparison to control-XY groups (p < 0.05). However, Foxl2 could only be differentiated from 0 dah onwards. Interestingly, when compared to controls, all these female-specific genes were markedly upregulated from 5 dah (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3B). In adults, except for four fish, all showed a substantial increase in the expression of female-associated genes compared to their respective controls (Supplementary Fig. 3). Dmy-KD-induced feminization was further confirmed by ISH (Fig. 2J,L,N). All the sex-reversed Dmy-KD XY fish (both partial and complete) showed elevated Spo11, Foxl2, Rspo1 and Cyp19a1 (ovarian aromatase) expression (Supplementary Fig. 3), while unchanged fish had male-alike or no expression of these genes.In mammals, Wt1 is known to be an important regulator of Sry. Duplicated copies of Wt1 (Wt1a and Wt1b) have been reported in teleosts, including medaka31. In order to understand the isoform-specific effects of Wt1 on Dmy regulation, we characterised the expression patterns of Dmy, Wt1a and Wt1b during gonadal differentiation in both XY and XX fish, including the F3 Dmy KD transgenics (pmDMY-KD XY). Wt1a starts its zygotic expression from stage 12 (10 hours after fertilization, haf) (Fig. 4A), while Wt1b sets in from stage 25 (2 daf) (data not shown). Interestingly, Dmy initiated its zygotic expression from stage 18 (1 daf) (Fig. 4A), which was much later than Wt1a expression but earlier than Wt1b expression. This gave rise to a possibility of Wt1a as a candidate regulator of Dmy in medaka. Thereafter, we examined the effect of Dmy knockdown on Wt1a expression. Our real-time PCR and whole-mount ISH data showed identical expression between pmDMY-KD XY and control XY embryos at different stages (Fig. 4B–D).Wt1, an upstream candidate for Dmy regulation.(A) Dmy and Wt1a expression were analysed using several early stage samples (S4-S18) to assess the precise start point of zygotic expression (XX, white columns and XY, grey columns). (B) Differences in Wt1a expression between control (white columns) and Dmy-KD (grey columns) XY embryos during gonadal differentiation (S20-S39) were also analysed by real-time PCR. (C,D) Wt1a specific whole mount ISH of Dmy-KD XY (C) and control XY (D) embryos (stage 22) showed no virtual difference. (E) Luciferase assays using HEK293 cells showed a dose dependent activation of Dmy promoter by Wt1a KTS (−). Graphical data are presented as an average of three independent experiments, each containing triplicates of individual sampling group. Error bars represent SEM. Letters (a–c) above the bars indicate that these groups differ significantly from each other at p < 0.05.In the subsequent experiment, we found a highly conserved Wt1-binding site (GAGGGGGGAG) in the Dmy promoter region32. Reportedly, in mammals, Wt1 KTS (+) alternatively spliced isoform regulates the SRY transcription in a dose responsive manner32. To determine the role of Wt1(s) in the regulation of Dmy expression, a luciferase assay was performed using four Wt1-ORF plasmids (Wt1a KTS (+/−) and Wt1b KTS (+/−)) and Dmy promoter construct. To our surprise, only the Wt1a KTS (−) isoform showed dose-dependent activation of Dmy promoter-driven luciferase production (Fig. 4E).To find out the direct downstream target of Dmy, we performed chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) using Dmy (tagged with eGFP) mRNA overexpressed 6 daf medaka embryos. Since we observed differential but significant Dmy knockdown dependent down-regulation of Gsdf and Sox9a2 and up-regulation of Rspo1, the potential downstream targets for Dmy, these genes were chosen as candidates for ChIP analysis. The primers were selected based on the availability of Dmy binding site (wacawtgtwk)33 in both upstream (−20 kb) and downstream (+10 kb) region of candidate genes. We found strong Gsdf and Rspo1 (4–6 and 3.5–5 fold, respectively, depending on the area tested), but weak Sox9a2 (1.59–2.87 fold) enrichment from 6 daf Dmy-GFP mRNA-injected embryonic samples (details in Supplementary Materials and Methods), determined by ChIP, using GFP antibody (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Fig. 5). Recently we published that, Rspo1 promoter activity was inversely regulated by Dmy34. To get a better idea about Dmy association in Gsdf and Sox9a2 regulation, we performed in vitro promoter assay of both Gsdf and Sox9a2 promoters using OL32 cell line. Although the Ol32 cells possess slight Dmy, Gsdf and Sox9a2 transcription of its own, the luciferase activity of both promoters and transcription of Gsdf and Sox9a2 showed significant increment after Dmy overexpression, in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 5B). Owing to the transcriptional history of medaka and our data, it is highly likely that Dmy directly promotes the transcriptions of both Gsdf and Sox9a2 and simultaneously suppresses Rspo1 to maintain the masculinity. If these assumptions are correct, then Gsdf and Sox9a2 will alone or together be sufficient to rescue the Dmy knockdown effect. To prove that, Gsdf (tagged with mCherry) and Sox9a2 (tagged with cyan) mRNA were singularly injected or co-injected into both olvas-eGFP XX and olvas-eGFP Dmy-KD XY embryos (F3 generation). Although singular injections failed to completely suppress meiosis and proliferative mitosis, co-injection re-established the male phenotype in the XY gonad, leading to the complete formation of testis (Fig. 5C–F, Supplementary Fig. 6). However, the amount of Dmy remained substantially low (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, the Gsdf and Sox9a2 co-injected control olvas-eGFP XX embryos were also redirected towards male type gonadal development, i.e. restriction in germ cell proliferation (Fig. 5D,E).Gsdf and Sox9a2 are potential downstream targets of Dmy.(A) In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of candidate Dmy targets. Relative expression to control input was calculated using real-time PCR and plotted on the graph. Data are presented as means ± SEM of 4 separate experiments and significances (p < 0.05) are denoted by different letters. (B) Effects of Dmy overexpression on Gsdf and Sox9a2 promoter activity (upper panel) and mRNA transcription (lower panel) were ascertained. (C) Differences in Dmy expression between control (white columns) and olvas-eGFP-Dmy-KD co-injected with Gsdf-cherry and Sox9a2-cyan (grey columns) XY embryos during gonadal differentiation (S20-S39) were assessed using real-time PCR.

(E) The total number of germ cells was plotted (Y-axis) against different injected groups (X-axis). Data are presented as means of 10 individuals (error bars represent SEM). Different letters (a–d) indicate significant differences from other groups at p < 0.05. Note: C, G, S and G + S represents PBS, Gsdf-cherry, Sox9a2-cyan and Gsdf-cherry/Sox9a2-cyan mRNA injected embryos, respectively. (F) The gonadal sexuality of olvas-eGFP-Dmy-KD embryos co-overexpressed with Gsdf-Sox9a2 (N = 7) was assessed at maturity. (Scale bar, 20 μm).In the present study, we developed a unique, relatively stable, cost-effective and gene-specific RNAi delivery system, capable of producing multiple small RNA against a specific gene, Dmy, in medaka. A DNA vector-based approach was used, owing to its many advantages over other approaches, like better stability, prolonged retention, ease of transmission and cost effectiveness35,36. The long AS molecule produced by this vector was useful in inhibiting the gene expression by promoting degradation of double-stranded RNA, perhaps by Dicer and miRNA/siRNA mechanism37. Availability of several kinds of unique small RNA helped us to hypothesize that AS-RNA were processed by the cell machinery to generate several small RNA (60–70 nucleotides) and siRNA (18–28 nucleotides) molecules27,28 and increase the silencing efficiency. Moreover, due to continuous transcription, long AS-RNAs were expected to be constitutively transcribed in vivo, thus blocking the translation of messenger RNA before being degraded38. The hypothesis was further confirmed by specific knockdown of Gfp expression in olvas-eGFP transgenic medaka. The specificity of Gfp knockdown was undoubtedly confirmed by the microscopic reduction of Gfp expression in the gonads. However, unlike shrimp39, in the present study, we did not observe any suppression in growth and reproduction of knockdown fish.This newly developed knockdown technology was used to investigate the function of the zygotic gene product, Dmy, in medaka throughout its life span. Upon knockdown of Dmy, we were successful in generating a functional sex-reversed XY medaka with full fertilization potential. The marked suppression of Dmy, even at 5 daf, suggests the efficacy of knockdown. Being the master sex determination regulator in medaka, it is very important to know the detailed role of Dmy during gonadal determination, development and maturation. In medaka, early appearance of progressive mitosis and meiosis is the first sign of morphological sex determination in females. However, in males, the occurrence of Dmy arrests mitosis and drives the male sex determination. In the present study, we could also observe meiosis in Dmy-KD XY gonads even at 0 dah, confirming the previous findings which showed a surge in Scp3 production and mitotic proliferation in XY DMY-gripNA and morpholino knockdown medaka15,40.Knockdown of Dmy also induced marked reduction of two major male-associated autosomal genes, Gsdf and Sox9a2, during early gonadal sex differentiation in XY fish. We have previously shown that a rise in Gsdf expression is seen specifically in genetic males around 6 daf, almost the same time at which Dmy expression takes the peak16. Importantly, Dmy and Gsdf were found to be co-localized in the same somatic cells in the XY gonads16. Although there was very little reduction in Gsdf expression at 5 daf after knockdown of Dmy, a marked reduction was evident at 5 and 10 dah. Similarly, ChIP and promoter analysis also depicted direct regulation between Gsdf and Dmy. This suggests that male oriented gonadal fate determination was initiated by Dmy expression and further progressed by Dmy and Gsdf in a co-operative manner16. This also supports our previous hypothesis that Gsdf is a potential target of Dmy in male gonad development in XY Japanese medaka (O. latipes)16. Intriguingly, recent findings indicate that Gsdf is the master sex-determining gene in the Hainan medaka, Oryzias curvinotus, a closely related species of medaka7. Although Dmy is not present in O. luzonensis, the spatial and temporal expression pattern of Gsdf is closely correlated to Dmy in medaka16 and the expression patterns of more downstream genes in testicular differentiation, such as Sox9a2 and Dmrt1, are similar in both medaka species7,23,41. Therefore, O. latipes and O. luzonensis share a common sex differentiation pathway downstream of Gsdf and, if high Gsdf expression is achieved during sex differentiation, then the XX embryo develops as a male without Dmy7.In a number of higher vertebrates, Sox9 has been shown to play a major conserved role in testis determination. In mice, from 10.5 dpc, the Y-linked sex-determining gene Sry is expressed in XY genital ridges and initiates Sox9 expression and testis differentiation42. Knocking-down of Sry expression resulted in significant decrease in the Sox9 expression and gonadal feminization of mouse embryos43. Similarly, in chicken, Sox9 expression was significantly reduced in Dmrt1 knockdown genetically male (ZZ) gonads relative to controls4. In medaka, Sox9a2 (a duplicated homologue of mammalian Sox9) is initially expressed in somatic cells of both sexes, but upregulated in testicular somatic cells and down regulated in the XX gonads, at 10 to 30 dah17. Contrastingly, Nakamura et al.18, using both transgenic and chimeric Sox9a2 (Sox9b) medaka mutants, reported that Sox9a2 is required for germ cell proliferation and survival, but not for testis determination17. However, we previously depicted a significant elevation of Sox9a2 at 10 dah XY fish, suggesting its role in testis development17,18. In the present study, upon Dmy knockdown, there was a marked reduction of Sox9a2 expression even from 0 dah onward. These results suggest that Sox9a2 is downstream of Dmy and possesses some role in the early stages of testis differentiation. Although significantly lower, the precipitation of Sox9a2 DNA in Dmy-ChIP experiment suggests a direct link between Sox9a2 and Dmy, which is substantiated by our promoter analysis data. Further in-depth analysis is required to clarify the role of Dmy-Sox9a2 interaction in testis differentiation and development in medaka.As stated above, the expression of two major male-associated genes, Gsdf and Sox9a2, were markedly reduced in Dmy-KD XY fish. In the present study, the availability of F3 Dmy-KD transgenics gave us the option to study the downstream targets of Dmy by overexpressing candidate down-stream genes such as Gsdf and Sox9a2. Our results showed that although individual overexpression of either Gsdf or Sox9a2 induced partial recovery of male phenotype, co-overexpression of these two genes could fully re-establish the male pathway, producing fertile sperm in Dmy-KD fish. These results, along with the ChIP data, suggest some parallel and essential role of these two genes in testicular differentiation and development. Since Gsdf and Sox9a2 are expressed in the same somatic cells in medaka XY gonads, it is quite possible that, like mammalian Sry/Sox9-Fgf9 regulation11, Dmy could simultaneously induce both Gsdf and Sox9a2, which in turn influences each other to maintain masculinity. However, no such evidence has been reported till date in medaka.Unlike Gsdf and Sox9a2, in XY medaka gonad, Dmrt1 expression is initiated only after the formation of testis (20–30 dah). Recently, we found that Dmrt1 mutant XY medaka develops gonad that initially appear to be males but later becomes fertile XY females44. These results indicate that Dmrt1 is essential to maintain testicular identity after Dmy-triggered male differentiation pathway. In the present study, we found a drastic reduction of Dmrt1 expression in sex-reversed XY adults, further confirming the significance of Dmrt1 in maintaining testicular differentiation and development.In this study, Dmy knockdown caused complete suppression of male-associated genes in XY gonads and generated sex-reversed XY fertile females, which thereby highlights the essentiality of female/ovarian-associated genes in Dmy-reduced condition. Although the key ovarian determinant has not yet been identified, we now know that a number of female-associated factors, such as canonical Wnt signaling through Wnt4, Rspo1 and β-catenin and Foxl2, are critical for ovarian differentiation in vertebrates45,46. Recently, much attention has been paid to the role of Rspo-activated signaling pathway in early sex determination and differentiation. Rspo1 displays a conserved, female-specific increase in expression in several vertebrate species33,47. In medaka, Rspo1 is predominantly expressed in XX gonads during sex differentiation, immediately preceding the first signs of ovarian differentiation, suggesting that Rspo1 is a key player in medaka ovarian differentiation20. In the present study, we observed significant elevation in Rspo1 expression at 0 dah in Dmy-KD XY fish. It is important to note that at this stage Dmy expression is already markedly down regulated, but Gsdf expression is still elevated. These findings suggest that Dmy expression, but not Gsdf expression, in males can block the Rspo1 signalling. It has been proposed that the fate of the developing mammalian gonad involves a tug of war between the Sry/Sox9-induced Fgf9 signalling (male promoting) versus the Wnt signalling (female promoting)46. In this connection, it is important to note that, Rspo1 directly interacts with Dmy (as evidenced by ChIP) and Rspo1 expression is localized to somatic cells surrounding germ cells as well as germ cells during early developmental stages20. Further studies are required to determine whether a similar antagonistic system (the Dmy/Gsdf signalling in males versus the Rspo1 signalling in females) also applies in medaka.Foxl2 is also known to be involved in ovarian differentiation in a number of vertebrate species45. More recently, FOXL2 was identified as a bona fide female sex-determining gene in goat48. In medaka, Foxl2 is expressed only in the female gonads during gonadal differentiation, which starts around the day of hatching. In Dmy-KD XY fish, Foxl2 expression was markedly upregulated at 5 dah, a time that coincides well with the marked fall in Gsdf expression in the Dmy-KD fish. These findings may suggest that there is a counter interaction between Gsdf and Foxl2, but this remains to be elucidated.The important role of the Rspo1 and Foxl2 appears to be conserved from fish to mammals. In medaka, Rspo1 expression precedes Foxl2 by 2–3 days. It is important to determine how these two genes interact to coordinate ovarian determination and differentiation. We recently showed that in medaka, the expression profiles of Rspo1–3 in gonads were markedly upregulated during a short period of oestrogenic exposure in 0 dah XY fish20 and the expression of ERβ2, but neither ERα nor ERβ1, exhibited marked increase in XX embryos between 6 and 8 daf with a peak at 7 daf21. It was also shown that Foxl2 upregulated Cyp19a1 gene transcription in a female-specific manner in other fish22. Thus, it is possible that oestrogen may be an intervening factor between Rspo1 and Foxl2 during early ovarian differentiation in medaka.Although knockdown of Dmy gave rise to functional XY sex reversal, the exact molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of Dmy expression in fish sex determination, is still vaguely understood. In mammals, a number of genes have been implicated as potential regulators of Sry expression, such as Gata2, Gata4, M33 and Wt142. The present study focuses on the role of one of these genes, Wt1, in the regulation of Dmy during early testicular differentiation. In medaka, Wt1a is one of the primary genes expressed in somatic cells (precursor cells for Dmy expression) of bipotential gonads and first appears at Stage 12, preceding the zygotic expression of Dmy31. This highlights the importance of Wt1a in the regulation of Dmy. Unlike male and female-associated genes, Wt1a expression showed no change between control and Dmy-KD XY fish, suggesting that Wt1a is upstream of Dmy. Confirming this hypothesis, our results showed that Wt1a enhances the promoter activity of Dmy in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, in mammals, the Wt1a KTS (−) and KTS (+) isoforms acts on transcription and RNA stability of Sry, respectively49,50. Taken together, these data suggests a conserved role of Wt1a in regulating the two sex-determining genes, Sry and Dmy. It is of interest to determine whether Wt1 can also regulate the expression of chicken Dmrt14, Xenopus laevis Dm-W5 and other novel fish specific sex determining genes, i.e. Gsdf, Amh, Amhr2, SdY and Sox36,7,8,9.In conclusion, the new gene-specific transgenic RNAi technology developed for medaka has made it possible for the first time to investigate the function of Dmy in XY fish throughout its life span. A distinct shift in gene expression patterns from Gsdf/Sox9a2 to Rspo1/Foxl2 occurs in the germ cells surrounding somatic cells of Dmy-KD XY embryos, leading to a functional male to female sex reversal. Further studies, using this Dmy knockdown line, along with other related transgenics/mutants, are required to understand the 1) exact roles of Gsdf and Sox9a2 in testicular differentiation and development and 2) life long tug of war between male/female associated genes in determining or maintaining the gonadal sex. The probable limitations of this method concerning the sterility of homozygous and heterozygous animals and associated hurdles of transgenic line maintenance need to be critically investigated, using fertility-associated genes.The studies were carried out in accordance with the Institutional Ethics Committee of National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan, strictly adhering to the guidelines set for the usage of animals by this committee.

 5, Article number: 14057 (2015) Cite this article659 Accesses11 Citations1 AltmetricMetricsMedaka is an ideal model for sex determination and sex reversal, such as XY phenotypically female patients in humans. Here, we assembled improved TALENs targeting the DMY gene and generated XYDMY− mutants to investigate gonadal dysgenesis in medaka. DMY-TALENs resulted in indel mutations at the targeted loci (46.8%). DMY-nanos3UTR-TALENs induced mutations were passed through the germline to F1 generation with efficiencies of up to 91.7%. XYDMY− mutants developed into females, laid eggs and stably passed the YDMY− chromosome to next generation. RNA-seq generated 157 million raw reads from WT male (WT_M_TE), WT female (WT_F_OV) and XYDMY− female medaka (TA_F_OV) gonad libraries. Differential expression analysis identified 144 up- and 293 down-regulated genes in TA_F_OV compared with WT_F_OV, 387 up- and 338 down-regulated genes in TA_F_OV compared with WT_M_TE. According to genes annotation and functional prediction, such as Wnt1 and PRCK, it revealed that incomplete ovarian function and reduced fertility of XYDMY− mutant is closely related to the wnt signaling pathway. Our results provided the transcriptional profiles of XYDMY− mutants, revealed the mechanism between sex reversal and DMY in medaka and suggested that XYDMY− medaka was a novel mutant that is useful for investigating gonadal dysgenesis in phenotypic female patients with the 46, XY karyotype.Over two decades have passed since the male determining gene, Sry, was identified1. The SRY gene plays a pivotal role in sex determination: point mutations or deletions of the SRY gene are found in approximately 15% of XY females in humans2,3. XY female syndrome, phenotypic female patients with the XY karyotype, has been studied clinically, cytogenetically, hormonally, endoscopically and histologically4,5,6. However, the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms of SRY-induced XY female syndrome remain largely unknown. A lack of animal models has meant that it is difficult to perform in-depth studies of the pathological changes and to determine the mechanisms underlying the XY female syndrome.Sex-determining systems in fish are very diverse, which could be determined by heredity, environment, or both. Meanwhile, the pathway of sex determination can be manipulated by administering exogenous sex steroids7,8,9,10,11. In non-mammalian species, which also have a XX-XY sex-determination system, SRY is not present at all. Until DMY gene of medaka (Oryzias latipes) was identified in the teleost fish12,13, it is believed that the XX-XY sex-determination system was conserved in a wide range of animals, including C. elegans, Drosophila, fish and mammals. Although much is known about the master male sex-determining (SD) gene in medaka12,14,15,16, the precise mechanisms involved in primary sex determination and sex differentiation remain undefined. It is difficult to perform specific gene targeting in medaka, because of the lack of methodologies for homologous recombination and embryonic stem cell derivation, which has impeded its use in male heterogametic (XX-XY) sex determination system studies.Modifications of genomes have laid the foundation of functional studies in modern biology and have led to significant discoveries17. Recently, Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs)18,19,20, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs)21,22,23,24 and clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)25,26,27 have been shown to edit genomic DNA in a variety of cell types and different model organisms at stable efficiency and specificity. In our previous studies, we modified the Golden Gate method to disrupt the gene and edit the genome in zebrafish28,29 and medaka30. Here, we directly produced TALEN-induced XYDMY− females in medaka using TALENs. Phenotype of XYDMY− mutant is very similar to human XY female syndrome4,5,6 and SRY KO mouse3,31, especially as several individuals in the population were fertile.The specificity of targeted sites and the off-target phenomenon are core problems in gene knockout and gene editing research. To test for potential nonspecific mutations induced by TALENs, we also developed a simple and reliable off-target prediction program for confirming TALEN-induced mutation. The TALEN-induced XYDMY− medaka developed into females and laid eggs. Although the sex-determining function of the DMY protein is already recognized; however, as a transcription factor, how does it regulate the downstream factor(s) to control testis differentiation, development and germ cell maturation? To better explain DMY’s regulatory functions as a transcription factor, we performed RNA-seq, a recently developed approach to transcriptome profiling based on deep-sequencing32 and generated 157 million raw reads from WT male (WT_M_TE), WT female (WT_F_OV) and XYDMY− female medaka (TA_F_OV) gonad libraries. These transcriptomic data will contribute to unravel the relationship and mechanism between sex reversal and the DMY gene. Our results suggest that the medaka XYDMY− mutant is a novel mutant line that is useful for investigating XY to XX sex reversal and gonadal dysgenesis in phenotypically female patient with the 46, XY karyotype.To improve the germline integration efficiency, we incorporated the zebrafish nanos-3′UTR into the TALEN construct (Fig. 1A). Potential TALEN target sites were scanned and designed in the exon of the DMY/DMRT1bY gene (ENSORLT000000025382 and ENSORLT000000025383) (Fig. 1B). We generated TALEN constructs using our previously published method29. The mixture containing a pair of TALEN mRNAs was microinjected into one-cell stage embryos of medaka (Fig. 2A and File S1). 72 hours after microinjection, ten injected embryos were randomly pooled for extracting genomic DNA. As illustrated in Fig. 2B, primers DMY F and DMY R bridge both the effector binding element (EBE) regions, while primers DMY F1 and DMY R link the spacer region and the downstream EBE. If primer DMY F and DMY R generated a 396 bp fragment, while primer DMY F1 and DMY R failed to generate the 167 bp fragment, the result suggested that the targeted gene was disrupted by the TALENs (Fig. 2C). Sequenced PCR positive clones had mutated sequences in the spacer (Fig. 2D). Both DMY-TALENs and DMY-Nanos-3UTR TALENs were effective at disrupting the targeted genes in medaka embryos. Various concentrations (200, 400, 600 and 800 pg) of the TALENs mRNA were microinjected (Fig. 2E,F, File S1 and S2). The targeting efficiency of the DMY-TALENs was good, with a higher TALEN-induced mutation ratio of 42.07% and lower levels of dead and deformed embryos when 600 pg mRNA was microinjected (Fig. 2G,I). Similarly, the targeting efficiency of DMY-nanos-3UTR TALENs was about 41.96% (Fig. 2H,I). Thus, 600 pg was determined as the appropriate concentration in medaka. These results indicated that the TALEN activity was dose-dependent and high-dose microinjection of TALEN mRNA might cause nonspecific and toxic defects in medaka embryos (Fig. 2E–I, File S1 and S2).The design and assembly of DMY-TALEN sites.(A) Reconstructions of pCS2- DMY-TALENs -ELD/KKR-nanos UTR plasmids.

(B) Detection of mutations in TALEN targeted medaka embryos. Primers DMY F, DMY F1 and DMY R were used to amply the DMY gene. Primers DMY F and DMY R bridge both EBE regions, while primers DMY F1 and DMY R link the spacer region and the downstream EBE. DMY F and DMY R generated a 396 bp PCR fragment. DMY F1 and DMY R generated a 167 bp PCR fragment. If primer DMY F and DMY R generated a PCR fragment, while primer DMY F1 and DMY R failed to do so, this suggested that the targeted gene is disrupted by the DMY-TALEN.

(H) The targeting efficiency statistics of DMY-nanos-3UTR TALENs. (I) Comparative analysis of mutation rate and germline transmission rate between DMY-TALENs and DMY-nanos3UTR-TALENs.Successful germline transmission is essential to establish knockout lines. To evaluate the germline transmission efficiency of the TALEN-mediated gene disruption, ten embryos for DMY and DMY-nanos3UTR from each independent cross were individually collected at 3 days post fertilization (dpf) and genomic DNA was extracted from each cross to assess mutagenesis at the TALEN-targeted site (Fig. 2C,D). 9.02% of DMY-TALEN-induced F1 embryos carried mutations; and 37.56% of DMY-nanos3UTR-TALEN-induced F1 embryos carried mutations in the DMY gene (Fig. 2I and File S2). The higher proportion induced by DMY-nanos3UTR-TALEN indicated that a majority of gametes in the F0 medaka were mutant. These results indicated that there was no significant difference in the targeting efficiency of F0 somatic mutations at the targeted loci (Fig. 2H,I); however, DMY-nanos3UTR-TALEN induced a higher portion of mutations in the germline than DMY-TALENs did.To test for potential nonspecific mutations induced by TALENs, we designed a program to scan the medaka genomic sequence (http://www.ensembl.org/Oryzias_latipes) to identify potential off-target sites potentially targeted by DMY TALENs. Potential off-target sites of DMY-TALENs were searched using the program and 55 candidate sites were identified (File S3). When the spacers were less than 10 bp or more than 24 bp long, the scaffold of TALENs had lower disrupting activity33,34. Five of the 55 candidates had spacers less than 10 bp and 43 of 55 candidates had spacers of more than 24 bp, indicating that it is unlikely that the TALENs could induce mutations at these sites. We analyzed one candidate site (Chr.3: 36,197,357–36,197,403) that had 7-bp mismatches in the recognition sequences and a 12-bp spacer (File S4). PCR amplified the identified potential off-target regions using genomic DNA from TALEN-injected embryos as template; no mutations were found at these sites by DNA sequencing. This result suggested that the novel program could predict the potential off-target sites of TALENs; and that TALENs have high specificity for their target sequences.The mating scheme for the TALENs-induced DMY-mutant lines is shown in Fig. 3A. The F0 generation was produced by microinjecting 600 pg DMY-nanos3UTR-TALENs into one-cell stage embryos of medaka; the mutation rate was 46.8% (15/32) (Fig. 3B). The DMY gene knockout medaka could develop into females. 11-bp deletions (named DMYΔ11) and 16-bp insertions (named DMY+16) were identified and chosen to establish mutant lines (Fig. 3C,D). Notably, during the establishment of the mutant lines, two genotyping alleles of DMY gene fragments were identified in individual TALEN-induced F1 mutations using the Li-con 4300 system (Fig. 4A). This result indicated that YDMY−Y male mutants were present in the testcross F1 generation. The genetic males (XY) of the DMY gene mutants, DMYΔ11 and DMY+16 mutant types, developed into females in the F2 generation, which was identified using genomic PCR of the DMY gene (Fig. 4B). To confirm un-expression and dysfunction of DMY gene in the XYDMY− F2 generation, using RT-PCR, expression of DMY gene was not identified in the XYDMY− female medaka (both DMYΔ11 and DMY+16) (Fig. 4C). The first morphological sex difference manifested in the gonads is reflected in the number of germ cells14,35. The number of germ cells in several DMY mutants identified from wild populations resembled that of the female13,16,36. To elucidate sex reversal during the development of XYDMY− mutants, we evaluated the effect of DMY on germ cell number at 5 days after hatching (DAH) in the XYDMY− F3 generation. The XYDMY− mutant fry had more germ cells than that of the WT XY male at 5 DAH (Fig. 4D). This implied sex reversal of XYDMY− mutants took place in early developmental stages and the increased number of germ cells in the XYDMY− mutants may be due to the disruption of DMY gene expression.Flowchart and establishment of DMY-TALENs-induced mutant lines.(A) Flowchart of DMY-TALENs-induced mutant lines.

Open circles represent the number of germ cells in individuals (N = 9). **P < 0.001. (E) The CDS frameshift mutations of TALEN-induced DMY gene. WT: CDS sequence of DMY.According to the amino acid sequence of DMY, DMYΔ11 and DMY+16 are frame-shifted mutant alleles that would produce truncated DMY protein caused by a region of altered translation (Fig. 4E). Thus, an error of the coding sequence has occurred in the mutated DMY gene that resulted in the loss function of the DMY gene. The XYDMY− female or YDMY−Y male (N = 10) from F2 generation that had lost the DMY gene were crossed with the WT to obtain the testcross F3 generation. XX female, XY male, XYDMY− mutant female and YDMY−Y mutant male were identified in the XY female testcross F3 generation. XY males and XYDMY− mutant females were identified in the YDMY−Y male testcross F3 generation. This showed that the DMY gene in the Y chromosome of WT medaka rescued the female phenotype of DMY gene disruption in mutated XY female medaka. Unfortunately, an YDMY−YDMY− mutant female with a genomic homozygous DMY gene mutation on the Y chromosome was never found.Mature XYDMY− mutants in the F3 generation were obtained for phenotype identification, histological analyses and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (Fig. 5). There are significant differences between females and males in the size and shape of dorsal and anal fins13,14, which are main part of the secondary morphological sexual characteristics in medaka. The shape of both dorsal and anal fins of XYDMY− sex reversal female were similar to that of the WT XX female, rather than to that of the WT XY male. The size of both dorsal and anal fins of XYDMY− female was significant smaller than those of the WT XY males (Fig. 5A). In addition, ovarian tissue was identified in XYDMY− mutants (Fig. 5B). To confirm the Y chromosome in the TALENs-induced mutants, we analyzed the karyotypes of metaphase cells from the WT male, WT female and XYDMY− female using FISH showing the male specific hybridization signal12. Compared with the two spots in females, three hybridization spots for the specific probe were identified in males (Fig. 5C). The additional FISH signal in males is on the Y chromosome. XYDMY− mutants did not express DMY gene, which were different from WT XY individuals (Fig. 4C). The gonadosomatic index (GSI) and the maturation stages of oocytes are commonly used to evaluate the gonad and gonad development37. At 90 days after hatching, the GSI of XYDMY− mutated female was 10.9 (N = 10); that of the WT female and WT male were 19.1 and 0.7, respectively (Fig. 5D). During the generation of offspring from the XYDMY− mutated female testcross, we found that it was difficult to obtain a sufficient number of offspring. Therefore, we performed the comparative analysis of the number of matured oocytes between the WT female and XYDMY− mutants (N = 10). During 10 days’ embryos collecting, the XYDMY− mutated female produced six eggs per day on average; whereas, the WT XX female produced 20 eggs per day (Fig. 5E). The results from F2 phenotypes revealed that the genetic males (XY) of TALENs-induced DMY gene disruption mutants all developed into females and laid eggs (DMYΔ11 and DMY+16 mutants). Furthermore, histological analyses demonstrated that all XY mutants developed into females; however, there were significant differences in germ cells and gonad (Fig. 5F). The ovary of XYDMY− mutants (12/15) appeared to have fewer oocytes than that of the WT XX female (Fig. 5F). According to the developmental stage of oocytes in medaka, there were equilibrium distributions in each stage of oocytes in the WT XX female ovary, containing cortical alveolar oocytes (CA), vitellogenic oocytes (VO) and mature oocytes (MO). Among 15 XYDMY− mutants (15 mutants were identified in the same genotype, fed in the same tank and sampled at the same time), three did not form mature oocytes, with majority of chromatin nucleolar oocytes (CN), several perinucleolar oocytes (PO) and few CA oocytes in the ovary and no further developmental stage oocytes (Fig. 5F). Twelve of them successfully formed MOs, however, the size of ovary and total number of each developmental stage oocytes were significant smaller and fewer than that of WT XX female (Fig. 5F). This can also explain it is difficult to collect embryos in XYDMY− mutants, even there is sometimes no embryos could be collection (Fig. 5E). The analysis of gonadal histology, GSI and the statistics of mature eggs demonstrated significant differences in the gonadal development and maturity between WT females and XYDMY− mutant females.Phenotypic identification and analysis of XYDMY− mutants.(A) Phenotypic diagnostics of the secondary sexual characters in XYDMY− mutants.

For both the WT and DMY-mutants, ten samples of gonadal tissues were mixed for library construction. RNA-seq generated 157 million raw reads comprising 10333, 8746 and 8621 transcripts, respectively (Fig. 6A). Using the Ensembl medaka genome database as the reference, 75.8% of the raw reads matched medaka genomic sequences (File S6). Twelve genes were selected randomly from hundreds of different expression transcripts between the gonad of WT and that of DMY mutants. The result of real-time quantitative PCR showed that the trends of these genes expression were the same as in the RNA-seq data (File S7). Thus, the RNA-seq information was accurate and reliable.Bioinformatic analyses of RNA-seq data.(A) The number of novel transcripts in the RNA-seq data the WT female (WT_F_OV), the wild-type male (WT_M_Te) and XYDMY− female medaka (TA_F_OV).

(G) SRY binding sites. (H) The SRY binding sites analyses of differentially expressed genes among TA_F_Ov, WT_F_Ov and WT_M_Te.To isolate DMY-related gonad developmental-regulated genes, we conducted a comparative analysis of the three transcriptomic groups. Comparing WT_M_TE with TA_F_OV, there were 9407 differentially expressed transcripts (Data A, Dataset 1). The only difference between WT and TA medaka is the absence of the DMY gene, more or less, these differentially expressed genes were attributed to the loss of the DMY gene. There were 4629 upregulated genes and 4778 downregulated genes in WT-M-Te (Fig. 6B,C). The functions of these genes were mainly related to cilium morphogenesis (191), cilium organization (152), cilium assembly (152), spermatid differentiation and development, wnt signal pathway (77) (Dataset 1). The master male SD marker, DMY12,13 (Dmrt1Y, Uingene20290/Unigene19692), did not expressed in TA_F_OV (Dataset 1), supporting previous observations that DMY gene was successfully disrupted in XYDMY− mutants (Fig. 4C). The male sex-differentiation or testes maintaining marker Dmrt1a38 (Unigene42535/Unigene30831), Gsdf39 (Unigene44032), Sox9b40 (Unigene18419) were also significantly down-expressed in TA_F_OV (Dataset 1). Interestingly, the majority of genes in wnt signal pathway were differentially expressed between WT_M_TE and TA_F_OV. Wnt1 (Unigene54610), Wnt5a (Unigene50823), Wnt5b (Unigene25302), Wnt9 (Unigene32218), Wnt11 (CL6243), PRCK (CL13707, PREDICTED: Oryzias latipes PRKC apoptosis WT1 regulator protein-like), DKK (Unigene58048) and PRKCA (Unigene17297) were up-expressed in TA_F_OV; Wnt2 (Unigene 27916), Wnt8a (Unigene51222), FZD6 (CL9539) and FZD8 (Unigene49832) were down-expressed in TA_F_OV (Dataset 1). These genes also contribute significantly to the molecular supporting the sex-reversal female phenotype of XYDMY− mutants (Fig. 5A,B).Theoretically, a number of differentially expressed genes between the testis (WT_M_TE) and ovary (WT_F_OV) (Data B) might confound Data A. More accurately, Data B must be excluded from Data A. The intersection of Data A and Data B identified the real differentially expressed genes between the WT XY male testis and XYDMY− female ovary (Data C, Dataset 2), which were the sum of 309 transcripts, 276 transcripts, 144 transcripts, 293 transcripts, 62 transcripts and 78 transcripts, which are DMY -related or affected genes (Fig. 6F). Relative to WT_F_OV, 144 ovary-specific transcripts were downregulated and 293 ovary-specific transcripts were upregulated in male-to-female reversed gonads (Fig. 6F). 62 transcripts in XYDMY− female ovary were downregulated relative to WT_M_TE and were upregulated relative to WT_F_OV. 78 transcripts in XYDMY− female ovary were upregulated relative to WT_M_TE and were downregulated relative to WT_F_OV. Relative to WT_F_OV and WT_M_TE, 309 transcripts were upregulated in TA_F_OV and 276 transcripts were downregulated in TA_F_OV (Fig. 6F and Dataset 2). Seventy-three testis-specific transcripts were identified (Fig. 6E and File S8). GO analysis and homologous annotation with human genes is a traditional way to further predict the functions of the genes in Data C (Dataset 2). According to the annotation of Blast2GO, genes of Data C were associated with the regulation of ubiquitination and fertilization. Moreover, a large number of genes, such as ENSORLT00000000529, have not been previously reported.GO analysis is not a straightforward way to predict the relationships among genes. Sry and DMY are transcription factors; theoretically, their downstream genes should have the direct binding regions for Sry or DMY. The predicted binding site of human SRY is shown in Fig. 6G. Human homologous genes of data C were scanned for SRY binding sites (Dataset 3). If SRY binding sites could be found in the human homologous genes, we could speculate that their medaka homologous genes may have the DMY binding sites or be a directly affected gene. There were 9844 unique genes in medaka that were analyzed: 7440 of which had homologous genes in the human genome. There were 4644 human homologous transcripts that may have more than one potential SRY binding site (Fig. 6H and Dataset 3). A number of potential DMY regulated genes, such as SLC25A38, had a potential SRY binding site in the upstream region of its human homolog; and a novel transcript, ENSORLT00000000529, had six potential SRY binding sites in the upstream region of its human homolog. These genes are significant for investigating the transcriptional function of the DMY gene.When we compared TA_F_OV with WT_F_OV, 1163 differentially expressed transcripts (Data D) were found in XYDMY− female (Dataset 4). There were 515 upregulated genes and 647 downregulated genes in WT-F-Ov (Fig. 6B,D). Using Blast2GO, the differentially expressed genes were blasted and annotated on biological process (BP), cell components (CC) and molecular function (MF). The genes of Data D are associated with the wnt receptor signaling pathway (Predicted: syntabbulin-like, axin-2-like), ovarian follicle development (Forkhead box O5, Predicted: beta-arrestin-1-like, adenomatous polyposis coli protein-like, ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A-like, bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-1B-like) and the follicle-stimulating hormone signaling pathway (luteinizing hormone receptor, lhr, Predicted: beta-arrestin-1-like) (Dataset 4). In terms of the number and repetitions of the genes, the genes of the wnt signaling pathway were the most significant proportion of Data D. PRCKA (CL423) and DKK (Unigene31972) were up-expressed in TA_F_OV; Wnt1 (CL10671), MAPK8 (CL4166), FZD6 (CL9539) and PRCK (CL13707) were down-expressed in TA_F_OV. These genes, especially Wnt1 and PRCK (CL13707), were down-expressed in XYDMY− mutants, compared with WT XX females (Dataset 4). Therefore, we reasonably believed that the wnt signaling pathway is one of the vital pathways on regulating the development and mature of oocytes in XYDMY− mutants, why the ovarian function of XYDMY− mutants are significant lower than that of WT females. Comprehensive Data A, B, C and D, greatly promote research into the transcriptional function of the DMY gene in medaka, not only in sex reversal, but also in the normal development and maturation of gonads.Germline transmission of the knockout genotypes is critical to obtain homozygous gene knockout animals. Generally, a 46.8% mutation rate in the F0 is not ideal for gene disruption. Perhaps this low efficiency should be attributed to the DMY gene on the Y chromosome rather than our optimized TALENs. In general, there should be equal numbers of male and female embryos in a generation. This means that the targeting efficiency of DMY-TALENs could not beyond be greater than 50%. Indeed, in our results, the efficiency was never more than 50%, even if the concentration of TALENs was increased to 800pg (Fig. 2I). To improve the germline integration efficiency, we incorporated the zebrafish nanos-3′UTR into the TALEN construct (Fig. 1A), which was reported to protect mRNA from degradation in primordial germ cells and improve the germ cell targeting efficiency28,41,42. Compared with 9.02% DMY-TALEN-induced F1 embryos carrying mutations; there were 37.56% DMY-nanos3UTR-TALEN-induced F1 embryos that carried mutations in the DMY gene (Fig. 2I and File S2). These results indicated that DMY-nanos3UTR-TALEN induced a high proportion, possible a majority, of mutant gametes in the F0 medaka. Thus, the incorporation of the nanos-3′UTR into the TALEN construct improved the germ cell targeting efficiency in medaka, permitting the generation of medaka knockout lines.Specificity is essential to establish precisely targeted gene knockout lines. TALENs have become an accepted tool for targeted mutagenesis, but undesired off-targets, in addition to the targeted genomic region, remain an important issue15,21,43,44,45,46,47. Unfortunately, using e-PCR to perform BLAST searches, potential off-target sites were identified in several studies46. Using Primer3 and BLAST, potential off-target sites of the DMY gene in medaka were identified (File S5). According to this data, BLAST emphasized sequence similarity, but there were few base pair sites of TALENs that could match to potential off-target sites of the genomes. In fact, not only the similarity of sequence, but also that fact that the 0 position of EBEs must be T is very important to TALENs binding site48. Using the novel program, 55 candidates’ off-target sites were identified in the medaka genome. We amplified the top predicted potential off-target locus by PCR, sequenced it and found no mutations (File S4). Using our data, our program was more efficient than ePCR to predict TALENs off-target sites. Recently, tools for predicting TALEN off-targets have been developed, such as idTALE (http://idtale.kaust.edu.sa), Paired Target Finder (https://tale-nt.cac.cornell.edu) and TALENoffer49. Compared with these, the advantage of our program is its simplicity and reliability. However, a more detailed investigation on the possible off-target effects of TALENs and more accurate program will be needed in the future.Gonadal dysgenesis in 46, XY patients was first noted by Drash et al.4. Phenotypic female patient with an XY karyotype were initially reported by Kaplan5. Several phenotypic female patients with the XY karyotype were evaluated clinically, cytogenetically, hormonally, endoscopically and histologically6. The functional study of gonadal dysgenesis in phenotypic female patients with an XY karyotype has been hindered by a lack of animal models with specific mutations, except for the mouse sry mutant3,31. Using TALENs, two different Y-linked genes were efficiently manipulated in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs)31 and an Sry knockout mouse was generated3. The mutant mice are almost completely infertile, although the Sry knockout mouse is similar to humans in terms of their physiological phenotype. The phenotype of the DMY knockout medaka is also similar to that human XY female syndrome. In particular, a majority of fertile individuals were found in the population. XYDMY− female medakas could help in studies of the mechanism of human XY female syndrome in genetics and reproductive biology. Benefiting from the number of embryos or offspring from the parents, fish are good for large sample analysis and for investigating individual differences of human XY female syndrome in populations.DMY, a duplicated copy of DMRT1, is identified as the master male SD gene and shows all features of a SD gene in medaka12. In this study, we generated both insertions (+16) and deletions (−11) of the TALEN-induced DMY mutant line, which developed into females with the XY karyotype (Fig. 5A–C,F). Sex reversal was also reported very early in medaka50, which could be induced by steroid hormones or high temperature51,52. To evaluate whether the sex reversal observed in XYDMY− female medaka was caused by DMY gene mutation, the best method is rescue of the phenotypes of the XYDMY− female medaka. In the former case, the expected mutant DMY lacks functionally important motifs of DMY; this mutated Y chromosome could pair with the WT X and Y chromosome to generate females and males, respectively. Crossing with the WT medaka (Fig. 3), produced YDMY−Y male mutants in the next generation, which meant that dysfunction of the DMY gene was the unique difference between XYDMY− female and YDMY−Y male. This result confirmed that the sex reversal observed in XYDMY− female medakas was caused by a DMY gene mutation.Adults of two phenotypically female mutant lines were evaluated through mutation confirmation, phenotype diagnostic (Fig. 5A) and histological analysis (Fig. 5B,F). Using genomic PCR (Fig. 4B) and FISH of DMY gene (Fig. 5C) showing the specific hybridization signal of the Y chromosome, the two phenotypically female mutant lines were identified as genetic males with the XY karyotype. RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 4C) and RNA-seq (Dataset 1) confirmed that XYDMY− mutants did not express DMY gene, which were different from WT XY individuals. Gsdf, co-localized with DMY in the same somatic cells in the XY gonads, was expressed exclusively in primordial gonads of only the genetic males39. Both the increased number of germ cells (Fig. 4D) and the significantly down-expression of Gsdf gene (Unigene44032) implied sex reversal of XYDMY− mutants took place in early developmental stages, attributed to the disruption of DMY gene. As expected, the TALEN-induced DMY knockout medakas had female external and internal specificities. Unlike the Sry KO mouse, which did not produce any offspring3, the majority of TALEN-induced DMY knockout medakas were fertile. Twelve of 15 XYDMY− mutants developed functional ovaries; and the ovaries of three females showed incomplete development. There were significant differences among XYDMY− mutants, WT female and WT male in GSI (Fig. 5D) in terms of their GSI scores. Histological analysis showed that the ovary of XYDMY− mutants displayed a reduced number of oocytes (Fig. 5F). In three of the 15 mutants, no eggs could develop beyond CA oocytes. The other 12 could generate mature eggs, however, the mature oocytes number of XYDMY− mutants are significantly fewer than that of WT XX females. Therefore, the ovary function of XYDMY− mutants was lower than that of WT females, not only in quality, but also in the quantity (Fig. 5F). To investigate whether there is significant difference in the fertilization of eggs and between XYDMY− female and WT female; test crosses were continuously and systemically recorded. During generation of offspring from the XYDMY− female testcrosses, we found that it was always difficult to obtain a sufficient number of offspring. After 10 days of continuous monitoring, 6 eggs matured per day from XYDMY− mutants; 20 eggs matured per day from WT XX females (Fig. 5E). The results from F2 phenotypes revealed that a reduced number of mature oocytes were one of the most plausible explanations for the reduced fertility in the DMY KO medakas. Thus, the XYDMY− mutants could develop functional ovaries; however, the development, maturation and fertilization capacity of their eggs were significantly lower than those of the WT female.Natural sex reversal has been reported in medaka50 and mutation of the DMY gene was identified in several artificial mutants14. However, the molecular mechanism of sex reversal, inducing by loss of DMY, has not been resolved. RNA-Seq is a recently developed approach for transcriptome profiling that is based on deep-sequencing32. RNA-seq could quantify the changing expression levels of each transcript during development and under different conditions. XYDMY− mutant female from the F3 generation were used for RNA-seq analysis, which minimized the off-target effects of DMY-TALENs. Using the RNA-seq approach, we obtained transcriptome information of XYDMY− mutants and through a comparative analysis of them, revealed the transcriptional function of the DMY gene in medaka.Using RNA-seq, 157 million raw reads were generated from WT_M_TE, WT_F_OV and TA_F_OV libraries. However, only 75.8% of the processed reads were mapped to the reference genome of medaka in the Ensemble database (File S6). This indicated that the medaka genome information requires improvement and transcriptomic sequencing could revise and promote the improvement of medaka genome. In addition, it implied that it would be better to use independent analysis with no reference genome in the analysis of medaka transcriptome, which we used in this study. The problem with the medaka genomic information had little bearing on the fact that medaka is a good model for human diseases. Although only 7481 of 9844 transcripts could match the medaka genome, 7440 transcripts had homologous genes in the human genome (Fig. 6H). This suggested that medaka might be similar to humans in terms of sex determination and regulation; the medaka transcriptome data could play a role in the analysis of human sex reversal patients.Medaka sex is primarily determined by the presence or absence of DMY gene12,13. Several studies show that Dmrt116,38, Gsdf39 and Sox9b40 is essential to maintain testis differentiation or regulate testis development. Un-expression of DMY (Uingene20290) and lower expression of Dmrt1a (Unigene42535), Gsdf (Unigene44032) and Sox9b (Unigene18419) in RNA-seq analysis provided the molecular basis to the failure of male sex determination, male-to-female sex reversal and the failure of testis differentiation or development in XYDMY− mutants (Dataset 1). Among the differentially expressed genes in TA_F_OV compared with WT_F_OV and TA_F_OV compared with WT_M_TE (Fig. 6F and Dataset 2), we found several potential factors may directly bind SRY and DMY, such as SLC25A38 and ENSORLT00000000529. This validated the transcriptional function of the DMY gene. Theoretically, the DMY gene, a SD gene, might have a relationship with the sperm production and cilia assembly. However, from our comparative analysis, it was apparent that differences in the expressions of genes involved in these processes represented background differences between the WT ovary and WT testis tissue. This is an essential problem in the transcriptional function of DMY, but it beyond the scope of this study. Further, we may investigate developmental stages of gonad or different tissue of the HPG axis to explain the problem.The main differentially expressed genes between WT_F_OV and TA_F_OV, were genes in the wnt receptor signaling pathway (Predicted: syntabbulin-like, axin-2-like) (Dataset 4). In mammals, beta-arrestin-1-like gene regulated IGF-1 affects human reproductive endocrinology. The medaka homolog of beta-arrestin-1-like gene was detected 10 times in the RNA-seq data. The high expression of the beta-arrestin-1-like gene could provide some clues to the mechanism of the degradation of the testis and the development of the ovary in XY DMY mutant females. Lhr and Forkhead box O5 factor were also differentially expressed between TA_F_OV and WT_F_OV. Lhr is the luteinizing hormone receptor and Forkhead box O5 factor plays an important role in metabolism and cell differentiation. The low expression of lhr and Forkhead box O5 factor might affect the incomplete ovary function of the XY DMY mutant female. The majority of genes in wnt signal pathway, such as Wnt genes, PRCK genes, FZD genes and DKK were differentially expressed between WT_M_TE and TA_F_OV (Dataset 1), it implied that the wnt signaling pathway is the main regulation pathway during male-to-female sex reversal process. In addition, the genes in wnt signaling pathway, especially Wnt1 and PRCK, were up-expressed in XYDMY− mutants compared with WT XY males and down-expressed compared with WT XX females (Dataset 1 and 4). These results implied that the wnt signaling pathway also contributed primarily to the ovarian development, reduced fertility and ovarian maturation in the XYDMY− mutants. Interestingly, PRCKA and DKK were up-expressed in TA_F_OV, whether compared with WT_M_TE (Dataset 1) or compared with WT_F_OV (Dataset 4). In summary, these results implied that the wnt signaling pathway is the root of sex reversal, the incomplete ovarian function and reduced fertility in the XYDMY− mutants.The research animals are provided with the best possible care and treatment and are under the care of a specialized technician. All procedures were approved by the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences and were conducted in accordance with the Guiding Principles for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.The Orange strain of medaka was used in this study (Originally from National University of Singapore). Medakas were maintained in aquaria under an artificial 14-h light/10-h dark photoperiod at 26 °C in the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Science30.TALEN were assembled and transferred into vectors pCS2-KKR and pCS2-ELD28. To improve the germline integration efficiency, the zebrafish nanos-3′UTR was separately inserted into the 3′ end of the pCS2-ELD/KKR vector to replace the SV40 UTR using NotI and XbaI.The final TALEN plasmids were linearized using Not1 and the mMessage mMachine SP6 kit (Ambion) was used to synthesize mRNAs. TALENs mRNAs (half left and half right monomer mRNAs) were microinjected into medaka embryos at the one cell stage.72 hours after microinjection, TALEN targeted embryos were pooled for genomic DNA extraction (10 embryos for each pool). PCR was performed using primers DMY F and DMY R; PCR products were purified from the agarose gel using a gel extraction kit (QIAGEN). Amplicons harboring the targeted gene fragments were sub-cloned into pMD-18T using TA cloning (Takara) and single colonies were examined by PCR using primers DMY F, DMY F1 and DMY R. The PCR conditions were as follows: 5 min at 95 °C; followed by 30 cycles of 15 sec at 95 °C, 20 sec at 52 °C, 30 sec at 72 °C; and a final step of 5 min at 72 °C. PCR products were electrophoresed in a 2% agarose gel and verified by DNA sequencing.The criteria of the novel program for determining off-target sites were that the 0 position of the EBEs must be T, from 1 to 10 mismatch bases occur in the pairs of EBEs and the spacer between the two putative EBE regions is less than 100 bp, because it has been suggested that longer spacers interfere with Fok I dimerization.TALEN-injected medaka embryos were raised to sexual maturity. F0 DMY mutated females were crossed with wild-type males; and F1 embryos were collected at 72 hours post fertilization. Genomic DNA was extracted from ten randomly pooled embryos to assess mutagenesis at the TALEN-targeted site by PCR and sequencing. F1 embryos were individually collected at 7 days post fertilization (dpf) and genomic DNA was extracted from each individual embryo to assess mutagenesis at the TALEN-targeted site by PCR and sequencing.FISH was performed using a DMY fragment labelled by PCR (Dmy Probe F: 5′-TGCCCAAGTGCTCCC-3′; Dmy Probe R: 5′-CCCCTTTTGTCTGTCCTCT-3′) with digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Boehringer). Standard nick translation using biotin-16-dUTP and digoxigenin-11-dUTP12 separately labeled the probe. Before hybridizing with denatured medaka mitotic chromosomes, the probe was denatured and preannealed in the presence of excess genomic DNA. Rhodamine-conjugated avidin and antidigoxigenin (monoclonal)-conjugated fluorescein (Sigma) were used to detect the hybridization sites for the probe simultaneously. 4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to counterstain the chromosomes. EASY FISH 1.0 software (Applied Spectral Imaging, Mannheim, Germany) was used to capture and display digitized images of the rhodamine signals on DAPI-stained chromosomes.The TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) was used to extract total RNA from pooled organs of three adult medaka fish, according to the supplier’s recommendation. After DNase treatment, reverse transcription was performed with 2 or 4 mg RNA by using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random primers. cDNA from 10 ng (actin) to 200 ng (adult organs) of total RNA was used for PCR with gene-specific primers: Ola Actin, Ola DMY (Dmy F1 and PG17.89 primers12).For the histological analysis, identified mutants from the F2 generation of medaka were dissected into head and body segments (N = 15). Each dissected head was used to determine the genetic sex. The body portions were fixed overnight in Bouin’s fixative solution and then embedded in paraffin. Cross-sections were cut serially at 5 μm thickness and after hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining; the images were obtained under a microscope (Eppendorf).Medaka gonads (divided into WT-F, WT-M and TA-F, 10 samples pooled in each group, respectively) were collected for RNA extraction. TRIZOL (Invitrogen) performed the total RNA extraction, following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA library construction was then performed by BGI- Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China then constructed the RNA library. Before library construction, the integrity of RNA samples was confirmed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer; 10 μg of total RNA was used for isolation of mRNA with Sera-mag Magnetic Oligo (dT) beads from Illumina.The TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) was used to isolate total RNA from embryos. The SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and the Real-Time PCR System (ABI 7900) measured gene transcription. The actb1 gene was used as the endogenous control gene for normalizing expression of the target gene. Triplicate technical replicates were performed for duplicate cultures.Blast2GO software (http://www.blast2go.de) was used to perform BLAST searching, mapping and annotation of proteins differentially expressed53. BINGO 2.4454 plug-in in the Cytoscape platform55 was used to perform functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed proteins to determine the significantly enriched GO terms and relevant proteins. Enrichment analysis of GO term assignment was performed in reference to the entire annotated P. tricornutum proteome. The corrected P values were derived from a hypergeometric test followed by Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate correction. A corrected P < 0.05 was regarded as significant.Accession codes: All RNA-seq data submited to GEO, GEO accession: GSE62700.How to cite this article: Luo, D. et al.

The teleost fish swamp eel undergoes sex reversal naturally and is an ideal model for vertebrate sexual development. However, the importance of proteome-wide scanning for gonad reversal was not previously determined. We report a 2-D electrophoresis analysis of three gonad types of proteomes during sex reversal. MS/MS analysis revealed a group of differentially expressed proteins during ovary to ovotestis to testis transformation. Cbx3 is up-regulated during gonad reversal and is likely to have a role in spermatogenesis. Rab37 is down-regulated during the reversal and is mainly associated with oogenesis. Both Cbx3 and Rab37 are linked up in a protein network. These datasets in gonadal proteomes provide a new resource for further studies in gonadal development.Sexual dimorphism is a common feature in vertebrates. Separation of two sexes promotes the speed of species evolution. The mystery of sex determination has puzzled us for a century. A variety of mechanisms are engaged in sex determination in vertebrates, mainly including genetic sex determination (GSD), in which the sex of offspring is determined by a sex chromosome or key genes; environmental sex determination (ESD) or both GSD and ESD jointly. Male heterogametic XX/XY in mammals and female heterogametic ZZ/ZW in birds are typical GSD systems, while no heteromorphic sex chromosomes exist in many vertebrates, such as the teleost fishes. Moreover, some fish species undergo sex reversal naturally. For instance, male swamp eel (Monopterus albus) is transformed from female through an intersex stage1,2, which is an excellent model system for exploring sexual development.In mammals, Sry is a key sex-determining gene on the Y chromosome3,4. Mouse contained the Sry can develop to male; absence of this gene will develop as female. Sry can directly regulate its downstream gene Sox9 through binding to its gonad-specific enhancer by synergistic action with Sf15. Interaction of Sox9 and Sf1 positively regulates the Sertoli cell-specific expression of the Amh6. Loss Sox9 impairs sex cord development and Sox8 promotes Sox9 function in testis differentiation7. Sex determination is also involved in female determining factors, such as the WNT and FGF pathways. Fgf9 loss will lead male to female reversal8. Fgf9 represses Wnt4, thus promoting male sex determination9. Thus, the male determination requires turning on male genes (such as Sox9) and off female genes (such as Wnt4).In non-mammals, there is no Sry gene and their sex determination mechanisms are complex. Downstream regulatory gene Dmrt1 (Dsx- and mab-3 related transcription factor 1) in sex determination is evolutionarily conserved, while upstream sex-determining pathways are diverse. The DM domain genes play a similar role in sexual development from fly to worm to mammals10. In mice, Dmrt1 can promote testis differentiation11. In birds, Z-linked gene DMRT1 is required for male sex determination12, while W-linked DM-W is essential for primary ovary development in Xenopus13. Sex development in the teleost fish is more complex. Only DM gene that controls sex is Dmy/Dmrt1y on the Y chromosome in medaka, a duplicated copy of Dmrt1 on an autosome14,15. Recently, four novel sex-determining candidate genes have been identified from different fish species, amhy, Gsdf, Amhr2 and sdY16,17,18,19. Amh and Amhr are already known relating to sexual development in mammals, but the Gsdf and sdY are the new ones first identified in fishes20. Together, sex determination and differentiation in fish are complex because of diverse range of species and common molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown.Taking advantage of the sex reversal characteristic of the swamp eel, we have previously identified six Dmrt genes (Dmrt1, Dmrt2, Dmrt2b, Dmrt3, Dmrt4 and Dmrt5); observed that these Dmrt genes were up-regulated during gonad reversal21,22. We have also identified Androgen receptor (AR) gene and two Sox9 genes (Sox9a1 and Sox9a2) in swamp eel and shown that AR is up-regulated during gonadal transformation, has a restricted androgen-dependent transactivation function. Moreover, both Sox9a1/Sox9a2 can interact with AR and regulate AR transactivation23,24. Despite these advances, mechanistically overall view of sex reversal in this species needs to be studied. Herein, using a comparative proteomics approach, we report a proteome-wide scan for key genes for gonad reversal in swamp eel. 2-D electrophoresis analysis of gonadal proteomes revealed a group of differentially expressed proteins during ovary to ovotestis to testis transformation. One up-regulated gene Cbx3 and one down-regulated gene Rab37 during gonad reversal were further analyzed. These data in gonadal proteomes provide new resource for further studies in gonadal development.To screen the differentially expressed genes during gonad reversal, 2D-electrophoresis was used to isolate the differentially expressed protein spots among ovary, ovotestis and testis. HE staining showed a typic ovotestis structure during the intersex stage, ovary and testis besides (Fig. 1a). Comparative analysis among the 2D gel images of gonad tissues showed many differentially expressed protein spots (Fig. 1b, Fig. S1). There were five spots highly expressed in ovary, three spots in ovotestis, sixteen in testis, twenty-four in both ovary and ovotestis and seventeen in both testis and ovotestis. These obviously differential spots were subjected to mass spectrum identification. Over 80 differentially expressed proteins were identified (Supplementary Table S1).Identification of the differentially expressed proteins among three gonad types.a) H.E. staining of ovary, ovotestis and testis tissues. b) The 2D protein electrophoresis shows the differentially expressed protein spots among these gonads. The red circles on the 2D gels display the differentially expressed protein spots. Circus plots show the numbers of five kinds of proteins identified: highly expressed in males (16); highly expressed in ovotestis (3); highly expressed in ovary (5); highly expressed in both ovotestis and testis (17); highly expressed in both ovotestis and ovary (24). Detail information of protein spots is showed in Table S1.To confirm these differentially expressed proteins, we further analyzed ten proteins with high score in MS analysis (Rab37, Rab1A, Pentraxin, Enolase, Rab35, Myosin, Glutathione S-transferase M, Triosephosphate isomerase B, Ferritin and Cbx3). Their corresponding cDNAs were cloned using degenerate PCR and RACE. RT-PCR analysis showed that Rab35, Myosin, Ferritin and Cbx3 are highly expressed in testis tissues of swamp eel, zebrafish and mouse (Fig. 2; Fig. S2). Rab37 and Pentraxin were highly expressed in ovary of swamp eel (Fig. 2; Fig. S2). Tepp was identified in MS analysis of swamp eel testis; unfortunately we did not clone the full-length cDNA from both swamp eel and zebrfaish using degenerate PCR. However, it was specifically expressed in mouse testis three weeks postnatal and located in the nucleus (Fig. S3).RT-PCR of the differentially expressed genes in gonads of swamp eel, zebrafish and mouse.cDNAs of the differentially expressed genes were identified and non-quantitative RT-PCR was used to examine their expression levels in gonads. Homologs of mouse and zebrafish were also analyzed for comparision. Myosin, Ferritin, Cbx3 are highly expressed in testis; Glutathione S-transferase M, triosephosphate isomerase B are highly expressed in ovotestis. Rab37 and Pentraxin are highly expressed in ovary. Protein expression levels of three spots for each of these genes are listed in Fig. S4. Some of the genes have no difference between gonads, like Rab1A and Enolase. PCR product for each gene has been run under the same experimental conditions and same sizes of gel images have been used for all genes.To investigate expression profile of genes highly expressed in testis, we characterized the Cbx3 gene of swamp eel. Sequence alignments showed that the Cbx3 was highly conserved from fishes, frogs, chickens to mammals (Fig. 3a). Phylogenetic tree depicted the Cbx family and Cbx3 gene of swamp eel was clustered into the vertebrate branch, especially into the teleost fish group (Fig. 3b). RT-PCR analysis of adult tissues in swamp eel showed that Cbx3 was dominantly expressed in testis, lower in ovotestis and the lowest in ovary (Fig. 3c). The expression was also detected in heart and brain (Fig. 3c). The testis expression of the Cbx3 was further confirmed at protein level by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3d). Immunohistochemistry indicated that Cbx3 was expressed in spermatogonia, spermatocytes and sperm cells of swamp eel (Fig. 3e). The signals were hardly detected in ovary. Immunofluorescence analysis of Cbx3 in mouse testis further confirmed the expression patterns (Fig. 3f). These results indicated that Cbx3 is up-regulated during gonad reversal and is likely to have a role in spermatogenesis in both fishes and mammals.Identification and expression of Cbx3 gene of swamp eel.a). Protein sequence alignments of Cbx3 from human, mouse, cattle, chicken, frog, salmon, zebrafish and swamp eel show an evolutionarily conservation. GenBank access number for swamp eel Cbx3 is KP054389. b) Phylogenetic tree depicts the Cbx family from human, mouse, cattle, chicken, frog, salmon, zebrafish and swamp eel.

The bar, 20 μm.To explore expression profile of genes highly expressed in ovary, we characterized the Rab37 gene of swamp eel. Rab37 was a highly conserved gene in worm, fish and mouse (Fig. 4a). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the eel Rab37 was clustered into the Rab37 branch in vertebrates (Fig. 4b). In adult tissues, Rab37 was mainly expressed in gonads and brain of swamp eel (Fig. 4c). During gonad reversal, Rab37 was down-regulated from ovary through ovotestis to testis as indicated using RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, which showed a consistent expression trend (Fig. 4c,d). Immunofluorescence analysis in three gonad types showed that Rab37 was markedly expressed in all stages of follicles in ovary (Fig. 4e). In ovotestis, Rab37 expression was still detected in the degraded ova, while in testis Rab37 had the lowest expression in gonadal epithelium (Fig. 4e). These results suggested that Rab37 is down-regulated during gonad reversal and is mainly associated with oogenesis.Identification and expression of Rab37 gene of swamp eel.a). Protein sequence alignments of Rab37 of mouse, salmon, swamp eel and worm. GenBank access number for swam eel Rab37 is KP054393. b) Phylogenetic tree depicts the Rab37 (blue circle) and Rab35 (green circle) proteins from human, mouse, chicken, frog, latimeria, zebrafish and swamp eel. The numbers on the branches represent the boot-strap values from 1000 replicates obtained using the maximum-likelihood method (first value) and the neighbor-joining method (second value). c) RT-PCR analysis of Rab37 in adult tissues from each sex of swamp eel. PCR product for each gene has been run under the same experimental conditions and same sizes of gel images have been used for all genes. d) Western blot analysis shows Rab37 expression in three types of gonads during gonad reversal of swamp eel. Three repeat experiments from each gonad type were performed, which showed a consistent down-regulation trend from ovary through ovotestis to testis . The protein gels have been run under the same experimental conditions and same sizes of gel images have been used for all proteins. e) Immunofluorescence analysis in three gonad types. Rab37 is expressed in the gonadal epithelium in testis (red triangle), but not in sperms. In ovotestis, Rab37 is expressed in the epithelium (red triangle) and degraded ovary (od). Rab37 has the most obvious expression in ovary, especially in developing oocytes and mature oocytes (o). The bar, 100 μm.Because the expressions of Cbx3 and Rab37 are inversely correlated during gonad reversal, their interaction relationship was further investigated. All interactive proteins involved in both Cbx3 and Rab37 were searched in an online interaction repository BioGRID. In the interactive map, Cbx3, Rab37 and Pax3 were identified in the MS analysis. During gonad reversal, Rab37 was down-regulated, while Cbx3 was up-regulated, suggesting their functions in gonad differentiation. Their relationship was further linked up by the UBC protein (polyubiquitin-C), indicating a role of the ubiquitination protein degradation during gonad reversal (Fig. 5).Protein network map of the differentially expressed Rab37 and Cbx3 during gonad reversal.The color of nodes represents expression level relative to Actin among ovary, ovotestis and testis as the color panel indicated. Protein relationships are obtained from BioGrid. All proteins are the swamp eel homologs. Rab37, Cbx3 and Pax3 are identified in the MS analysis.The teleost fish species is composed of more than 24,000 species accounting for more than half of extant vertebrate species and displays remarkable variation in physiological adaptations, especially in sexual development. Swamp eel is a teleost fish with a natural sex reversal characteristic. Three gonad types (ovary, ovotestis and testis) are obviously detected during sex reversal. In the present study, we have performed a proteome-wide analysis of three gonad types in the swamp eel. The datasets of differentially expressed genes during the sex reversal provide basic data for in depth studies of functions and evolution of sexual development.We have identified a large group of highly expressed in testis. Cbx3 is a chromotin binding protein and have a conserved function in the formation and maintenance of heterochromatin. Cbx3 can regulate the efficient RNA processing through recruitment of the splicing machinery25. Alternative splicing occurs in testis more frequently than in ovary, thus we speculate that Cbx3 has a similar function in RNA processing in gonads, based on its upregulation during gonad reversal. Unlike Cbx3, Tepp is testis specifically expressed, especially in the late stage of testis development, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis.Of particular interest, we have also detected some genes highly expressed in ovotestis. The genes expressed in ovotestis are likely to have two functions. One is for regulation of the ovary apoptosis and another is to promote testis differentiation. We have identified two genes highly expressed in ovotestis: Glutathione S-trasferase M and Triosephosophate isomerase B. These two genes are all highly expressed in testis in both zebrafish and mouse, suggesting a conserved role in promoting testis differentiation or inhibiting ovary development.We have also identified a group of genes highly expressed in ovary. Pentraxin is a multifunctional gene involved in female fertility, matrix deposition, innate immunity and inflammation26,27. However, Pentraxin’s function was poorly understood in fish. We showed that the gene is down-regulated during gonad reversal and evolutionarily conserved from fishes to mammals, suggesting a role in ovary development in vertebrates. Rab37 was first identified from the secretory granules in bone marrow mast cells28, was localized in various vesicles, such as dense-core vesicles in in PC12 cells29, insulin secretory granules30 and Weibel-Palade bodies31. It regulates TNF-alpha and insulin secretion32,33. RAB37 also plays an important role in endothelial cell function and embryogenesis in zebrafish34 and is involved in tumor cell growth35,36,37,38. Here we suggest another function of Rab37 in ovary development. Because Rab37 is a highly conserved gene from fishes to mammals, we speculate that Rab37 is likely to play a conserved role in follicle development in vertebrates.During gonad reversal, Cbx3 was up-regulated, while Rab37 was down-regulated, suggesting their respective functions in gonad differentiation from ovary to ovotestis to testis. Notably, both Cbx3 and Rab37 are linked to ubiquitination by the UBC protein (polyubiquitin-C). Indeed, apoptosis and protein degradation during gonad reversal is an important process39, which is likely responsible for ovary degradation and spermatogenesis during sex reversal.There are also some limitations in our 2D results. Due to insufficiency of the fish protein databases, we still have a lot of peptides, which can not match any known proteins. Fish species have their special gene pools including swamp eel. 2D resolution is not precise enough, for example, Rab37 identified from ovary-only spots is expressed highly in ovary and ovotestis and also lower in testis. There would be also sampling errors as differences of growth and development among individuals of same sex. Thus further verification and functional analysis are needed to completely understand the molecular mechanisms of sex reversal.The swamp eels (rice field eels, Monopterus albus) were purchased from Wuhan markets in China. Their sexes were identified by microscopic analysis of gonad sections with a crystal microtome (CM1850, Leica, Bensheim, Germany). The animals were treated in accordance with the Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals. The present study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Wuhan University.The swamp eels were first washed by ddH2O and then disinfected by 75% alcohol on the surface. Each type of sex gonad was collected from three individuals as the triplicate. About 500 mg ~ 1000 mg tissues were collected from one individual and immediately immerged into cold PBS on ice. After identification of the sex type, the samples were cut into small segments, washed by PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (7M Urea, 2M Thiourea, 4% CHAPS) with protease inhibitors added (Roche). After homogenization by a homogenizer (Feiyi, Wuhan, China) (the volume of particles are less than 1 mm3), the samples were sonicated by the Sonic Dismembrator (Thermofisher, #FB120220) for 10 min (10 s on, 50 s off, 600 W) on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C, transferred the supernatant to a clean tube and normalized to the same concentration (30 mg/ml) by BCA Protein Assay Kit (#23225, Thermo Fisher).Using the similar method40, the IPG strips (Bio-Rad) were rehydrated for 12 h (30 V, 20 °C) with total ~500 μg proteins and then separated by 1D IEF for 500 V for 1 h, 1000 V for 1 h, 8000 V for 10 h in PROTEAN IEF System (Bio-Rad). The strips were then balanced in the buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH8.8, 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2%SDS, 10 mg/ml DTT, a little bromophenol blue) for 15 min, twice with gently shaking. Proteins were further separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels using PROTEAN II xi Cell (Bio-Rad). Each type of gonads contains three individuals and run three gels separately. After fixed in fixing buffer and stained in Coomassie Blue solution, the gels were washed by H2O for several times, then gel images were taken by Image Scanner (Bio-rad) (Fig. S1a).The valid spot analysis was performed using ImageJ (version J2, NIH, Maryland, US) and following the protocols41. The intensities of spots were compared among gonad samples, using one gonad type as a control (Fig. S1b). Data were prepared as excel and image files. Microsoft excel software was used to analyze excel files. The statistical significance of image analysis was determined by the Student’s t-test. The chosen spots were picked up from the 2-DE gel and placed into 96-well plates. After washing twice in ddH2O, the gels were washed three times in 25 mM NH4HCO3 and then 50% CH3CN for 30 min within rotating. After dehydrating in 100% CH3CN and air-dry for 1 h, the samples were suspended in 1.5 uM trypsin (Sigma) with 25 mM NH4HCO3. After digesting at 37 °C overnight, 96-well plates were centrifuged and supernatant can be used for MS/MS analysis.The digested peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS (Bruker-Daltonics AutoFlex TOF-TOF LIFT Mass Spectrometer, Bruker-Daltonics) or LC-ESI-MS/MS (LTQ XL, Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA). The proteins were identified by the search program Mascot software ( http://www.matrixscience.com) within the NCBInr database. Two criteria of candidate proteins are indispensable, the protein scores should be more than 60 in MALDI-TOF/TOF MS and at least three peptides matched one same protein in LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis.Total RNAs were extracted from tissues by Trizol reagent from Invitrogen (CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. All the total RNAs were digested by RNAse-free DNase I and purified. M-MLV enzyme (Promega, WI, USA) was used to reverse transcribe total RNA into cDNAs with primer CDSIII, 5′-ATTCTAGAGGCCGAGGCGGCCGACATG-d(T)30N_1 N-3′(N = A/G/C/T, N_1 = A/G/C).Degenerate primers (Table S2) were designed to amplify the conserved regions based on sequence information of other species, especially the fish species. PCR cycling conditions were: 95 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles, each with 30 s, 95 °C; 30 s, 58 °C; and 30 s, 72 °C; 72 °C for 2 min. PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T-easy clone (Promega) and sequenced.The cDNA templates were prepared from tissues of swamp eel, zebrafish and mouse. Specific primers for swamp eel were designed based on sequencs produced by degenerate PCR. For RACE PCR, the cDNAs were purified by phenol/chloroform (1:1), the 100% alcohol precipitated for 10mins, 70% alcohol washed for one time and then treated with dCTP using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) (Promega) for 15 min to add poly C at the terminal. Use the specific primers and CDSIII (for 3′ RACE) or 5MDP (for 5′ RACE, sequence: 5′ GCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGGGGGGGG 3′) to amplify the terminal fragment. PCRs were performed under the conditions: 95 °C, 30 s; 60 °C,30 s; and 72 °C, 30 s for 25-28 cycles (Semi-quantitative PCR) or 35-40 cycles (for RACE). The fragments were cloned into pGEM T-easy (Promega) and sequenced. The detail primers and conditions were listed in Table S2.The whole extracts from tissues were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore, MA). The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat milk powders in TBST (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with the first antibody at 4 °C over night and then with an AP-labeled or HRP-labeled secondary antibody. The immunoreactive signal was revealed by NBT/BCIP regents or the ECL plus detecting reagents. Anti-β-actin and anti-Cbx3 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech (CA, USA). Rab37 antibody was produced by Beijing Protein Innovation (Beijing, China).COS-7 cells were cultured in DMEM (Cat# SH30022.01B, Hyclone, Beijing, China) with 10% FBS (Cat# SV30087.02, HyClone), 37 °C, 5% CO2. PEGFP-N1 was used to construct a fused protein with Tepp and transfect into COS-7 cells. After 48 h, the cells were fixed with methanol for 20 min at −20 °C and stained with DAPI. Images were taken by a confocal fluorescence microscope (Olympus, FV1000, Tokyo, Japan).Tissues were embedded in OCT (optimal cutting temperature) medium (Feiyi, Wuhan China) and frozen at−20 °C, then cut into serial 7 μm sections with a crystal microtome (Leica). For immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescent analysis, sections were permeabilized with 0.1% v/v Triton X-100 for 15 min, washed with PBS for three times and blocked at room temperature for 30 min in 5% v/v BSA. Slides were incubated at 4 °C overnight in the first antibody. After 5 times of washing with PBS, AP-labeled (CBX3 in swamp eel), FITC (Rab37 in swamp eel) or Cy3 (Cbx3 in mouse) conjugated secondary antibody was applied for 1 h at room temperature. The nuclei were stained with Hoechst33258. Images were taken with a confocal fluorescence microscope (Olympus, FV1000, Tokyo, Japan).The sequences of the other species were downloaded from NCBI. These sequences were aligned using the ClustalW program. The neighbour-joining (NJ, 1,000 runs) and maximum-likelihood (ML, 100 or 1,000 runs) methods (Phylip, version 3.6) were used to perform phylogenetic analysis.We used Tblatsn program to search the homologous genes of the swamp eel (E < 0.0001) from human protein database. All human protein sequences were downloaded from Ensembl (GRCh37). The program of Cytoscape42 (version 3.1.1) was used to visualize and analyze the interaction network. Gene relationships were obtained from BioGrid43 (version 3.2) and Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD)44 (release 9) and input into Cytoscape with undirected connection. Finally, the network was displayed using force-directed layout algorithms.How to cite this article: Sheng, Y. et al.

 4, Article number: 6884 (2014) Cite this article362 Accesses32 Citations0 AltmetricMetricsWe isolated the complete Foxl2 (Foxl2a) cDNA from the Monopterus albus ovary. An alignment of known Foxl2 amino-acid sequences confirmed the conservation of the Foxl2 open reading frame, especially the forkhead domain and C-terminal region. The expression of Foxl2 was detected in the brain, eyes and gonads. A high level of Foxl2 expression in the ovary before sex reversal, but its transcripts decreased sharply when the gonad developed into the ovotestis and testis. The correlation between the Foxl2 expression and the process of sex development revealed the important function of Foxl2 during the sex reversal of M. albus. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that Foxl2 was expressed abundantly in granulosa cells and in the interstitial cells of the ovotestis and testis. These results suggest that Foxl2 plays a pivotal role in the development and maintenance of ovarian function. Foxl2 may be also involved in the early development of testis and the development of ocular structures of M. albus.Forkhead transcription factors play a critical role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation1.They are also involved in several other biological processes, including tissue development, establishment of the body axis, metabolic processes and the determination and differentiation of cell types2,3. In many cases, forkhead transcription factors are also responsible for various processes during embryonic development and adult metabolism2.Forkhead box L2 (Foxl2) is a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors, characterized by a conserved 100-amino-acid domain called “forkhead box”4. Although the Foxl2 is highly conserved across divergent taxonomic groups5, the C-terminal region is more conserved than the N-terminal region outside the DNA-binding forkhead domain6. Mammalian Foxl2 contains a polyalanine tract and other low-complexity repeats absent from the fish sequences5. Foxl2 mutation in human leads to the blepharophimosis ptosis epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), which is characterized by eyelid malformations and premature ovarian failure (POF)7. Foxl2 was observed in the developing eyelids and perioptic mesenchyme of mouse7. It is reported that males and females of mouse lacking Foxl2 are small and show distinctive craniofacial morphology with upper eyelids absent8. Mouse Foxl2 has been also detected in the pituitary9 and developing ovary10. Recently, many studies demonstrated that Foxl2 is a putative transcription factor in the early development of the female vertebrate gonad and is involved in adult ovarian function6,11,12. In genetic program, somatic testis determination was activated in an XX gonads mouse lacking Foxl2 from meiotic prophase oocytes, implying the pivotal function of Foxl2 to repress the male gene pathway at several stages of female gonadal differentiation13. Foxl2 is also involved in the differentiation of granulosa cells of gonad and the maintenance of ovarian function, as well as the transcriptional regulation of other genes during gonadal differentiation in fish14,15,16.Estrogens have important roles in sexual differentiation and sex changes in fish17,18. Aromatase, encoded by cyp19a1a, is responsible for 17β-estradiol (E2) synthesis by catalyzing the conversion of androgens to estrogens19. Aromatase and Foxl2 co-localize in the adult ovaries of medaka (Oryzias latipes)14 and Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus)16. The expression profile of Foxl2 also correlates strongly with aromatase activities in the gonads during the sexual differentiation of the chicken (Gallus gallus)20. These results suggest that Foxl2 is related to the sexual differentiation of fish and other vertebrates through the transcriptional regulation of the cyp19a1a gene.Rice-field eel Monopterus albus, which belongs to the family Synbranchidae in the order Synbranchiformes (Neoteleostei, Teleostei, Vertebrata), is a hermaphroditic protogynous freshwater fish species that undergoes sexual reversal from a functional female to a male21. Some genes related to sex determination and differentiation have been identified in M. albus, including cyp19a1a22, Sox923, Dmrt124 and Jnk125. The complete genomic sequences of Foxl2 is available for the pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes), green spotted puffer (Tetraodon nigroviridis) and zebrafish (Danio rerio)15. Given the detections of Foxl2 transcripts in ovary, it is probably involved in ovarian development in mammal7,10, birds20 and teleost14,15,16. Although there are many studies which investigated the roles of other sex-related genes in M. albus, few studies of Foxl2 function have been reported in this hermaphrodite fish species. To investigate whether Foxl2 is involved in ovarian differentiation and development in M. albus, as in other vertebrates, we isolated the full-length Foxl2 cDNA from M. albus and analyzed its expression pattern and protein localization in the gonads during sex reversal using real-time RT–PCR and immunohistochemistry.The M. albusFoxl2 (Foxl2a, KC823043) cDNA is 2037 bp long, which comprises a 263-bp 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR), an 853-bp 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) containing two typical poly(A) signals and an open reading frame (ORF) (921 bp). The ORF encodes a putative 306-amino-acid containing the 100-amino-acid conserved sequence of the forkhead family (Fig. 1). The similarity of the M. albusFoxl2 nucleotide sequence to those of other vertebrates was determined with BLASTN at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) web server (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). The result exhibited high levels of identity, especially with the teleosts, including the honeycomb grouper (Epinephelus merra, 86%), spotted butterfish (Scatophagus argus, 85%), three-spot wrasse (Halichoeres trimaculatus, 82%) and peacock bass (Cichla monoculus, 82%). A high degree of similarity, E. merra (95.1%), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus, 94.4%) and H. trimaculatus (94.1%), was also apparent when the percentage identities of the corresponding amino-acid sequences were calculated with Clustal W (Fig. 2). Except the forkhead domain, which displayed almost complete conservation among these fish species, the C-terminal region of Foxl2 was more strongly conserved than the N-terminal region. Like the Foxl2 proteins of other fishes, there is no polyalanine tract or proline or glycine repeat in the M. albus (Fig. 3). A phylogenetic tree was constructed with 11 Foxl2 nucleotide sequences, which clustered into two separate branches when mammalian Foxl2 were used as the outgroup. M. albusFoxl2 clusters with E. merra displayed the close relationship between them, with 74 bootstrap support (Fig. 4).Nucleotide and deduced amino-acid sequences of M. albus Foxl2.The amino-acid sequence is shown with the standard one-letter code below the nucleotide sequence.

The level in the ovary was much higher than that in the testis and ovotestis and there was no obvious difference between the testis and ovotestis. High levels of Foxl2 expression were also observed in the whole eyes and brain. However, the expression of Foxl2 was barely detected in the other tested tissues (Fig. 5).RT–PCR analysis of Foxl2 mRNA in various tissues of M. albus.E, eye; M, muscle; Bl, blood; H, heart; Sk, skin; K, kidney; Sp, spleen; I, intestine; L, liver; Br, brain; T, testis; O-T, ovotestis; O, ovary; −, negative control; 18S rRNA, internal control. The figure was cropped, for uncropped figure, see figure S1 &S2, supplementary file.To investigate the relationship between Foxl2 expression and sex reversal in M. albus, we analyzed the expression of Foxl2 in the seven different developmental stages of gonads using real-time RT–PCR. The highest level of Foxl2 was detected in the ovaries, especially in the fourth-stage ovaries (♀IV). However, its expression decreased sharply in the first-stage ovotestis (♀/♂I) and decreased continuously in the second- and third-stage ovotestis (♀/♂II and ♀/♂III), as well as the testis (Fig. 6).Copies of Foxl2 transcripts in different phases of M. albus gonadal development.♀, ovaries; ♀/♂, ovotestis; ♂, testis.In the ovary, Foxl2 immunoreactivity was detected abundantly in the granulosa cells around the oocytes and immature oocytes, but not in the mature oocytes (Fig. 7A, B). In the ovotestis, positive signals were observed in each type of cell, especially in the immature oocytes and interstitial cells (Fig. 7C, D). Foxl2 expression was also detected in the interstitial cells in testes, but not in sperm (Fig. 7E, F). No positive signals were observed in the negative control (Fig. 7G–I).Immunohistochemical analysis of Foxl2 in different phases of M. albus gonadal development.(A–F) Immunohistochemical analysis of Foxl2 in the (A and B) ovaries, (C and D) ovotestis and (E and F) testis.

(G–I) Negative controls.Two Foxl2 paralogs which are named Foxl2a (Foxl2) and Foxl2b (Foxl3) have been reported in some teleost species5,26. They are also identified by blast against the available fish genome database, which is in agreement with the genome duplication event in fish27. Foxl2a and Foxl2b in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were expressed specifically in the ovary, but displayed different temporal expression patterns5. However, the mRNA levels of Foxl2 in ovary and Foxl3 in testis point to a strong sexual dimorphism and vary significantly during the reproductive cycle in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax)26. Unlike above species, only Foxl2 was cloned in the ovary of M. albus in this study. The same phenomena have been reported in some fish species14,15,28. Due to the complexity and shortage of date in expression pattern of fish Foxl2b (Foxl3), a systematic investigation on Foxl3 need to be carried out.The C-terminal region and the forkhead domain of Foxl2 are strongly conserved among different vertebrates. The functions of these two regions may have been conserved throughout evolution, whereas the N-terminal region has evolved under weaker conservation pressure29. The forkhead domain of Foxl2 is responsible for the nuclear import of this protein and contains a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS, typically RRRRRMKR) at C-terminus, like other FOX proteins6,30,31. Homopolymeric runs of amino acids, such as A, G and P, were present in the mammalian proteins but not in those of non-mammalian vertebrates. A phylogenetic analysis supported the strong evolutionary conservation of Foxl2 in fish and the close genetic relationship between M. albus and E. merra.Foxl2 was mainly expressed in the brain, eyes and gonads of M. albus, with the highest level of expression in the ovary. The gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor gene (Gnrhr), which contains a site bound by Foxl2, AP-1 and Smads, can be activated by Foxl2 in mouse11. The high level of Foxl2 transcript was found in the M. albus brain, indicating that the Gnrhr may be regulated by Foxl2 on the transcriptional level. Fish Foxl2 is involved in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis due to the detection of Foxl2 expression in the hypothalamus, pituitary and gonad15,32. In M. albus, the transcription of Foxl2 was much higher in gonad than that in brain. It is implied that Foxl2 probably executes its functions via the transcriptional regulation of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone-gonadotropin-sex steroid pathway.The mutation of Foxl2 leads to BPES, characterized by malformations of the eyelid and premature ovarian failure in human7. Compared to BPES, mouse lacking Foxl2 were born with open and necrotizing eyes, coupled with severe eyelid hypoplasia8. Foxl2 expression was concentrated in the perioptic mesenchyme7. Lower levels of Foxl2 expression were also detected in the lens fibers of the eyes7. Consequently, such expression pattern of Foxl2 could be required for the eyelid formation and the development of other ocular structures in mouse7. Foxl2 expression in dogfish (Scyliorhinus canicula) was firstly detected in the mesenchyme around the eyes and then restricted to the underlying mesenchyme at the outer edges of the developing eyelids33. As in other fish27,32,34, Foxl2 was highly expressed in the eyes of M. albus. This expressive pattern manifests the conserved functions of Foxl2 among different species. It is implied that Foxl2 is probably involved in the development of other ocular structures because of the apparent absence of eyelids from most fish.In general, Foxl2 is used to be considered as a good marker of ovarian differentiation because of its high-level expression in the ovary reported in several vertebrates29. Although Foxl2 expression has been detected in the adult testis of several species, the levels of Foxl2 in the testis were all significantly lower than that in the ovary in G. gallus20, the southern catfish (Silurus meridionalis)35, Oncorhynchus mykiss5 and frog (Rana rugosa)36.On the contrary, a study in protogynous H. trimaculatus demonstrated that Foxl2 expression has no sexual dimorphism between the testis and ovary32. Foxl2 expression was also detected in testis of M. albus, though it was lower in the testis than that in the ovary. Thus, whether Foxl2 is a good marker of ovarian differentiation in sex reversal species or not should be deliberated.The highest levels of Foxl2 expression were observed in the ovary before sex reversal in M. albus. Foxl2 transcript decreased sharply when individuals developed to the intersex stage I (♀/♂I). Foxl2 expression also declined dramatically as the oocytes continued to degenerate, paralleling with the initiation of germ-cell proliferation into spermatogonia (♀/♂II and ♀/♂III). Then, Foxl2 expression was maintained at a low level in the testis. The correlation between the Foxl2 expression pattern and the process of sex development reveals the crucial function of Foxl2 during the sex reversal of M. albus. Foxl2 was highly expressed in brain and ovary during pre-spawning phase implying the important role for this correlate in ovarian recrudescence in catfish (Clarias gariepinus)37. As the same, high expression of Foxl2 was also observed in brain and ovary of M. albus, especially in fourth-stage ovaries (♀IV). This result suggests that Foxl2 is involved in the ovarian development and maturity. Foxl2 mRNA in the ovary is restricted to the granulosa (follicular) cells surrounding the oocytes in Oreochromis niloticus15 and O. latipes14. However, no signals have been observed in the oocytes, as the situation in mammals29,38. In this study, an immunohistochemical analysis showed that the Foxl2 protein was observed abundantly in the granulosa cells around the oocytes and immature oocytes, but not in the mature oocytes. This conserved expression patterns suggest that Foxl2 has a basic function in the differentiation of granulosa cells and a crucial role in the maintenance of oocytes. Lower levels of Foxl2 were detected in the developing testis of mouse from 14.5 dpc (day post conception) onward and in the developing epididymis at later stages by in situ hybridization12. In the hermaphrodite H. trimaculatus32, Foxl2 protein was concentrated in the interstitial cells, including in the tubules and Leydig cells of the testis. A small amount of Foxl2 mRNA was expressed in testis and its protein was also observed in the interstitial cells of the ovotestis and testis of M. albus. It is inferred that the function of Foxl2 in the testis of sex-reversal species could be quite different from other gonochorous teleost. Foxl2 might be also involved in the early development and maintenance of testis.It has been reported that Foxl2 regulates the expression of aromatase, the product of cyp19a1a39,40, which is the key enzyme in the synthesis of estrogen and important for sexual differentiation in fish17,41. Foxl2 in G. gallus is involved in the regulation of aromatase transcription during early sexual differentiation20,42. Foxl2 and aromatase in Oreochromis niloticus43 and O. latipes14 are co-expressed in some somatic cells located on the ventral side of the XX gonads. This data suggest the important role of Foxl2 in early ovarian differentiation by activating cyp19a1a transcription. Earlier studies of M. albus demonstrated that cyp19a1a was expressed specifically in the brain and gonads and then its expression declined significantly with the gonadal development22,44. In this study, M. albus Foxl2 was expressed in the brain and gonads. It was also co-expressed with cyp19a1a during gonadal development. Taken together, the correlation expression pattern between Foxl2 and cyp19a1a in ovary and brain indicates that Foxl2 may play an important role in ovarian development.In conclusion, Foxl2 expression in the gonads is in line with the process of sex development, revealing the important function of Foxl2 during the sex reversal of M. albus. Foxl2 protein and Foxl2 mRNA were detected in the ovaries, ovotestis and testis. Foxl2 was primarily located in granulosa cells, immature oocytes and interstitial cells. The Foxl2 mRNA was also observed in brain. These results illustrate that Foxl2 is involved in the early development and maintenance of both ovary and testis. In addition, the detection of Foxl2 expression in eyes suggests the possible function of Foxl2 in the development of ocular structures of M. albus.Wild M. albus were purchased from markets in Wuhan, China. The length of the individuals varied from 34 to 54 cm and their bodyweight ranged from 50 to 120 g. They were kept in fresh water for one week before processing. A small segment of the gonads was fixed in Holland–Bouin's fluid for histological assessment of the sexual status and immunohistochemical analysis. The remainder was frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80°C. All experiments were performed with the approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Huazhong Agricultural University (Wuhan, China), strictly according to the guidelines set by this committee for the treatment of animals. The experiments were also performed in accordance with the International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals, promulgated by the Society for the Study of Reproduction.The fixed gonads were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and then embedded in paraffin. Sections (5–8 μm thick) were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The sexual phase of each fish was confirmed by observation under a light microscope45.After the developmental phase of the gonads was determined following our previous study46, total RNA was extracted from the gonads (two samples were selected and RNA was extracted in each phase) and from the blood, muscle, skin, liver, eye (whole eye), spleen, intestines, kidney, heart and brain (whole brain), according to the RNAiso Plus manufacturer's recommendations (Takara, Dalian, China). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA in a 20 μL reaction volume following the manufacturer's recommendations of PrimeScript® RT Reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Perfect Real Time) (Takara).To clone Foxl2 (Foxl2a) from M. albus, a pair of degenerate primers was designed from the conserved regions of Foxl2 in other fish species. PCR was performed in a 25 μL reaction volume containing: 2 μL of ovarian cDNA as template, 0.5 μL of each 10 mM primer (see Table S1, supplementary file), 12.5 μL of Premix Taq DNA polymerase (Takara) and double-distilled water to a final volume of 25 μL. The 5′ and 3′ ends of the Foxl2 cDNA were obtained according to the manufacturer's instructions of the SMART RACE Kit (Clontech, USA). Four gene-specific primers (see Table S1, supplementary file) were designed for the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in 1% (w/v) agarose gel and purified using the TIANquick Midi Purification Kit (Tiangen, China). The purified product was recovered and cloned into the PMD-19T vector (Takara) and then sequenced at the Beijing Genomics Institute.Nucleotide sequences were identified with BLASTN at the NCBI web server. We deduced the amino-acid sequence using the BioEdit software and calculated the percentage identity with the MegAlign program. Clustal W was used to construct a multiple alignment of amino-acid sequences. The phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method in MEGA version 5.05. The credibility of each branch was supported by the bootstrap scores (1000 replicates). All of the sequences used in multiple alignment and phylogenetic analyses were obtained from GenBank.To identify the expression pattern of Foxl2 in various M. albus tissues, PCR amplification was performed with the gene-specific primers (see Table S1, supplementary file), which were designed based on the nucleotide sequence we cloned (see above). The PCR protocol was: preheating at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles at 95°C for 20 s, 60°C for 20 s and 72°C for 20 s, with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The mixture contained 2 μL of 10-fold-diluted cDNA in 25 μL PCR reaction volume (as described above). 18s rRNA (EU120033.1) was amplified with 18 PCR cycles as the internal control to calibrate the expression of Foxl2. All PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in 1% (w/v) agarose gel and the bands were visualized by staining with GelRed™.Absolute quantitative real-time RT–PCR experiments were performed in a final volume of 25 μL containing 2 μL of cDNA, 0.5 μL of each 10 mM primer and 12.5 μL of SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ II (Perfect Real Time, Takara). The protocol was: 30 s at 95°C, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 5 s, 60°C for 45 s and 72°C for 30 s. The samples were analyzed in triplicate and the fluorescence released from the dye which was monitored by Rotor-Gene Q. A negative control was containing each assay but cDNA. The standard curve was constructed by the serially diluted plasmid containing the target gene. The expression of Foxl2 in the samples was calculated from the standard curve and expressed as copies/ml. Differences of gene expressions in different developmental stages of the gonads were determined with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) following by Tukey's HSD test. The differences were deemed statistically significant at P < 0.05.An anti-Foxl2 polyclonal antibody (PA1-802, Thermo, USA) was used to determine the cellular localization of Foxl2 protein in the M. albus gonads. Sections were prepared as described above. After paraffin removal and dehydration, the sections were washed with citric acid buffer (0.1 M citric acid and sodium citrate, pH 6.0), incubated in 3% (v/v) H2O2 and 10% (v/v) normal goat serum to block nonspecific binding and then incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary antibody (diluted 1:100), which is a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues M(1)MASYPEPEDTAGT(14) of mouse FOXL2 and the host is rabbit. After incubation with the secondary antibody which is labeled by HRP (anti-mouse/rabbit, Maixin KIT-9901), the sections were exposed to 3′,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and stained with hematoxylin to visualize the nuclei in the gonadal tissues and then observed under a fluorescence microscope (Eclipse H600L, Nikon). As the negative control, the sections were treated in the same way but with Tris-buffered saline instead of the primary antibody.Cunningham, M. A., Zhu, Q., Unterman, T. G. & Hammond, J. M.

View our privacy policyAdvanced SearchSex determination can be robustly genetic, strongly environmental, or genetic subject to environmental perturbation. The genetic basis of sex determination is unknown for zebrafish (Danio rerio), a model for development and human health. We used RAD-tag population genomics to identify sex-linked polymorphisms. After verifying this “RAD-sex” method on medaka (Oryzias latipes), we studied two domesticated zebrafish strains (AB and TU), two natural laboratory strains (WIK and EKW), and two recent isolates from nature (NA and CB). All four natural strains had a single sex-linked region at the right tip of chromosome 4, enabling sex genotyping by PCR. Genotypes for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with the strongest statistical association to sex suggested that wild zebrafish have WZ/ZZ sex chromosomes. In natural strains, “male genotypes” became males and some “female genotypes” also became males, suggesting that the environment or genetic background can cause female-to-male sex reversal. Surprisingly, TU and AB lacked detectable sex-linked loci. Phylogenomics rooted on D. nigrofasciatus verified that all strains are monophyletic. Because AB and TU branched as a monophyletic clade, we could not rule out shared loss of the wild sex locus in a common ancestor despite their independent domestication. Mitochondrial DNA sequences showed that investigated strains represent only one of the three identified zebrafish haplogroups. Results suggest that zebrafish in nature possess a WZ/ZZ sex-determination mechanism with a major determinant lying near the right telomere of chromosome 4 that was modified during domestication. Strains providing the zebrafish reference genome lack key components of the natural sex-determination system but may have evolved variant sex-determining mechanisms during two decades in laboratory culture.…researchers using standard lines of zebrafish that have long been maintained in laboratories are often plagued by severe sex ratio distortions…. C. Lawrence, J. P. Ebersole, and R. V. Kesseli (2008)CONSIDERING the fundamental importance of sex for species propagation, it is surprising that primary sex-determining mechanisms are not strongly conserved among animal taxa (Bull 1983; Charlesworth 1996; Ming et al. 2011; Bachtrog et al. 2014). Closely related species or even populations of the same species can have different sex-determining mechanisms (Takehana et al. 2007; Ross et al. 2009; Kobayashi et al. 2013; Heule et al. 2014; Larney et al. 2014). Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a popular model for studies of vertebrate development, behavior, physiology, evolution, disease, and human health (Mills et al. 2007; Seth et al. 2013; Braasch et al. 2014; Ota and Kawahara 2014; Wilkinson et al. 2014), but researchers struggle with highly variable and distorted sex ratios, and investigations into the genetic nature of zebrafish sex determination are conflicting. To help understand these issues, we conducted a population genomic study of sex determination in multiple zebrafish strains.Zebrafish exhibit a juvenile ovary phase in which the gonad contains meiotic oocytes in all individuals: in some juveniles, oocytes survive and the individual becomes a female, but in others, oocytes die from about 19 to 27 days postfertilization and the fish becomes a male (Takahashi 1977; Uchida et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2007; Rodriguez-Mari et al. 2010). In the absence of germ cells (Slanchev et al. 2005; Siegfried and Nusslein-Volhard 2008) and in mutants in which oocytes undergo apoptosis (Rodríguez-Marí et al. 2005, 2010; Rodríguez-Marí and Postlethwait 2011), gonads develop as testes and individuals become males. Remarkably, mutants that produce oocytes early and reproduce as females can transform into fertile males after oocyte depletion, showing that oocytes are necessary both for primary sex determination and for maintenance of female phenotype in adult zebrafish (Dranow et al. 2013).As expected from the hypothesis that oocyte death is a major feature of zebrafish sex determination, harsh environmental conditions tend to shift sex ratios in favor of males; such factors include gamma rays, hypoxia, high density, high temperature, altered thermocycles, and poor nutrition (Walker-Durchanek 1980; Shang et al. 2006; Lawrence et al. 2008; Abozaid et al. 2011, 2012; Liew et al. 2012; Villamizar et al. 2012). Zebrafish does not, however, have a typical environmental sex-determination (ESD) mechanism like some sauropsids for which temperature is a cue (Charnier 1966; Lang and Andrews 1994; Merchant-Larios and Diaz-Hernandez 2013; Mork et al. 2014). It is more probable that zebrafish is like medaka (Oryzias latipes) in having a genetic sex-determination mechanism that is sensitive to environmental conditions (Hattori et al. 2007; Sato et al. 2005; Selim et al. 2009; Hayashi et al. 2010).Zebrafish not only lacks classic ESD, but most stocks investigated do not have cytogenetically detectable chromosomal sex determination (Schreeb et al. 1993; Pijnacker and Ferwerda 1995; Daga et al. 1996; Gornung et al. 1997; Amores and Postlethwait 1999; Gornung et al. 2000; Sola and Gornung 2001; Traut and Winking 2001; Phillips et al. 2006). In contrast, the only investigation of zebrafish taken directly from nature in India concluded that zebrafish females are the heterogametic sex (Sharma et al. 1998). The disagreement in cytogenetic results suggests that different zebrafish strains may have different karyotypic bases for sex determination.Not only is the chromosomal nature of zebrafish sex unresolved, but its genetic sex-determination (GSD) mechanism remains elusive. Repeated matings of zebrafish pairs from AB, TU (Tuebingen), and Toh strains produce consistent sex ratios, but different pairs can give quite different sex ratios (Liew et al. 2012). This result is expected if zebrafish has a genetic basis for sex determination with polygenic control that differs among strains (Liew et al. 2012). Furthermore, recent studies of sex genetics in different zebrafish strains identified sex-associated loci, confirming a genetic component to sex determination, but different studies identified different sex-associated loci (Orban et al. 2009; Siegfried 2010; Tong et al. 2010; Bradley et al. 2011; Anderson et al. 2012; Liew et al. 2012; Howe et al. 2013; Liew and Orban 2014). A cross between a female of the NA (Nadia) natural strain by a male of the AB laboratory strain identified a single sex-linked locus on zebrafish chromosome 4 (Chr4) while the reciprocal mating (female-AB-by-male-NA) showed sex-associated loci on both Chr4 and Chr3 (Anderson et al. 2012). In contrast, analysis of a female-AB-by-male-IN (India) cross identified sex-linked loci on Chr5 and Chr16 but none on Chr3 or Chr4 (Bradley et al. 2011). An F2 map constructed from a gynogenetic doubled-haploid TU female and a gynogenetic doubled-haploid AB male (i.e., both parents had only female-derived chromosomes) identified a sex-linked region on Chr16 that does not overlap with the one observed in the AB-by-IN mating (Bradley et al. 2011; Howe et al. 2013). Together, these results have been interpreted to support a polygenic sex-determination mechanism (Liew and Orban 2014), but they also support the hypothesis that different zebrafish strains utilize different genetic mechanisms to determine sex.Mapping crosses like those cited above that mate two zebrafish strains that differ in their major genetic sex-determining mechanisms might give difficult to interpret or even spurious results due to epistatic interactions between loci. Furthermore, because environmental factors can influence zebrafish sex ratios, an individual’s phenotypic sex may not match its genotypic sex. Thus, a traditional F2 mapping cross may not identify a major sex-determining locus if one of the P0 or F1 individuals is by chance sex reversed. In addition, brother-by-sister matings to make F2 families and gynogenesis protocols lead to inbreeding, which results in strongly male-biased sex ratios (Brown et al. 2012a).To help resolve the confusing state of zebrafish sex genetics, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) based on a population genomic analysis of RAD-tags (Baird et al. 2008) to identify SNPs found differentially in males or females (the “RAD-sex” method). This approach analyzes genotypes without regard to parentage and can identify loci of major effect (Atwell et al. 2010). To identify sex-specific SNPs in RAD-tags, we utilized Stacks, a program that infers genotypes from short-read sequences (Catchen et al. 2011, 2013). We investigated six zebrafish strains, including domesticated strains made lethal free for mutagenesis (AB and TU), natural strains cultured for a few years in the laboratory without deliberate genetic manipulations [EKW (EkkWill) and WIK (Wild India Kolkata)], and strains acquired directly from the wild in India [NA and CB (Cooch Behar)].Analysis of >25,000 SNPs in each of these six strains identified alleles differentially associated with sex phenotype. In all four natural strains, results identified a single sex-associated locus at the end of the long (right) arm of Chr4 (Chr4R), a locus previously identified as sar4 (sex-associated region Chr4) (Anderson et al. 2012). Results showed that the distribution of sar4 alleles in populations and their inheritance patterns in crosses were consistent with natural zebrafish populations having a WZ/ZZ sex-determination system, as previously suggested (Tong et al. 2010), and are in accord with the reported WZ/ZZ karyotype inferred for a zebrafish population taken directly from the wild (Sharma et al. 1998). Surprisingly, our experiments failed to detect any sex-linked loci in either AB or TU, two strains domesticated for mutagenesis experiments and sequenced for the zebrafish reference genome. Domestication led either to the evolution of new methods of sex determination during recent decades of selection by zebrafish researchers or to the unveiling of preexisting minor genetic sex-determining mechanisms.Zebrafish (D. rerio) were raised in the University of Oregon Zebrafish Research Facility under standard conditions (Westerfield 2007). Strains included the following:AB (ZFIN ID: ZDB-GENO-960809-7), originating from a mating of strain A and strain B purchased at two different times from a pet shop in Albany, Oregon, in the late 1970s and screened for making large numbers of lethal-free embryos by in vitro fertilization and subsequently bottlenecked through 21 gynogenetic half-tetrad individuals produced by early pressure treatment to establish the current AB strain (Walker-Durchanek 1980; Streisinger et al. 1981; Chakrabarti et al. 1983; C. Walker, personal communication)TU (Tuebingen, ZFIN ID: ZDB-GENO-990623-3), originating from a German pet store and selected to be lethal free ca. 1990 from multiple single pair crosses (Mullins et al. 1994)NA (Nadia, ZFIN ID: ZDB-GENO-030115-2, Anderson et al. 2012), the eighth generation of animals taken from nature in Nadia, India, in 2000WIK (Wild India Kolkata, ZFIN ID: ZDB-GENO-010531-2), which “derives from a wild catch in India” (Rauch et al. 1997), presumably Kolkata, about 140 km south of Nadia, originating from a single pair matingEKW (EkkWill, ZFIN ID: ZDB-GENO-990520-2), zebrafish of unknown origin maintained for many years in large populations at EkkWill Waterlife Resources (Ruskin, FL), which has supplied fish to the pet store trade since 1962 (http://www.ekkwill.com/aboutekkwill.html) and obtained from M. Carvan (University of Wisconsin—Milwaukee) (Loucks and Carvan 2004)CB (Cooch Behar), a new strain derived from fish collected in 2012 from Cooch Behar, India, ∼500 km north of Nadia, and purchased from Eugene Research Aquatics, LLC.Cooch Behar individuals taken directly from the wild gave small clutches and showed greatly reduced sex dimorphism. Dissection of CB fish taken directly from nature revealed 28 females, 4 hermaphrodites that contained both ovary and testis tissue, 1 fish with translucent tissue at the location expected for gonads, and 8 males (20% males), suggesting disrupted sex development by stress, endocrine-disrupting substances during development, or differential survival during acquisition of these animals. Supporting Information, Figure S4 shows the location of origin of the wild fish stocks discussed here.Group crosses of adults from each strain generated populations of fish from which we arbitrarily selected individuals for RAD-sex analysis. AB fish (UO stock no. S22191) came from stocks that the University of Oregon Zebrafish Research Facility maintains for shared use involving 10 crosses, each with 2 males and 2 females. Our TU population (S23232) came from in vitro fertilization of eggs from 4 females mixed with sperm pooled from 12 males. NA fish (S23847) derived from a natural cross of an unknown number males and females. WIK fish came from two different generations, one (S23069) a natural cross of 1 female by 2 males and the other (S24746) derived from multiple natural crosses. EKW fish were maintained in three tanks of 60 unsexed fish that were bred en masse by natural matings. CB individuals were from natural matings of the first generation offspring of 28 females and 8 males captured in India. The sex of each animal was determined by microscopic observation of dissected gonads. Individuals of undetermined sex were excluded from analysis.A population of dwarf danio (D. nigrofasciatus), a close relative of zebrafish (Mayden et al. 2007; Tang et al. 2010), was raised in the University of Oregon fish facility under standard zebrafish culture conditions (Westerfield 2007). A population of medaka (O. latipes) from the Carbio strain (WLC#2674) was raised at the University of Würzburg according to standard laboratory practices (http://shigen.lab.nig.ac.jp/medaka/medakabook/index.php)(Kirchen and West 1976). Male and female medaka were selected at random from the standing aquarium population, which is maintained by natural matings of ∼50 males and 50 females each generation. The phenotypic sex of medaka was first determined from secondary sex characteristics (shape of dorsal and anal fins, spines on male anal fin rays) and confirmed by macroscopic inspection of dissected gonads. The genotypic sex of medaka was identified from the presence or absence of the dmrt1bY gene by PCR from fin clip DNA essentially as described (Nanda et al. 2003) using allele-specific primers: DMT1k (5′ CAA CTT TGT CCA AAC TCT GA 3′) and DMT1l (5′ AAC TAA TTC ATC CCC ATT CC 3′) at an annealing temperature of 56°.Genomic DNA was isolated from caudal fin clips and muscle with a Qiagen DNeasy blood and tissue kit. DNA was digested with high-fidelity SbfI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs, no. R3642S). Barcode adapters five or six nucleotides long were ligated to each sample. Restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) libraries were prepared as described (Baird et al. 2008; Amores et al. 2011; Anderson et al. 2012) and were sequenced on an Illumina HiSequation 2000 or 2500 using 100-nucleotide single-end reads. We used Stacks software (http://creskolab.uoregon.edu/stacks/) to organize reads into loci and to identify polymorphisms (Catchen et al. 2011, 2013). We RAD-sequenced 20 males and 20 females from AB, 24 males and 24 females from TU, 25 males and 25 females from NA, 21 males and 37 females from EKW, 39 males and 28 females from WIK (of which 34 males and 27 females were retained for analysis), and 49 males and 28 females from CB. Illumina sequences were quality filtered with the process_radtags program of Stacks (Catchen et al. 2011) and then aligned to the zebrafish genome (v. Zv9)(Howe et al. 2013) using GSNAP (Wu and Nacu 2010), allowing nine mismatches. Medaka sequences were aligned to the O. latipes genome (v. MEDAKA1) (Kasahara et al. 2007). Sequences that aligned to multiple sites in reference genomes were discarded. Genotypes were called from aligned reads using the refmap.pl Stacks pipeline, requiring a minimum stack depth of 10 (−m 10). Reads that did not align to the genome were analyzed with the denovo_map.pl Stacks pipeline using the following parameters: a minimum stack depth of 10 (–m 10), up to three differences when merging stacks into loci (–M 3), and up to two differences between loci when building the catalog (–n 2).Zebrafish linkage group numbers assigned based on genetic length (Postlethwait et al. 1994; Johnson et al. 1996) are given the name “chromosome” in the Zv9 version of the zebrafish reference genome; here we abbreviate “linkage group” as Chr according to zebrafish nomenclature conventions (https://wiki.zfin.org/display/general/zfin+zebrafish+nomenclature+guidelines). Cytogeneticists numbered zebrafish chromosomes based on physical length (Pijnacker and Ferwerda 1995; Daga et al. 1996; Gornung et al. 1997, 2000; Amores and Postlethwait 1999; Sola and Gornung 2001), so zebrafish genetic linkage group number and cytogenetic chromosome number are generally not the same. We assigned genetic linkage groups to physical chromosomes by fluorescent in situ hybridization (Phillips et al. 2006), which showed that, for example, cytogenetic chromosome 3 is linkage group 4, called chromosome 4 in the reference genome and Chr4 in this work.Sequences for zebrafish, medaka, and dwarf danio RAD-tags were archived under accession no. SRP044635 and mitochondrial sequences under KM196113–KM196120.Haplotypes were exported from the Stacks web interface requiring a minimum stack depth of three reads, and a blacklist of overmerged tags was generated with a custom python script (File S1). The Stacks ref_map pipeline identifies RAD-tags based on position in the genome. Overmerged tags arise when different regions of the genome have highly similar sequences, so that genomically separate RAD-tags align to the same location, resulting in a stack of RAD-tags with a biologically impossible number of alleles. We defined overmerged tags as those that had more than two alleles in more than one fish, and excluded these tags from further analysis.Polymorphic RAD-tags were exported from Stacks in genomic format using Stacks’ populations program (Catchen et al. 2013). RAD-tags were required to be present in 75% of the individuals of each sex, and blacklisted tags were excluded. For each polymorphic SNP, the program SNPstats1 (http://webpages.uidaho.edu/hohenlohe/software.html) (Hohenlohe et al. 2010) calculated a G-test statistic comparing genotypes in males and females. False discovery rate (FDR) was calculated using the Qvalue R package (Storey and Tibshirani 2003) according to the method of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995). Markers that were significantly associated with sex after the first round of analysis were then inspected by hand. An arbitrarily selected subset of five individuals was evaluated in the Stacks web interface for all loci significantly associated with sex to ensure that Stacks had called genotypes correctly. If an error was identified in any of these five individuals, then all fish in the panel were checked at that locus and corrected by hand; for example, if three or more reads of an undersequenced allele were present in a stack, the genotype was corrected to a heterozygote in the genomic output file and statistics were recalculated.Four WIK males were excluded from analysis because they had numerous genotypes throughout the genome that were not present in the vast majority of other fish from the population, suggesting migrants. One male and one female WIK were excluded because they had numerous alleles that were undersequenced and uncalled by Stacks, likely due to barcode contamination.Despite the high quality of the zebrafish reference genome (Howe et al. 2013), many scaffolds remain unassembled, especially in areas rich in repeats, such as the heterochromatic and late-replicating right arm of zebrafish cytogenetic chromosome 3 (genetic linkage group 4, Ensembl Chr4) (Pijnacker and Ferwerda 1995; Daga et al. 1996; Amores and Postlethwait 1999; Traut and Winking 2001; Phillips et al. 2006; Anderson et al. 2012; Howe et al. 2013). Some RAD-tags that were strongly associated with sex reside on scaffolds that are either unassembled or are on Chr14 in Zv9. To test for misassembly, we used a previously published data set of SbfI-based RAD-tags mapped on the zebrafish HS (heat shock) meiotic recombination mapping panel (Kelly et al. 2000; Postlethwait et al. 2000; Woods et al. 2000, 2005; Catchen et al. 2011). Filtered raw reads from RAD-tagging the HS panel were aligned to the Zv9 assembly with GSNAP, allowing five mismatches. Because these gynogenetic fish were homozygous at all loci, we relaxed Stacks parameters and required a minimum stack depth of two reads (−m 2) to call genotypes. RAD-tags that aligned to Chr4 and Chr14 in the assembled genome and to all unassembled contigs and scaffolds were used to generate meiotic linkage maps for Chr4 and Chr14.Markers were initially grouped in JoinMap 4.1 using the Independence LOD parameter under population grouping with a minimum LOD value of 8.0. Subsequent grouping was performed at a minimum LOD value of 6.0. Marker ordering was performed using the maximum-likelihood algorithm in JoinMap 4.1 with default parameters. The expected recombination count feature in JoinMap4.1 was used to identify individuals with a higher than expected number of recombination events and visual inspection of marker order was performed. When needed, marker order was optimized manually after visual inspection of the colorized graphical genotypes in JoinMap 4.1. If moving a marker or group of markers reduced the total number of recombination events, the marker was manually moved to the new position. This analysis resulted in the positioning of many unplaced contigs and scaffolds across the entire Zv9 reference genome.A pair of primers (NA_sx.F_5-CCGGCCCTCAAGGACCGAAA-3 and NA_sx.R_5-GGTTGCTCAAGTGTTGGTGAGA-3) was designed within the sequence of a RAD-tag that aligned to Chr14:37,865,815–37,865,909 and included a sex-specific indel in the NA strain (see Figure S1). GoTaq Flexi DNA polymerase (Promega, M8298) was used to amplify the product with the following PCR protocol: denaturation at 94° for 6 min, 40 cycles of 94° denaturation, 55° annealing, and 72° extension followed by a final extension step of 72° for 10 min.To infer the history of zebrafish strains, we sampled RAD-tag sequences from 10 females and 10 males arbitrarily selected from each strain and identified 9,442 RAD-tag loci that were present in all 120 samples. To root the tree, we included orthologous RAD-tags from 1 male and 1 female D. nigrofasciatus for the 4,765 RAD-tags for which orthology could be inferred across species. RAD-tag loci were considered orthologous across strains and species if they mapped to the same unique location in the zebrafish reference genome Zv9. Tags with more than one best mapping location were excluded. We aligned sequences from each RAD-tag locus using Muscle (v. 3.8.31) with default parameters. Aligned loci were concatenated into a single 887.5-kb alignment. Using this alignment, we inferred phylogenetic trees and performed bootstrap replicates with RAxML (v. 7.2.8) using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood under a GTR+I+Γ model with D. nigrofasciatus as the outgroup (Stamatakis 2014).For zebrafish strains, we assembled sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene from Illumina reads arising from small amounts of contaminating mitochondrial DNA. All reads used for RAD-tag analysis in Stacks have 6 bases left by the SbfI enzyme digestion (TGCAGG); reads without this sequence are from contaminating nuclear or mitochondrial genomic DNA. Reads with a correct barcode, but lacking a TGCAGG motif were identified with the process_radtags program from Stacks (Catchen et al. 2011) and aligned to the zebrafish genome using GSNAP (February 20, 2014, release) (Wu and Nacu 2010).To verify that a RAD-tag-based population genomics approach would identify a major sex-determination locus if one exists, we first tested a species in which the sex chromosome and major sex-determination locus has already been identified. Although Japanese medaka has a strong XY sex-determination system based on the sex-determining gene dmrt1bY located on chromosome Ola1 (O. latipes chromosome 1) (Matsuda et al. 2002; Nanda et al. 2002; Kondo et al. 2006, 2009), environmental temperature can override the system and cause genotypic females to develop as phenotypic males (Sato et al. 2005; Hattori et al. 2007; Selim et al. 2009; Hayashi et al. 2010). We analyzed 21,909 RAD-tags (Table 1) from 30 female and 31 male medaka and conducted a G-test for genotypes that are significantly associated with male or female sex at 36,115 SNPs. Although the medaka Y chromosome is fully assembled, including dmrt1bY in the middle of Ola1 (NCBI accession nos. AP006150–AP006153 (Kondo et al. 2006)), the male-specific region is not assembled well in the reference genome sequence (http://www.ensembl.org/Oryzias_latipes/Info/Index) and dmrt1bY itself is on the unassembled scaffold1535, which contains no SbfI site and hence no RAD-tags, thus excluding dmrt1bY from our analyses. Nevertheless, results revealed SNPs between 14.3 and 32.5 Mb on Ola1 that were strongly associated with sex (Figure 1A; see Table S1). Only six sex-linked RAD-tags failed to align to the reference genome, none of which were as strongly associated with sex as the best hits within the genome (Table S2). In the medaka reference genome, a region of 18.2 Mb around the position of the sex-determining locus dmrt1bY contained polymorphisms that are highly associated with sex, and 3.5 Mb of this region showed 100% correlation with the genotypic sex that had been determined previously by PCR, consistent with recombination suppression over the region showing strongly sex-specific RAD-tags. PCR genotyping and RAD-sex analysis both agreed that 2 of 31 medaka individuals with a male phenotype had a female genotype, showing that despite occasional sex reversal, the RAD-sex method is robust enough to identify sex-linked markers. Sex-linked SNPs were also identified in single RAD-tags on Ola3, Ola13, and Ola17. These SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium with the sex-linked SNPs on Ola1 (Figure 1, B and C), a result expected if these parts of Ola3, Ola13, and Ola17 were misassembled in the medaka reference genome. These experiments show that a RAD-tag-based GWAS study is an effective method for identifying a major sex-determining region despite occasional sex reversal.RAD-sex for the medaka (O. latipes) assembled genome sequence. (A) The -log10P of a G-test of genotypes associated with male or female phenotype plotted against position in the 24 medaka linkage groups, with odd-numbered linkage groups having a white background and even-numbered linkage groups having a gray background. The solid horizontal line represents a q-value of 0.01, and the dashed line represents a q-value of 0.05. The analysis identified a broad peak of sex-associated SNPs on chromosome 1, (Ola1) the medaka sex chromosome. Isolated single SNPs on chromosomes 3, 13, and 17 were also highly linked to sex. (B) Medaka females were homozygous at SNPs strongly linked to sex, as expected from an XX karyotype, on Ola1 (only two of which are shown), and Ola3, Ola13, and Ola17. (C) Most medaka males were heterozygous at SNPs strongly linked to sex, as expected from an XY sex-determination system. Phenotypic males M1 and M4 had a female genotype. SNPs on Ola3, Ola13, and Ola17 were in linkage disequilibrium with sex-linked SNPs on Ola1, a result that would occur if these regions are on Ola1 in the fish genome but have been misassembled in the medaka reference genome sequence.To identify loci linked to sex phenotype in zebrafish, we initially analyzed SbfI-associated RAD-tags (Table 1) from the widely used AB and TU strains. We tested 20 males and 20 females of the AB strain and 24 males and 24 females of the TU strain and compared results to 25 males and 25 females from NA, a natural strain from India. We analyzed 31,002 SNPs in AB and 40,391 SNPs in TU but found no markers that were significantly linked to sex (Figure 2, A and B). In contrast, analysis of 26,291 SNPs in NA fish revealed several sharp peaks of association with phenotypic sex. Sex-linked SNPs in NA were located at the right end of Chr4 between position 61.1 and 62.1 Mb, in the middle of Chr14 between 37.87 and 37.90 Mb, and on the “Not Assembled” contigs NA482 and NA683 (Figure 2C and Table S3).RAD-sex results for zebrafish strains show plots of the −log10P of a G-test of genotypes associated with male or female phenotype in zebrafish plotted against the 25 linkage groups of the assembled zebrafish genome Zv9, with odd-numbered linkage groups having a white background and even-numbered linkage groups having a gray background. Solid lines represent a q-value of 0.01, and dashed lines represent a q-value of 0.05. No SNPs were significantly associated with sex in (A) AB or (B) Tuebingen strains. In contrast SNPs significantly associated with sex were identified on Chr4 and Chr14 in (C) Nadia and (D) WIK, while only loci on Chr4 were associated with sex in (E) EkkWill and (F) Cooch Behar. In addition to the assembled genome, sex-associated SNPs appeared on unassembled contigs NA482 and NA683 for WIK and NA, NA851 for WIK and EKW, scaffold3519 for WIK, EKW, and CB, and scaffold3545 for WIK.Puzzled by the differences between AB and TU fish vs. NA fish, we analyzed two additional commonly used wild-type strains: WIK and EKW. We analyzed 39,256 polymorphic sites in 34 male and 27 female WIK fish and identified sex-associated SNPs located between 61.4 and 62.1 Mb at the end of Chr4, between 37.87 and 37.90 Mb on Chr14, and on the unassembled contigs NA482 and NA683 as found for the NA strain; in addition, sex-associated SNPs for WIK appeared on contig NA851, scaffold3519, and scaffold3545 (Figure 2D and Table S3). Analysis of 49,182 SNPs in 21 male and 37 female EKW fish again identified sex-associated SNPs on Chr4 between 61.1 and 61.2 Mb, and the unassembled fragments NA851 and scaffold3519, both of which were also identified in the WIK RAD-sex results (Figure 2E and Table S3). No locus on Chr14 was associated with sex in EKW.To verify the discrepancy between domesticated and natural stocks, we obtained zebrafish directly from a natural population in Cooch Behar in India. We bred wild-caught individuals in the lab to establish the CB strain and used some of the offspring of wild-caught individuals for RAD-sex analysis. We analyzed 94,497 polymorphic sites in 49 males and 28 females (this strain showed much higher levels of heterozygosity than any of the other stocks examined; Figure S2) and identified sex-linked SNPs on Chr4:60.6 Mb and on scaffold3519, which was also found to harbor sex-linked SNPs in WIK (Figure 2F and Table S3).DNA for the zebrafish reference genome sequence initially came from several thousand TU embryos (Howe et al. 2013), some of which would have become males and others females, despite our finding that TU had no loci strongly linked to sex phenotype. If the reference genome lacked one of the sex chromosomes, then many sex-linked RAD-tags from wild stocks would fail to align to it. Analysis, however, showed that only one sex-linked RAD-tag in NA, one in EKW, and four in WIK failed to align to the zebrafish reference genome (Table S4). SNPs in all nonaligning sex-linked RAD-tags were less strongly associated with sex than those that actually aligned to assembled or unassembled portions of the Zv9 reference genome. This result suggests that the assembly does not lack substantial amounts of any sex chromosome or that the major sex determinant is in a genomic region or unassembled contig with no SbfI sites, as is true for medaka.While all four natural populations we studied had a strong sex-associated region near the right telomere of Chr4, several strains showed sex-associated loci at other locations, including a small portion of Chr14 and a number of unassembled contigs and scaffolds (Table S5). Suspecting that the Chr14 locus and unassembled contigs and scaffolds belong on Chr4R, we utilized a previously published data set of RAD-tags generated from the zebrafish HS meiotic mapping panel (Kelly et al. 2000; Postlethwait et al. 2000; Woods et al. 2000; Woods et al. 2005; Catchen et al. 2011) to identify the position of these loci on a genetic map and hence to correct possible misassembly of these regions in Zv9. Results showed that nonassembled contigs NA683 and NA851 and scaffold3519, which are linked to sex in multiple natural populations (Table S5), all localized to the end of Chr4 near other sex-linked tags in the meiotic mapping panel (Figure 3). Sex-associated fragments NA482 and scaffold3545 lacked any RAD-tags that were polymorphic in the meiotic mapping panel and so could not be mapped. Two sex-associated RAD-tags that had aligned to Chr14 at positions Chr14:37,844,151 and Chr14:37,879,718 also mapped to Chr4R near other sex-linked RAD-tag polymorphisms. The finding that all mappable sex-linked RAD-tags in four natural strains (NA, WIK, EKW, and CB) occupy a single 1.5-Mb region at the right tip of Chr4 supports the conclusion that Chr4 represents a sex chromosome in natural populations of zebrafish. The failure to detect any sex-linked loci in AB and TU in these analyses suggests that a wild sex determinant was lost or greatly modified in the domestication of zebrafish for laboratory work and that other mechanisms have since taken the place of the natural wild genetic sex-determination system.All sex-associated RAD-tags map to Chr4. Sex-associated SNPs were mapped on the HS meiotic mapping cross panel (Kelly et al. 2000; Postlethwait et al. 2000; Woods et al. 2000; Catchen et al. 2013). The sar4 region is indicated by shading. RAD-tags that aligned to Chr14 at 37.8 Mb and to the unassembled scaffolds NA683, NA851, scaffold3519, scaffold3462, and scaffold3536 (indicated in boldface italic type) all mapped to the distal tip of Chr4R on the HS panel.To determine whether natural zebrafish utilize an XY or ZW sex-determination system, we scrutinized the SNP with the strongest statistical support for linkage to sex phenotype in each of the four natural populations. In NA, the SNP most strongly associated with sex was an A > T (nucleotide A in the reference genome vs. T in NA) polymorphism on the unassembled contig NA683 at nucleotide position 12,119 with support of −log10P = 6.8. All 15 fish with the homozygous T/T genotype were males, while 77% (23/30) of A/T heterozygotes developed as females. No individual developed as a female that did not have at least one A allele at this SNP. Only one individual was homozygous A/A, and it, rather surprisingly, developed as a male (Figure 4A). An A/A male could result from sex reversal or from recombination events that separated the sex-linked RAD-tag locus from the causative sex-determination locus. The rather small size of the zebrafish sex-associated region, about 1.5 Mb (60.6–62.1 Mb when considering all four natural strains and including all SNPs with a q-value <0.01) compared to the large region we detected in medaka (14.3–32.5 Mb, or 18.2 Mb using the same q-value) suggests that recombination suppression is stronger around the medaka sex locus than around the zebrafish sex locus.Genotypes for SNPs linked to sex phenotype with the highest statistical significance for four natural populations of zebrafish. (A) Nadia SNP at NA683:12,119 (nonassembled contig:nucleotide position), A > T, −log10P = 6.8. All T/T fish were male; 77% of A/T fish were female; the only A/A fish was male. (B) WIK SNP Chr4:62,060,103, A > C, −log10P = 5.4. All C/C fish were male; 64% of A/C and 60% of A/A fish were females. (C) EkkWill SNP at scaffold3519:177,330, A > T, −log10P = 12.5. All A/A fish were male; 94% of A/T and all T/T fish were females. (D) Cooch Behar SNP Chr4:60,623,846, C > T, −log10P = 8.5. All T/T fish were male; 52% of T/C and all seven C/C fish became female. In each of the four populations, all individuals homozygous for the “male allele” (T in NA, C in WIK, A in EKW, and T in CB) developed as males, heterozygotes (A/T in NA, C/A in WIK, T/A in EKW, and C/T in CB) developed mostly as females, and homozygotes for the “female” allele (A in NA, A in WIK, T in EKW, and C in CB) were rare and usually female. In each strain, fish with the homozygous “male allele” all became males and no individuals without the “non-male allele” (the “female allele”) developed into a female. Individuals homozygous for the “female allele” were obtained much less frequently than expected from random mating, which would be expected either if there were few matings between a male and a female both of which had at least one “female” allele or if homozygotes for the “female allele” were less likely to survive. These patterns would be expected of a WZ female/ZZ male sex-determination system with some female genotypes sex reversing to become males. (E) Analysis of the AB × NA F2 sex mapping cross (Anderson et al. 2012). RAD tag 32204, for example, which aligns to Chr4:61,934,186–61,934,280, has allele d that is present in the granddam, the F1 female, and all F2 females as expected if it resides on the W of a WZ/ZZ sex-determination system. (F) Sex-genotyping primers for NA. In the NA strain, the “female allele” in RAD-tag 4086 (which aligned to Chr14:37,865,815–37,865,909 in Zv9 but mapped to the right tip of Chr4 on the HS meiotic mapping panel, Figure 3) has a 12-nt deletion relative to the reference sequence. Primers with the sequence of the female allele in this RAD-tag gave an 85-bp fragment in females but produced an alternative amplification pattern in males. Sex-reversed individuals (as determined by this and other sex-linked RAD-tags) are indicated with an R.These data for NA show that: (1) the A allele of this SNP in NA is linked to a dominant factor that is necessary but not sufficient for development of a female phenotype; (2) the NA strain has a heterozygous female/homozygous male (e.g., ZW female/ZZ male) sex-determination system; (3) some A/T and A/A “genetic females” are sex reversed to a male phenotype due to the effects of the environment or to segregating minor genetic modifiers that our protocol could not detect; and (4) the small number of individuals with an A/A genotype could be due to the infrequent mating of a normal heterozygous A/T genotypic female to a sex-reversed heterozygous genotypic A/T male, that the homozygous A genotype is semilethal, or that these genotypes come from a recombination event between the RAD-tag and the functional sex locus.This pattern was repeated in the other natural populations. In WIK, an A > C polymorphism at Chr4:62,060,103 showed the strongest statistical support for sex linkage (−log10P = 5.4). All 16 homozygous C/C WIK fish were male, but 64% (18/28) of A/C heterozygotes and 60% (9/15) of A/A homozygotes were females (Figure 4B). In EKW, an A > T polymorphism at scaffold3519:177,330 was statistically most strongly linked to sex (−log10P = 12.5). All 18 A/A homozygotes developed as males, while 94% (32/34) of A/T heterozygotes and all four T/T homozygotes became females (Figure 4C). In CB, a C > T polymorphism at Chr4:60,623,846 was statistically most strongly linked to sex (−log10P = 8.5). All 24 homozygous T/T fish were male, while 52% (17/33) of heterozygous T/C individuals and all seven homozygous C/C fish were female (Figure 4D). While the CB result could be interpreted as supporting a balancing sex-determination system, with T/T fish developing as males, C/C fish developing as females, and heterozygotes developing as either sex, a more parsimonious explanation that mirrors other native strains is that the C allele is linked to a locus that is necessary but not sufficient for female sex development and that homozygous C/C fish come from the mating of a normal T/C female to a sex-reversed phenotypic T/C male. Taken together, data from all four wild stocks provide strong support for a female-heterogametic sex-determination system.Reanalysis of a female-NA-by-male-AB F2 mapping panel (Anderson et al. 2012) supports female heterogamety. For RAD-tag 32204 (Anderson et al. 2012), all 78 F2 individuals that inherited the grandsire’s a allele became males, but a is not a male-specifying allele because it was inherited through the F1 female. The grandsire’s b allele and the granddam’s c allele were about equally likely to be found in males and females in the F2 (52 and 58% males, respectively), so they are unrelated to sex differentiation. In contrast, 84% (74/88) of F2 fish with the granddam’s d allele, inherited through the F1 female, themselves became females and no fish without the d allele became a female (Figure 4E). These results show that a sequence linked to the d allele is necessary but not sufficient for female development in this female-NA-by-male-AB cross, independent of the other allele, consistent with a dominant, environmentally sensitive, female-determining locus at sar4 and female heterogamety.One of the RAD-tags (4086) that was tightly linked to sex in NA (−log10P = 6.0) contained a 12-bp indel with the insertion present in the female-linked allele. Although this RAD-tag aligned uniquely to Chr14:37,865,815–37,865,909 in Zv9, it mapped to the right tip of Chr4 on the HS meiotic mapping panel (Figure 3). Within the RAD-tag, we designed a forward primer containing four female-specific SNPs and a reverse primer with one female-specific SNP that amplify a single 85-bp band in NA females and a 73-bp band or a nonspecific banding pattern in NA males (Figure 4F). We tested all 50 individuals from our NA population genomic analyses, of which Stacks had genotyped 24 phenotypic females and 22 phenotypic males at this locus. PCR verified the genetic sex determined by RAD-tag analysis for all individuals, including those experiencing female-to-male sex reversal. These primers also accurately identified the sex of individuals that Stacks did not genotype at this locus (due to insufficient read depth) but were genotyped for sex at nearby SNPs.After verifying primers on the RAD-sex population, we tested other NA fish. Of eight phenotypic females tested, all had the female genotype and of eight phenotypic males tested, seven had the male genotype; the other phenotypic male had a female genotype, consistent with occasional female-to-male sex reversal observed in other natural stocks. These results show that this primer pair can identify NA fish that will definitely become males or that have a high probability of becoming females. These sex-genotyping primers will be useful for identifying genetic sex long before phenotypic sex becomes evident, which will facilitate the study of developmental mechanisms.To determine whether our four natural strains represent separate accessions from the wild and to understand their historical relationships to the two strains that lack the Chr4R sex determinant, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis using RAD-sex sequence data. We collected RAD-tag genomic data from dwarf danio (D. nigrofasciatus), one of the closest extant relatives of zebrafish, for use as outgroup (Mayden et al. 2007; Tang et al. 2010). Because D. nigrofasciatus is native to the Sittang basin in Myanmar, which is far outside the range of D. rerio (Figure S4), the two species are not sympatric (Engeszer et al. 2007; Whiteley et al. 2011). Analysis utilized 888 kb of sequence from 9442 RAD-tags present in all six D. rerio strains, including 58,282 variable positions of which 51,444 SNPs were parsimony informative.Analysis of the maximum-likelihood tree (Figure 5) and the maximum-parsimony tree (see Figure S3) provided several conclusions:Maximum-likelihood phylogeny of six D. rerio strains. The phenotypic sex of each individual is abbreviated as F (female) or M (male). Branch labels reflect bootstrap support. Each zebrafish strain represents a distinct clade.Maximum-likelihood and maximum-parsimony both gave strong support for the same phylogenetic relationships among strains. In contrast, relationships between individuals within a strain varied between the two approaches and across maximum-likelihood bootstrap replicates.Analyses consistently recovered the same relationships among the three terminal taxa [EKW (AB,TU)] across bootstrap replicates under a GTR+I+Γ model. Because AB and TU occupied a monophyletic clade that was sister to EKW, phylogenomics does not resolve the question of whether the lack of the Chr4R sex-determination locus in AB and TU is due to two independent events during their separate and independent routes to domestication in Oregon and Germany or to a single event that occurred either in nature or in the pet trade before the divergence of these two populations.Recent extractions from East India (NA, WIK, CB) were genetically distinct from the [EKW (AB,TU))]clade, although relationships among NA, WIK, and CB varied across bootstrap replicates, as evidenced by poor support of the respective internal nodes (41 and 43%, Figure 5). The inability to resolve relationships among these strains even with a large amount of available sequence data are due to variation in the placement of the root of the tree. The length of the branch between zebrafish and dwarf danio is orders of magnitude longer than the length of the internal nodes separating strains because dwarf danio lacks zebrafish-specific RAD-tags. Unfortunately, outgroups closer to zebrafish are as yet unknown.CB appears to have two subclades, suggesting population substructure within that isolate. In addition, CB harbors more genetic variation than the other strains as evidenced by the depth of the root of that strain and analysis of heterozygosity (Figure 5 and Figure S2). This result is expected for the offspring of individuals taken directly from nature.Males and females do not group separately within strains, showing that standing genetic variation in the bulk of the genome masks any sex-specific differences in the phylogenetic analyses. In sum, phylogenomics showed that each of the six strains used is a distinct population, that the most recently accessed natural strains lie basal in the tree, and that the domesticated strains AB and TU are rather closely related among the strains we tested.To determine whether our strains cover the broad diversity of zebrafish natural variation, we investigated cytb, encoded by the mitochondrial genome. Zebrafish populations collected widely across India fall into three major clades: haplogroup 1 in Northern India and Eastern and Western Nepal, haplogroup 2 in Bangladesh and Southern India, and haplogroup 3 in Central Nepal (Whiteley et al. 2011). Infrequent mitochondrial genome contamination in RAD-tag libraries allowed us to reconstruct the cytb locus and assign populations to mitochondrial clades (accession nos. KM196113–KM196120). Results (see Figure S5) identified 14 SNPs that were shared across all our strains and all fish of haplogroup 1 but were absent from all haplogroups 2 and 3, showing that NA, WIK, EKW, and CB all derived from haplogroup 1 (Whiteley et al. 2011). Among the six strains we used and the 16 populations in the Whiteley et al. (2011) study, only AB appeared in both studies, and in both cases was in haplogroup 1. We conclude that our samples represent a single branch of the broad diversity of mitochondrial lineages across the zebrafish species.RAD-sex analysis identified a 1.5-Mb interval containing a major genetic sex determinant near the telomere of zebrafish Chr4R in two natural laboratory strains (WIK and EKW) and in two recent accessions from the wild (NA and CB). These four natural strains have not been extensively manipulated for domestication and were derived from natural populations in India (NA, WIK, and CB) or are of unknown, but likely unmanipulated, origin (EKW). Results also detected sex-linked loci within a small portion of Chr14 and on several unassembled contigs and scaffolds, as might be expected if zebrafish sex phenotype is polygenic (Tong et al. 2010; Bradley et al. 2011; Anderson et al. 2012; Liew et al. 2012; Howe et al. 2013; Liew and Orban 2014). To determine whether these several sex-linked sequences represented a polygenic sex-determination system or whether they were due to errors in the genome assembly, we mapped the unassembled and Chr14 sex-linked loci on a meiotic mapping panel. Because results showed that all sex-linked sequences map to the right tip of Chr4 in Zv9, we conclude that natural wild zebrafish have a single major sex-determining region within a short segment of Chr4R, sar4.The discovery of a strongly sex-linked locus only in Chr4R in natural zebrafish raises the question of whether Chr4 is a sex chromosome. Genetically defined Chr4 (Postlethwait et al. 1994; Johnson et al. 1996) corresponds to cytogenetic chromosome 3 (Phillips et al. 2006), the right arm of which is the only arm that is late replicating and heterochromatic (Pijnacker and Ferwerda 1995; Gornung et al. 1997; Amores and Postlethwait 1999; Gornung et al. 2000; Sola and Gornung 2001; Traut and Winking 2001; Phillips et al. 2006). Chr4R is impoverished in protein-coding genes, contains most of the genome’s 5S–RNA genes, is enriched in satellite repeats, and has high GC content (Anderson et al. 2012; Howe et al. 2013); these properties are shared with sex chromosomes in other species (Peichel et al. 2004; Charlesworth et al. 2005). Finding sex-linked markers only on the sole chromosome arm with cytogenetic properties of sex chromosomes is consistent with the hypothesis that Chr4 is a sex chromosome in zebrafish.The conclusion that Chr4 is a sex chromosome raises the question of whether zebrafish has a female-XX/male-XY, a female-WZ/male-ZZ, or other type of chromosomal sex mechanism. Our population genomics and meiotic mapping both support the conclusion from testosterone-treated AB × WIK individuals (Tong et al. 2010) that females are the heterogametic sex (WZ) in natural populations of zebrafish. For the SNP that is statistically associated most strongly to sex phenotype in each natural population: (1) all individuals that were homozygous for one allele (e.g., m/m), which could be on the Z chromosome, developed as males; (2) most individuals that were heterozygous (e.g., m/f), which could represent a WZ karyotype, became females; and (3) fish that were homozygous for the allele that is not homozygous in most males (e.g., f/f fish, presumably WW) usually developed as females and were fewer than expected by random mating and equal viability. These fish would occur from the mating of a genetic (WZ) female with a, sex-reversed (WZ) phenotypic male. And (4) although some fish with a female genotype (f/m) developed as males, no individual with a male genotype (m/m) became a female. This result suggests that (5), an allele (f) is necessary but not sufficient to make a female phenotype, or the Z version of the native Chr4 has a dosage-sensitive locus for which two doses guarantees male development and one dose favors, but does not assure, female development.The dominant-female-allele hypothesis and the two-dose-male–one-dose-female hypothesis have both been described in vertebrates. A W-linked, dominantly acting truncated copy of DMRT1 triggers ovary development in the frog Xenopus laevis, likely acting as a dominant-negative inhibitor of the normal DMRT1 gene (Yoshimoto et al. 2008; Yoshimoto et al. 2010; Yoshimoto and Ito 2011). DMRT1 is also involved in sex determination in birds, but the agent is a Z-linked copy that affects sex development by a dosage-sensitive mechanism (Smith et al. 2009). The Z, but not the W, in half-smooth tongue sole has a functional copy of dmrt1, consistent with the dosage-sensitive hypothesis (Chen et al. 2014). A variant of dmrt1 is also the major Y-linked sex determinant of Japanese medaka O. latipes (Matsuda et al. 2002; Nanda et al. 2002; Kondo et al. 2006, 2009). In some species of Oryzias, variants of different genes in the sex-determination pathway, including gsdf and sox3,are at the top of the sex-determination hierarchy (Takehana et al. 2007, 2014; Kondo et al. 2009; Myosho et al. 2012; Kikuchi and Hamaguchi 2013), while in other species of fish, other genes are at the top of the hierarchy, including a variant of irf9 in trout and amhr in fugu (Kamiya et al. 2012; Yano et al. 2012). The molecular genetic nature of the zebrafish sex determinant is as yet unknown. About 80% of Chr4R genes have no apparent human ortholog and are highly duplicated, with, for example, 109 genes encoding NOD-like receptors and zinc finger proteins (Howe et al. 2013), and as discussed below, the strains from which the Zv9 zebrafish reference genome was derived lack or have a greatly modified Chr4-linked sex-determination system, making it likely that the reference genome does not contain the normal wild sex determinant.The only karyotypes known to involve zebrafish collected directly from nature (Mansar Lake, Jammu) tentatively support the WW/WZ chromosomal sex system (Sharma et al. 1998). The relevance of the Mansar Lake fish to our populations, however, is unknown. Mansar Lake is 2000 km west of Nadia, Kolkata, and Cooch Behar and the phylogenetic relationship of its zebrafish to our populations is unknown. Furthermore, the Z chromosome in Mansar Lake fish was cytogenetically much larger than the W chromosome (Sharma et al. 1998). Assuming that SbfI sites are distributed with approximately the same density across Z and W chromosomes, a large proportion of sex-linked RAD-tags should be homozygous in ZZ males and heterozygous in WZ females. In our experiments, however, only a small fraction of Chr4-linked RAD-tags fit these criteria, suggesting that our Indian populations, while maintaining a WZ/ZZ system, might have a different sex chromosome karyotype than the one suggested by published analyses of the Mansar Lake population.In contrast to natural strains, RAD-sex failed to detect any sex-linked loci in AB and TU, which is surprising given that published studies involving these strains identified sex-biasing loci. For the SATmap study, we made fully homozygous (doubled haploid) gynogenetic AB and TU fish, some of which became males and others females despite all fish having only female-derived chromosomes (Howe et al. 2013). Crossing a fully homozygous female TU fish to a fully homozygous male AB fish produced a clutch of genetically identical F1 heterozygotes, some of which became males and others females (Howe et al. 2013), showing that genetic differences are not essential for zebrafish sex determination. Apparently, in the absence of genetic differences, other forces influence zebrafish sex determination; for example, stochastic differences might cause some eggs to have less yolk than others or environmental differences might arise if late hatching larvae have less access to food; both situations would lead to poorer nutrition, slower growth, and a greater likelihood of developing as a male (Lawrence et al. 2008).To produce the F2 SATmap population, a heterozygous AB/TU F1 male was crossed to his genetically identical sister (Howe et al. 2013). Analysis identified a single significant peak linked to sex at Chr16:19 Mb–23 Mb. Homozygotes for the granddam (TU) allele were 70% likely to become female but homozygotes for the grandsire (AB) allele were only 26% likely to become female, while heterozygotes were about equally likely to be male or female (Howe et al. 2013). This result shows that a locus on Chr16 has female-favoring allele(s) in TU and/or male-favoring alleles in AB. This result does not address the question of whether sex-determination alleles are polymorphic within each strain, just that alleles differ between strains. For example, AB fish might have partially deleterious alleles at this locus so that AB homozygotes have fewer primordial germ cells, are slower developing, or are less successful at obtaining nutrition and thus more likely to become males relative to individuals homozygous for TU alleles (Lawrence et al. 2008; Siegfried and Nusslein-Volhard 2008; Rodriguez-Mari et al. 2010; Rodríguez-Marí and Postlethwait 2011; Dranow et al. 2013). In contrast, RAD-sex detects sex-linked polymorphisms segregating within a strain, not between strains. If the Chr16 sex-biasing factor that varies between AB and TU is not polymorphic within AB or within TU, our protocol would not find it. Furthermore, the failure to find sar4 in the SATmap experiments supports our finding that AB and TU lack sar4.AB and TU both experienced selection to remove preexisting mutations for mutagenesis experiments (Walker-Durchanek 1980; Streisinger et al. 1981; Mullins et al. 1994). C. Walker produced AB from 21 females derived by half-tetrad gynogenesis (Streisinger et al. 1981), which produces offspring that are homozygous except for regions distal to a recombination event; thus, half-tetrad gynogenesis might or might not eliminate heterozygosity at the distally located sar4 locus. Because homozygosity can result in male bias due to loss of fitness (Brown et al. 2012a,b), some half-tetrad animals might sex reverse to male development despite heterozygosity at sar4. The mating of a WW (or ZZ) gynogenetic female (or male) to a sex-reversed WW (or ZZ) gynogenetic male (or female) might result in the loss of the Z (or W) chromosome making a homozygous WW (or ZZ) strain. Sex-biasing alleles or environmental factors could cause some WW (or ZZ) individuals to become males (or females), allowing the strain to propagate. Researchers might select for any preexisting male- or female-biasing alleles as they set up mating pairs; eventually a new genetic sex-determining mechanism might evolve in the domesticated strain, perhaps similar to the rapid evolution of new sex chromosomes in cichlids (Roberts et al. 2009; Ser et al. 2010; Parnell and Streelman 2013).TU originated from a pet store in Germany about 1990. Mullins et al. (1994) used multiple single-pair matings to make a lethal-free strain without gynogenesis and with a conscious effort to maintain genetic variation. A hypothesis is that the major wild male or female sex determinant was linked to lethal or deleterious alleles, leading to the loss of the sex determinant along with lethal allele loss. In the absence of male or female alleles of the major sex determinant, occasional sex reversal would allow for stock maintenance, and researchers would strongly select for alleles favoring the development of both sexes. If this hypothesis were true, then the evolution of new sex determinants in TU provides a unique opportunity to study the evolution of new sex-determining mechanisms.Despite the absence of a strong sex-linked locus on Chr4, AB and TU may have retained some components of the wild sex-determination mechanism:A female-AB-by-male-IN cross (MGH cross) identified sex-linked loci at Chr5:44.5–46.6 Mb and Chr16:13–17 Mb that together account for just 16% of the variance with regard to sex (Knapik et al. 1996, 1998; Bradley et al. 2011). If the AB parental female lacked a strong female sex determinant as in our AB fish, then the MGH cross might miss sar4 even if IN females, which were not involved in the cross, do possess the natural wild sex determinant.Our female-AB-by-male-NA cross identified sex-linked loci in addition to sar4, specifically, one on Chr3, although the reciprocal cross identified only sar4 (Anderson et al. 2012).As discussed above, the female-TU-by-male-AB SATmap cross identified sex-linked loci on Chr16, but in a different location than in the MGH cross (Howe et al. 2013).The identification of autosomal sex-associated loci (Chr3, Chr5, Chr16) could represent either the unmasking of weak sex determinants given the loss of the sar4, or the rapid evolution of new sex-determination systems after the divergence of EKW, which has the Chr4R sex-determination system, from the common ancestor of AB and TU.What causes male genotypes to develop only as males but female genotypes to sometimes develop as sex-reversed phenotypes? Answers likely lie in environmental factors and background genetic features that affect the strength of a meiotic oocyte-derived pro-female signal that inhibits oocyte apoptosis, probably by maintaining aromatase production (Slanchev et al. 2005; Houwing et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2007; Siegfried and Nusslein-Volhard 2008; Rodriguez-Mari et al. 2010, 2011; Rodríguez-Marí and Postlethwait 2011; Pradhan et al. 2012; Dranow et al. 2013). In general, harsh conditions, including high density and poor nutrition, tend to promote male development (Walker-Durchanek 1980; Pelegri and Schulte-Merker 1999; Shang et al. 2006; Lawrence et al. 2008; Abozaid et al. 2011, 2012; Liew et al. 2012; Villamizar et al. 2012). These harsh factors may act to decrease the pro-female signal by depressing the pool of meiotic oocytes, either by inhibiting primary germ-cell proliferation or entry into meiosis or by promoting oocyte apoptosis. Sex reversals can happen even in species with a strong genetic sex determinant. In medaka, high temperature and hypoxia can cause female-to-male sex reversal, accompanied by increased cortisol and depressed aromatase (Sato et al. 2005; Hattori et al. 2007; Selim et al. 2009; Kitano et al. 2012; Cheung et al. 2014). It remains to be tested whether stressful conditions cause sex reversal in zebrafish by a similar mechanism.In addition to environmental factors, background genetic factors might decrease the strength of sar4 activity in domesticated stocks. Although our experiments showed that WIK has a strong sex determinant, inbreeding, which results in homozygosis of partially deleterious alleles, biases WIK fish toward male development (Brown et al. 2012a). Especially likely would be an interaction of background genotype with environmental factors that could override the influence of sar4 on phenotypic sex.Did AB and TU lose sar4 independently or was this feature present in the last common ancestor of the two strains? Phylogenomic analyses showed that AB and TU occupy a monophyletic sister clade to EKW, suggesting that AB and TU may have been derived from EKW-related fish—AB from a pet store in Oregon and TU from a pet store in Germany. By parsimony, these results do not rule out the possibility that the lack of sex-linked loci in Chr4R was a shared trait derived from the last common ancestor of AB and TU. Nevertheless, due to their independent domestication in Eugene and Tuebingen, and the presence of sar4 in EKW, we suspect that the loss of a strong sex determinant occurred independently during the separate domestication of the two lineages, a conclusion that is not incompatible with the phylogenomic data.Analysis of the mitochondrial genome-encoded cytb gene showed that our strains all derived from mitochondrial haplogroup 1, suggesting that a broader understanding of the genetics of sex determination across the full diversity of zebrafish will require investigations of haplogroups 2 and 3 (populations in Nepal and Southern India, respectively), which diverged from haplogroup 1 about 3 million years ago (Whiteley et al. 2011). Investigations of Danio species closely related to zebrafish will also add to our understanding, although the sar4 sex-determination locus may not be widely conserved with other danios. The closest lineage to zebrafish (Cypriniformes; Cyprinidae; Danio) that has a genome-wide analysis of conserved syntenies is the gudgeon (Cypriniformes; Cyprinidae; Gnathopogon) (Kakioka et al. 2013), whose lineage separated from the zebrafish lineage about 117 million years ago (Saitoh et al. 2011). Analyses showed strong conservation of syntenies among all zebrafish chromosomes except Chr4R (Kakioka et al. 2013).Results presented here show that zebrafish in nature has a strong sex determinant linked to the right tip of Chr4, the only chromosome arm with cytogenetic features frequently found in sex chromosomes; that the determinant is necessary but not sufficient for female development; and that in natural populations, females are WZ and males are ZZ. In contrast, domesticated strains cleaned of background mutations for mutagenesis experiments lack or have greatly weakened versions of the Chr4 sex-determination system.These conclusions have several important implications:Because domesticated strains make males and females (often with widely fluctuating sex ratios) even without the full complement of natural genetic sex determinants, these strains apparently have a functional sex-determining mechanism, perhaps due to polygenic sex determination unmasked by the evolutionary strengthening of weak sex-ratio modifiers under the heavy hand of “unnatural selection” wielded by zebrafish researchers, or the unmasking of latent but preexisting environmental sex-determination mechanisms.Some studies investigating the biology of zebrafish sex determination using TU and AB fish should be revisited using sex-genotyped animals from a strain that possesses the natural genetic sex determinant.Although mechanisms downstream of sar4 are likely to be the same in all zebrafish stocks, future work that includes studies of natural strains containing the wild sex determinants would provide richer understanding.The zebrafish genome sequence, which was derived mainly from TU with input from AB and substantial correction using the SATmap, is unlikely to contain strong alleles of both the male and the female alternatives of the major natural sex-determining gene.We need to concentrate efforts to identify the molecular genetic basis of wild sex in zebrafish.We thank Bill Trevarrow (Eugene Research Aquatics, LLC) for obtaining Nadia and Cooch Behar fish and Yann Guiguen and William Cresko for helpful discussions.

FSHR is a G protein-coupled, seven-transmembrane receptor linked to the adenylyl cyclase or other pathways and is expressed in gonadal somatic cells. In some nonmammalian species, fshr expression is much higher in the ovary than in the testis during gonadal sex differentiation, suggesting that FSHR is involved in ovarian development in nonmammalian vertebrates. However, little is known of FSHR knockout phenotypes in these species. Here we screened for fshr mutations by a medaka (Oryzias latipes) target-induced local lesion in the genomes and identified one nonsense mutation located in the BXXBB motif, which is involved in G protein activation. Next, we used an in vitro reporter gene assay to demonstrate that this mutation prevents FSHR function. We then analyzed the phenotypes of fshr mutant medaka. The fshr mutant male medaka displayed normal testes and were fertile, whereas the mutant female fish displayed small ovaries and were infertile because vitellogenesis was inhibited. The mutant females also have suppressed expression of ovary-type aromatase (cyp19a1a), a steroidogenic enzyme responsible for the conversion of androgens to estrogens, resulting in decreased 17β-estradiol levels. Moreover, loss of FSHR function caused female-to-male sex reversal in some cases. In addition, the transgenic overexpression of fshr in fshr mutants rescued FSHR function. These findings strongly suggest that in the medaka, FSH regulates the ovarian development and the maintenance mainly by the elevation of estrogen levels. We present the first FSHR knockout phenotype in a nonmammalian species.FSH, a glycoprotein hormone, is circulated from the pituitary and plays an essential role in vertebrate reproduction by binding to a specific receptor (1, 2). The FSH receptor (FSHR) is a G protein-coupled, seven-transmembrane receptor linked to the adenylyl cyclase or other pathways (3). In mammals, FSHR is expressed exclusively in Sertoli cells, and FSHR-deficient mice display small testes and a partial failure of spermatogenesis; however, they are fertile (4). In female mice, FSHR is expressed in granulosa cells, and knockout mice display thin uteri and small ovaries and are sterile because of a block in folliculogenesis before antral follicle formation (4). Moreover, the lack of FSH signaling in the female mice causes severe ovarian underdevelopment, producing chronic estrogen deficiency (5). Thus, in the mammals, FSH signaling plays a crucial role in ovarian development but is not essential in testicular development.In nonmammalian vertebrates, FSHR is expressed not only in Sertoli cells of the testis and granulosa cells of the ovary but also in Leydig cells of the testis and theca cells of the vitellogenic ovarian follicle (6–9). Recently it has been reported in chickens (10, 11), amphibians (12), and teleost fish (13–15) that although fshβ expression is equally detected in the pituitaries of both sexes during gonadal sex differentiation, fshr expression is much higher in the ovary than in the testis, similar to the expression pattern of ovary-type aromatase (cyp19a1a), a steroidogenic enzyme responsible for the conversion of androgens to estrogens (16–19). Moreover, we have shown that in the Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), a teleost with temperature-dependent sex determination, exposure of undifferentiated gonads to recombinant FSH causes cyp19a1a expression, suggesting that FSH signaling has a capacity for inducing cyp19a1a expression in gonads (20). On the other hand, an aromatase inhibitor has been shown to induce masculinization in chickens (21), reptiles (22–24), amphibians (25), and teleost fish (26–28). More recently it has been reported in two gonochoristic fish species, Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and medaka (Oryzias latipes), in which the depletion of 17β-estradiol (E2) by aromatase inhibitors results in a functional female-to-male sex reversal in the sexually mature adults (29). Therefore, these findings suggest that estrogen induced by FSH plays a pivotal role in maintaining the female phenotype as well as in the ovarian development in the nonmammalian species. However, little is known of the phenotypes resulting from knocked-out FSH signaling in these species.Medaka is a small fish with several desirable features for use as a model organism, including a short generation time, small genome size, and the availability of numerous useful strains (30). Transgenic (Tg) techniques and the gene knockout method of targeting-induced local lesions in genome (TILLING) have been established in this fish (31, 32). Furthermore, DMY/dmrt1bY, the medaka sex-determining gene, which is located on the Y chromosome, has been identified (33–35). Thus, medaka is an excellent vertebrate model for the molecular genetic analysis of various biological phenomena, including embryonic development and sex differentiation. The first appearance of morphological sex differentiation in medaka occurs before hatching and is observed as a significant difference in the number of germ cells between the sexes; genetic female fish (XX) have more germ cells than genetic male fish (XY). In XY gonads, these germ cells enter mitotic arrest, whereas they initiate oogenesis in XX gonads (36–38). High water temperature treatment (32–34°C) during the sex differentiation period causes masculinization of XX medaka (39), whereas a more recent report indicated that high water temperature treatment causes female-to-male sex reversal by elevating cortisol, the major glucocorticoid produced by the interrenal cells in teleosts, and which suppresses germ cell proliferation and fshr expression (14). However, it remains unclear whether the suppression of fshr expression actually induces masculinization of XX medaka.In this paper, we isolated an fshr mutant from a medaka TILLING library and analyzed the phenotypes of the mutant medaka. In addition, we rescued FSHR function in the mutant by transgenic overexpression of fshr.The study was performed using protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Kumamoto University. All fish were dissected under cold anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.Two medaka strains were used, the Cab and FLFII strains (40). The Cab strain was used to establish a medaka TILLING library (32) and to generate F2 fish, and the FLFII strain was used for backcrossing and as a wild-type control in the phenotype analyses.The medaka TILLING library has sets of frozen sperm and genomic DNA that were obtained from 5771 F1 male fish (32). To screen the library for fshr mutants, genomic PCR and high-resolution melting (HRM) analyses were performed as previously described (41) using Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) and ResoLight Dye (Roche) on a LightCycler 480 (Roche) with the following fshr primers (forward and reverse) [DNA DataBank of Japan (DDBJ) accession number AB526237]: exons 3–4, 5′-TCTGCCTCTCTCAACCC-3′ and 5′-CAAGAATCTGCCTCAATACTTAC-3′, and exon 14, 5′-CCTGCAGGTGAGTGTCTGTC-3′ and 3′-GTGTACTGGTGGATAGTTGG-3′. The conditions were as follows: preheating at 95°C for 5 minutes, 45 cycles of PCR at 95°C for 10 seconds, 59°C for 10 seconds, 72°C for 10 seconds, and finally heating at 0.3°C/sec. Fluorescence measurements were collected from 40°C to 80°C, and melting curves were analyzed using LightCycler 480 software. The PCR products selected as mutation candidates by an analysis of melting curves were purified using a ProbeQuant G-50 microcolumn (GE Healthcare) and then sequenced on a 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies) using an BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Life Technologies).The genetic sex of each adult fish was determined by genomic PCR as previously described (14). PCR was performed using primers specific for dmy (DDBJ accession number AB071534: 5′-GTCAAGGCAGAGTTTGAGAG-3′ and 5′-CATTGTGACCAACATCTTCTG-3′). The conditions were as follows: preheating at 95°C for 10 minutes, 40 cycles of PCR at 94°C for 30 seconds, 59°C for 30 seconds, 72°C for 1 minute, and a final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes.The genotyping of the fshrR631X mutation was performed by two-step genomic PCR and HRM analyses. First, PCR was performed as previously described (14) with the following primers (forward and reverse): 5′-ATC TAC TTG ACC TAC CGC AAG C-3′ and 5′-ACT GAG AGT ATT GGC CAA GGA G-3′. The conditions were as follows: preheating at 95°C for 10 minutes, 40 cycles of PCR at 94°C for 30 seconds, 59°C for 30 seconds, 72°C for 1 minute, and final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes. Nested PCR and HRM analyses were performed using Taq DNA polymerase (Roche) and ResoLight Dye (Roche) on a LightCycler 480 (Roche) with a 3′-phosphorylated probe (5′-TTCACCCGTACTTTTCGACGGGACTTCTT-P-3′) and the following primers (forward and reverse): 5′-CAGACTCCAAACTCCTTCTGGT-3′ and 5′-AGATCTGCGCTCGAGTCTTAAA-3′. The conditions were as follows: preheating at 95°C for 10 minutes, 35 cycles of PCR at 95°C for 10 seconds, 55°C for 10 seconds, 72°C for 10 seconds, and finally heating at 0.3°C/sec. Fluorescence measurements were collected from 40°C to 80°C, and melting curves were analyzed using LightCycler 480 software (Roche).The Japanese flounder cyp19a1a-luciferase reporter was used as a cAMP-responsive reporter (13). Wild-type and mutant fshr-expression plasmids were constructed by inserting medaka wild-type and mutant fshr open reading frame cDNAs into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). For the rescue experiment, a fshr-fshr plasmid was constructed by inserting the fshr promoter (3745 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon; DDBJ accession number AB526251) and an Simian virus 40 polyadenylation signal sequence into the 5′-and 3′-multiple cloning sites of the phosphorylated enhanced green fluorescent protein plasmid (CLONTECH), respectively, and by then replacing the enhanced green fluorescent protein coding sequence with the fshr open reading frame cDNA. To increase the transgene integration efficiency in medaka embryos, an I-SceI recognition site (5′-TTAGGGATAACAGGGTAATT-3′) was inserted into fshr-fshr and olvas-DsRedExpress plasmids (14).Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum (HyClone) at 37°C. Cells were plated in 24-well plates 24 hours before transfection. The cells were transfected with 240 ng of the cyp19a1a-luciferase reporter, 100 ng of the wild-type fshr expression, mutant fshr expression, or empty plasmid (control) and 40 ng of pRL-TK Renilla luciferase normalization plasmid (Nippon Gene) using the Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were then incubated with recombinant seabream FSH (rFSH) or recombinant seabream LH (rLH) at 37°C for 24 hours (20). The rFSH and rLH are made by the baculovirus expression system (42). The luciferase assay was performed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a MiniLumat LB9506 (Berthold) as described previously (13). All transfections were performed in tetraplicate.The adult gonads and livers of wild-type and fshr mutant medaka at about 6 months of age were weighed, and GSI and HSI were calculated as follows: GSI (percentage) = gonad weight (grams) × 100/body weight (grams); HSI (percentage) = liver weight (grams) × 100/body weight (grams).Total RNA was extracted from the gonads and livers of medaka adults using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene). One microgram of RNA was then reverse transcribed using an RNA PCR kit (Applied Biosystems) at 42°C for 30 minutes. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed as previously described (43) using SYBR Green I Master (Roche) on a LightCycler 480 (Roche) with the following primers (forward and reverse): cyp19a1a (DDBJ accession number D82968), 5′-ATGGATCTGATCCCTGCTTG-3′ and 5′-CCACACTCGAACAATGTCTC-3′; progesterone receptor (pr; DDBJ accession number AB360545), 5′-GATGGAGAGTAAAATGAACGG-3′ and 5′-GACAAAATCCTCCCACGGAG-3′; vitellogenin 1 (vtg1; DDBJ accession number AB064320), 5′-TGGAAAGGCTGATGGGGAAG-3′ and 5′-AACTGCAGGCAAGGTGAGCC-3′; elongation factor 1α (ef1α; DDBJ accession number AB013606), 5′-TGAGATGGGCAAGGGCTCCT-3′ and 5′-GCTGGGTTGTAGCCGATCTT-3′. The conditions were as follows: preheating at 95°C for 5 minutes and 45 cycles of PCR at 95°C for 10 seconds, 59°C for 10 seconds, and 72°C for 10 seconds. The copy number values of cyp19a1a, pr, and vtg1 were normalized to that of ef1α.Steroid hormones were extracted from the gonads of medaka adults different from the gene expression experiments in diethyl ether as described previously (19). E2 and T levels were measured using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Gonads of adult fish at about 6 months of age were fixed in Bouin's solution at 4°C overnight, embedded in paraffin, sectioned serially at a thickness of 5 μm, and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (14). The developmental stages of the oocytes were determined by the size and basic morphological characteristics (44).Both fshr-fshr and olvas-DsRedExpress plasmids were simultaneously injected into one-cell stage embryos of F8 mutant medaka with an I-SceI endonuclease (New England Biolabs) using a Nanoject II (Drummond Scientific Co). All embryos were bred to adults and the sexually matured fishes were pair mated to non-Tg medaka. Only embryos possessing DsRed fluorescence were selected and bred to adults. These fish were checked by PCR with the fshr-specific primers (5′-TGATCATTGTTCTCATGGAA-3′ and 5′-AAGAGCCGAGGGAGGTTTGC-3′) to determine whether the fshr-fshr plasmid was integrated into the genome. Transgene-positive fish were then used to produce subsequent generations.Experimental results were tested using Levene's test for homogeneity of variance. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and then tested with the Turkey's multiple comparison test.A total of 5760 stock DNAs of a medaka TILLING library were screened for mutation in exons 3, 4, and 14 of fshr using HRM analysis and sequencing, and six missense mutations (D81Y, C87W, F116C, T123I, I650T, and S656T) and one nonsense mutation (R631X) were found. Because the nonsense mutation was located in the BXXBB motif, which is involved in G protein activation (45) and truncated the carboxyl terminus, it was selected to generate fshr mutant medaka (Figure 1). F2 fishes were produced by in vitro artificial insemination of Cab strain eggs with frozen sperm possessing the mutation, which were prepared from F1 male medaka (32). F3 and F4 medaka were produced by mating heterozygous (+/R631X) males with the FLFII females, and F5 fishes were produced by mating +/R631X males with +/R631X females (Figure 2). At and after the F6 generation, homozygous mutant (R631X/R631X) medaka were produced by mating R631X/R631X XY male fish with +/R631X XX female fish (Figure 2).Identification of fshr mutations from a medaka TILLING library.

F2 fishes were produced by in vitro artificial insemination of Cab strain eggs with frozen sperm possessing the mutation. The F3 and F4 medaka were produced by mating heterozygous (+/−) male fish with the FLFII female fish, and F5 fishes were produced by mating +/− males with +/− females. At and after the F6 generation, homozygous mutant (−/−) medaka were produced by mating −/− XY male fish with +/− XX female fish. The fshr-fshr/olvas-DsRedExpress Tg medaka line was generated using F8 mutant embryos.To investigate whether the mutant fshr can actually transmit a FSH signal, a luciferase transfection assay was carried out using the cyp19a1a-luciferase reporter in HEK293 cells. FSH stimulates cyp19 gene transcription via the elevation of the cAMP second messenger in rat granulosa cells (46). Luciferase activity was induced in cells transfected with wild-type fshr after treatment with rFSH but not with rLH; however, no activity was induced in cells transfected with mutant fshr after treatment with either rFSH or rLH (Figure 3). Therefore, FSHR containing an R631X mutation is likely to be nonfunctional in medaka.Luciferase reporter assay using the cyp19a1a-luciferase reporter in HEK293 cells. Relative luciferase activity was calculated based on the value of the control without treatment. Vertical bar, mean ± SEM of tetraplicates. **, P < .01.F6 and F7 generation fshr mutant (R631X/R631X) medaka were produced by mating R631X/R631X XY male fish with +/R631X XX female fish (Figure 2) and were used for the phenotype analysis. The mutant XY male medaka displayed normal testes (Figure 4A) and livers (Figure 4B) and were normally fertile. All mutant XX female medaka displayed small ovaries (Figure 4A) and normal livers (Figure 4B) and were infertile. Mutant XX male fish appeared at a frequency of about 10% and 9% in F6 and F7 generations, respectively (Table 1). Histological examination showed that all mutant XY and the sex-reversed XX male medaka had normal testes with productive spermatogenesis, similar to wild-type fish (Figure 4, C–E). Conversely, all mutant XX female medaka had immature ovaries containing only previtellogenic oocytes (stages I-IV) (Figure 4G), which was in contrast to wild-type fish, which had mature ovaries containing many vitellogenic oocytes (Figure 4F). Atretic follicles were not observed in all mutant XX female medaka. Thus, loss of FSHR function caused female-to-male sex reversal and gonadal abnormality in female medaka but not in male fish.Growth status of adult organs and histological analysis of gonads in wild-type (+/+) and fshr mutant (−/−) medaka.

The expression levels of pr and vtg1 are known to be elevated by E2 (47, 48). Their expression levels were significantly lower in the mutant females medaka compared with those in wild-type female fish at the adult stage (Figure 5, A–C). We also measured the levels of E2 and T by an enzyme immunoassay. E2 levels were significantly lower in the mutant female medaka than in wild-type female fish (Figure 5D), whereas there was no difference in T levels between mutant and wild-type female fish at the adult stage (Figure 5E). Conversely, cyp19a1a, pr, and vtg1 expression and steroid hormone levels were low in both mutant and wild-type male fish (Figure 5, A–E). These findings show that the fshr mutant female medaka have suppressed cyp19a1a mRNA expression and consequently decreased E2 levels.Quantitative analyses of gene expression and steroid hormone levels in wild-type (+/+) and fshr mutant (−/−) medaka.

DsRed-positive embryos were selected and checked by PCR for genomic integration of the fshr-fshr plasmid. Tg XX medaka did not sex reverse (Table 1), and three of five Tg XX female fish spawned fertilized eggs after mating with the Tg XY male fish. Histological examination showed that all Tg XX male medaka had normal testes with productive spermatogenesis (Figure 6, A–C), and all Tg XX female fish had well-developed ovaries containing many vitellogenic oocytes, similar to wild-type fish (Figure 6, D–F). These results indicate that the function of FSHR is rescued in this Tg mutant medaka.Histological analysis of adult gonads in fshr-fshr/olvas-DsRedExpress Tg mutant [−/− (fshr Tg)] medaka.

Bar, 100 μm.In this study, we have demonstrated that fshr mutant male medaka display normal testes and are fertile, whereas the mutant female fish display small ovaries and are infertile because vitellogenesis is inhibited. Moreover, the loss of FSHR function caused females-to-male sex reversal in some cases. In mice, FSHR-deficient males display small testes and partial spermatogenic failure but are fertile, whereas the deficient females display thin uteri and small ovaries and are sterile because of a block in folliculogenesis before antral follicle formation (4). In addition, a lack of FSH signaling in females causes severe ovarian underdevelopment producing chronic estrogen deficiency (5). Thus, FSH signaling appears to play a crucial role in ovarian development but is not essential in testicular development in mice and medaka. Moreover, the expression levels of cyp19a1a and estrogen-responsive genes, pr and vtg1, and E2 levels in fshr mutant female medaka were significantly lower than those in wild-type female fish. No differences in T levels between mutant and wild-type medaka were seen. These findings strongly suggest that FSH signaling induces cyp19a1a expression and resultant elevation of E2 levels in female medaka.It has been previously reported that the gonadal phenotypes of aromatase knockout female mice are similar to those of FSHR knockout females (5). Aromatase knockout female mice are infertile because of folliculogenic disruption and a failure to ovulate (49). The age-dependent ovary phenotype revealed a block in follicular development at the antral stage and a complete absence of corpora lutea (47, 49). Conversely, in nonmammalian vertebrates, an aromatase inhibitor has been known to induce female-to-male sex reversal (21–29). In this study, loss of FSHR function caused masculinization and gonadal abnormality in XX medaka, similar to the gonadal phenotypes of estrogen deficiency in other vertebrate species. Therefore, the FSH signaling in the medaka appears to regulate the ovarian development and maintenance mainly by elevation of estrogen levels.In the present study, we have successfully screened a medaka TILLING library and isolated one nonsense mutation of fshr located in the BXXBB motif, which is involved in G protein activation (45). To confirm whether the mutant fshr can actually transmit a FSH signal, a luciferase transfection assay was performed. We used a luciferase reporter driven by the Japanese flounder cyp19a1a promoter containing a cAMP-responsive element (CRE) and performed the assay in HEK293 cells. A previous study using HEK293 cells showed that a cAMP analog induced luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner when using a cyp19a1a promoter containing a CRE but not when using the same promoter lacking a CRE, suggesting the functionality of the CRE within the cyp19a1a promoter (13). Wild-type fshr induced luciferase activity after treatment with rFSH but not rLH, whereas the mutant fshr did not induce luciferase activity after treatment with either rFSH or rLH. These results suggest that the mutant fshr is not functional owing to truncation of the intracellular region of the carboxyl terminus. FSH is known to stimulate cyp19 transcription in rat granulosa cells via the elevation of cAMP (46). In medaka, as in Japanese flounder, there is at least one CRE within the cyp19a1a promoter (50). Therefore, FSH may directly regulate cyp19a1a expression in medaka by binding to the CRE, although further investigation is needed to confirm this.Rescue of the mutant FSHR phenotypes in the fshr-overexpressed Tg mutant line demonstrated that the phenotypes of the mutant medaka are due to the loss of FSHR function. The fshr-overexpressed Tg line was generated using the fshr-fshr plasmid, which uses the medaka fshr promoter to drive fshr expression. This promoter contains at least one functional glucocorticoid-responsive element and two Ad4 sites (14). Medaka FTZ-F1, the medaka ortholog of mammalian steroidogenic factor 1, specifically binds to Ad4 sites (14) and is known to be expressed in gonadal somatic cells during the embryonic development (51) and in ovarian follicles (52), similar to the expression patterns of fshr. Therefore, the fshr promoter is likely to drive a certain level of the fshr expression in gonadal somatic cells from the embryonic developmental stage to the adult stage.Recently it has been reported in some nonmammalian species, including medaka, the expression of fshr is much higher in the ovary than in the testis during gonadal sex differentiation (10–15). On the other hand, fshr expression is strongly detected in the adult ovary and testis in many species (53–56), suggesting that FSH signaling plays an important role in the adult gonads of both sexes. In mice, FSHR-deficient males display small testes and partial spermatogenic failure (4). Although FSH signaling is not essential for initiating spermatogenesis, it appears to be required for adequate viability and motility of the sperms (4). In this study, the abnormality of spermatogenesis in fshr mutant male medaka was not identified by morphological and histological observations of testes and measurement of steroids. Accordingly, future studies will focus on a detailed phenotypic analysis of fshr mutant male fish.In summary, this is the first presentation of the knockout phenotype of FSHR in a nonmammalian vertebrate. The fshr mutant male medaka displayed normal testes and were fertile, whereas the mutant female fish displayed small ovaries and were infertile because vitellogenesis was inhibited. The mutant female medaka also suppressed cyp19a1a mRNA expression with a resultant decrease in E2 levels, and a loss of FSHR function caused female-to-male sex reversal in some cases. In addition, FSHR function was rescued in mutant medaka by the fshr-overexpressed transgene. These findings strongly suggest that FSH regulates ovarian development and maintenance in medaka, mainly by elevation of estrogen levels.We thank Dr Koichiro Gen (National Research Institute of Aquaculture, Japan) for the kind gift of rFSH and rLH; Dr Yasutoshi Yoshiura (National Research Institute of Aquaculture) for helpful advice; and Y.

The vasa gene plays a crucial role in the development of germ cell lineage and has become an excellent molecular marker in identifying germ cells in teleosts. However, little is known about the structure and function of the vasa gene in flatfish. In this study, the vasa gene (Csvasa) was isolated and characterized in half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis), an economically important flatfish in China. In the obtained 6425-bp genomic sequence, 23 exons and 22 introns were identified. The Csvasa gene encodes a 663-amino acid protein, including highly conserved domains of the DEAD-box protein family. The amino acid sequence also shared a high homology with other teleosts. Csvasa expression was mainly restricted to the gonads, with little or no expression in other tissues. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that Csvasa expression levels decreased during embryonic and early developmental stages and increased with the primordial germ cell proliferation. A typical sexually dimorphic expression pattern of Csvasa was observed during early development and sex differentiation, suggesting that the Csvasa gene might play a differential role in the proliferation and differentiation of male and female primordial germ cells (PGCs). Csvasa mRNA expression levels in neomales were significantly lower than those in normal males and females, indicating that the Csvasa gene might be implicated in germ cell development after sex reversal by temperature treatment. In addition, medaka (Oryzias latipes) PGCs could be transiently labeled by microinjection of synthesized mRNA containing the green fluorescence protein gene and 3′-untranslated region of Csvasa, which confirmed that the Csvasa gene has the potential to be used as a visual molecular marker of germ cells and laid a foundation for manipulation of PGCs in tongue sole reproduction.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) libraries were constructed using mRNA from the stage IV ovary and the ovotestis. In total 100 positive clones from the libraries were selected at random and sequenced, and then expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were used to search against sequences in the GenBank database using the BLASTn and BLASTx search algorithms. High quality SSH cDNA libraries and 90 ESTs were obtained. Of these ESTs, 43 showed high homology with genes of known function and these are associated with energy metabolism, signal transduction, transcription regulation and so on. The remaining 47 ESTs shared no homology with any genes in GenBank and are thus considered to be hypothetical genes. Furthermore, the four genes F11, F63, R11, and R47 from the forward and reverse libraries were analyzed in gonad, brain, heart, spleen, liver, kidney and muscle tissues. The results showed that the transcription of the F11 and F63 genes was significantly increased while the expression of the R11 and R47 genes was significantly decreased from IV or V ovary. In addition, the results also indicated that the four genes' expression was not gonad-tissue specific. This results strongly suggested that they may be involved in the rice field eel gonad development and/or sex reversal.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

However, underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We report the identification of five DM (doublesex and mab-3) domain genes in the swamp eel that include Dmrt2, Dmrt2b, Dmrt3, Dmrt4 and Dmrt5, which encode putative proteins of 527, 373, 471, 420 and 448 amino acids, respectively. Phylogenetic tree showed that these genes are clustered into corresponding branches of the DM genes in vertebrates. Southern blot analysis indicated that the Dmrt1–Dmrt3–Dmrt2 genes are tightly linked in a conserved gene cluster. Notably, these Dmrt genes are up-regulated during gonad transformation. Furthermore, mRNA in situ hybridisation showed that Dmrt2, Dmrt3, Dmrt4 and Dmrt5 are expressed in developing germ cells. These results are evidence that the DM genes are involved in sexual differentiation in the swamp eel.This is a preview of subscription content, log in to check access.Liu CK (1944) Rudimentary hermaphroditism in the Symbranchoid eel, Monopterus javanesis.

At the early life stage, fertilized eggs were exposed to 5, 50, 500, 5000 ng/L E3 for 15 days, and the hatched fry were exposed continuously to the same concentrations for an additional 15 days. Exposure to 500 and 5000 ng/L E3 resulted in adverse effects on hatchability and time to hatching. At 5000 ng/L, the gross abnormality rate was increased and the number of females that hatched was twice that of males. When the fish were exposed to 5–5000 ng/L E3 for further 60 days, the male hepatosomatic index (HSI) was increased at 5000 ng/L. The female gonadosomatic index (GSI) was decreased at 500 and 5000 ng/L E3, while the male GSI at 5000 ng/L E3 was increased and sex reversal was also found at this concentration. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the hepatic vitellogenin-I (Vtg-I) genes were up-regulated in females at 500 and 5000 ng/L E3 and in males at all E3 concentrations, whereas E3 did not affect estrogen receptor α (ERα) mRNA transcription. These results showed that E3 at environmental concentration of 5 ng/L has no adverse effects on growth and development of the Japanese medaka. However, in this study, if we only focused on Vtg gene change in males, E3 had strong estrogenic effects on male medaka under the conditions of these experiments.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

In the family Syngnathidae (pipefish, seahorses, and seadragons), males provide all parental care by carrying developing embryos on their ventral surfaces, and females develop secondary sex characters. Syngnathids exhibit a variety of genetic mating patterns, making them an ideal group to test predictions of sexual selection theory. Here, we describe the mating system of the black-striped pipefish Syngnathus abaster, using 4 highly variable microsatellites to analyze parentage of 102 embryos. Results revealed that 1) both sexes mate multiple times over the course of a pregnancy (polygynandrous mating system), 2) eggs are spatially segregated by maternity within each brood pouch, and 3) larger females have higher mating success (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test; P < 0.05). Together with similar studies of other syngnathid species, our results support the hypothesis that the mating system is related to the intensity of sexual dimorphism.The study of mating systems has had a long-standing tradition in evolutionary biology and ecology. A wide range of studies has led to the general expectation that the mating system is closely related to the intensity of sexual selection and the degree of sexual dimorphism (Avise et al. 2002; Shuster and Wade 2003; Rosenqvist and Berglund 2011). Darwin (1871) suggested that, in organisms with conventional sex roles, more polygynous species show greater degrees of sexual dimorphism, as a result of an increased intensity in sexual selection. Analogous to Darwin’s theory, it could be expected that, in organisms with reversed sex roles, more polyandrous species exhibit higher levels of sexual dimorphism (Jehl and Murray 1986). The study of mating systems in sex-role–reversed species, therefore, provides exceptional opportunities to test predictions of sexual selection theory (Williams 1975; Wilson et al. 2003).Frequent occurrences of sex-role reversal can be found in the family Syngnathidae including pipefish, seahorses, and seadragons (Berglund and Rosenqvist 2003). These species are interesting because of male pregnancy, in which males provide all postzygotic care by brooding embryos on their ventral surfaces. The phenomenon of male pregnancy results in a higher investment by males than by females, and females must compete more than males for access to mates (Berglund and Rosenqvist 1993). Female length in particular seems to play an important role in the competition for access to mates (Ripley and Foran 2006; Paczolt and Jones 2010).Microsatellite-based studies have revealed a wide range of genetic mating patterns in syngnathid fishes, making them an ideal group to investigate the relationship between the mating system and the degree of sexual dimorphism in sex-role–reversed species (Jones and Avise 2001). The sexually dimorphic gulf pipefish Syngnathus scovelli (Evermann and Kendall, 1896), for example, is characterized by a polyandrous mating system, in which males receive eggs from only 1 female but females mate with multiple males (Jones and Avise 1997a). Polygynandrous mating systems, in which both males and females mate multiple times over the course of a single pregnancy, have been reported for 2 pipefish species with intermediate levels of sexual dimorphism: the broad-nosed pipefish Syngnathus typhle (Linnaeus, 1758) and the dusky pipefish Syngnathus floridae (Jordan and Gilbert, 1882) (Jones and Avise 1997b; Jones et al. 1999). As in most seahorses, the narrow-bellied seahorse Hippocampus subelongatus Castelnau, 1873 displays little sexual dimorphism and is characterized by a monogamous mating system, in which 1 male mates solely with 1 female (Jones et al. 1998). To date, only polygyny has not yet been documented in the family Syngnathidae.These previous studies support the hypothesis that in sex-role–reversed organisms, more polyandrous species show higher degrees of sexual dimorphism as a result of an increased intensity in sexual selection (Jones and Avise 2001). However, caution should be taken before broadly generalizing this pattern. The relation between mating systems, sexual selection, and sexual dimorphism is complicated, and additional descriptions of mating systems are needed to unravel its complexity (Rosenqvist and Berglund 2011).In this study, microsatellite markers are employed to assess the mating system of a population of the black-striped pipefish Syngnathus abaster (Risso, 1827) from the Ria Formosa lagoon (South Portugal, Figure 1) where it is the fifth most abundant species (Erzini et al. 2002) and can easily be collected in shallow seagrass meadows. Previous studies of S. abaster have focused mainly on its peculiar reproductive biology (Tomasini et al. 1991; Carcupino et al. 1997; Silva et al. 2009). Courtship behavior and modest levels of sexual dimorphism (females are slightly larger than males and show transient ornamentation patterns during mating season) suggest sex-role reversal in the black-striped pipefish (Silva et al. 2006). Visual observations of captive fish have shown that both sexes seek multiple mates during the course of a single pregnancy, suggesting a polygynandrous mating system (Silva et al. 2006). Genetic data on the natural mating system of S. abaster, however, are still lacking.Map of southern Portugal (A), the western part of the Ria Formosa lagoon (B), and the location of the sampled seagrass patch, running parallel to the shoreline (C).Under this framework, the main objective of the present study is to describe the mating system of S. abaster, using microsatellite-based parentage analysis. The primary aims are 1) to identify the number of females that contributed to each male’s brood, 2) to assess the spatial distribution of full- and half-sib embryos inside the male’s brood pouch, and 3) to document multiple mating of females. A secondary objective is to test for female sexual selection by assessing size differences between matched (females that are identified as mothers of the assayed embryos) and nonmatched females. The broader intent of the present study is to compare our results with previous studies of mating systems in syngnathids, addressing possible relationships between mating systems, sexual selection, and sexual dimorphism in sex-role–reversed species.Pipefish were collected during two 5-day periods (12–16 March 2012 and 26–30 March 2012) from a shallow seagrass bed in the Ria Formosa lagoon, located on the south coast of Portugal (36°59′N, 7°51′W) (Figure 1). Individuals were captured using a 7×1.60 m seine net of 5-mm mesh, which incorporated a central part (1 m length) of 3-mm mesh to enhance catching success. Pipefish identified as S. abaster were measured for total length to the nearest millimeter (LT; from tip of snout to tip of caudal fin) and sexed. Males can be distinguished by the presence of a brood pouch located ventrally on the tail and females by distension of the anterior portion of the trunk. Juveniles do not exhibit these sexual characteristics. Genetic samples of females (n = 74) were obtained from a small piece of caudal fin and immediately placed in ethanol (99%). Pregnant males (n = 21) were taken to the laboratory in a container filled with seawater, sacrificed by placing the container into a freezer at −20 °C, and preserved in ethanol (99%). Nonpregnant males, females, and juveniles were released at the sampling site.We dissected eggs (n = 508) from pregnant males, keeping track of their position within the brood pouch. The egg batch of each male was horizontally divided into 3 (up to 30 eggs) or 4 (up to 40 eggs) equal zones. Two eggs from each zone were randomly selected for genotyping (n = 102). Genomic DNA was isolated from fin clips (females and males) or eggs (embryos) following a protocol based on Sambrook et al. (1989) with minor modifications. To facilitate proteinase K digestion, eggs were cut into 4 pieces. Extracted DNA was quantified using a spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific NanoDrop™ 1000). Individuals were genotyped at 4 microsatellite loci (28B3, 28E6, 28E8, and 28F3) previously isolated and characterized for S. abaster by Diekmann et al. (2009). PCR conditions for microsatellite amplification varied depending on the DNA yield from the sample ( Appendix 1). PCR reactions were performed with the following program: an initial denaturation step of 5min at 95 °C, 34 cycles consisting of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at a locus-specific annealing temperature (58 °C for 28B3, 60 °C for 28E6 and 28E8, and 63 °C for 28F3), 30 s at 72 °C, followed by a final extension step of 1min at 72 °C. Fragment size was determined on an ABI prism 3130XL capillary sequencer using reverse primers labeled with FAM (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) (28E6) or HEX (Sigma-Aldrich) (28B3, 28E8, and 28F3) and the GeneScan-500 LIZ size standard (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Carlsbad, CA). Allele scoring was carried out with STRand 2.4.59 (http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/informatics/strand.php). Resulting raw allele sizes were binned using the R package MsatAllele (Alberto 2009).Parentage assessment was conducted with CERVUS 3.0 (Kalinowski et al. 2007). Given the genotypes of the embryos, of their known fathers, and of the potential mothers, the maternity was assigned to the female with the largest log-likelihood ratio Logarithm Of Odds (LOD). The assumed error rate was 0.01, the average nonexclusion probability (second parent) for all loci combined was 0.00004, and the proportion of candidate mothers sampled was 0.07. The number of females contributing to an egg batch was determined considering the order of embryos inside the brood pouch, and the minimum number of mothers was estimated with GERUD 2.0 (Jones 2005). The expected exclusion probability was 0.9999, considering that 1 parent was known with certainty, 1 unknown, and including the 4 loci. The power of GERUD was assessed with GERUDsim 2.0 (Jones 2005). Parameters were specified according to the observed reproduction biology of S. abaster, as suggested in the manual. For 7 runs with 500 iterations each, the percentage of the correctly reconstructed number of mothers was estimated as follows: 26.8% (run 1), 84.8% (run 2), 0% (run 3), 53.8% (run 4), 97% (run 5), 72% (run 6), and 95.6% (run 7). Because most of the runs revealed large percentages, we assumed that the applied microsatellites had enough power for parentage analysis. The nonparametric Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was performed to determine differences in length between matched (females that were identified as mothers of the assayed embryos) and nonmatched females.Allele frequencies, the number of alleles per locus, observed (Ho) and expected (He) heterozygosity were calculated using GENETIX 4.05.2 (Belkhir et al. 2004). For each locus, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was tested by the exact test using the Markov chain method in ARLEQUIN 3.0 (Excoffier et al. 2005). Considering all loci together, HWE was tested by the chi-square test using GENEPOP on the web 4.0.10 (Raymond and Rousset 1995). Deviations from HWE were characterized by FIS values (Weir and Cockerham 1984) with GENETIX. In instances where the observed genotype frequencies deviated significantly from HWE, the estimation of null allele frequencies, as the most probable cause of such HWE departures, was carried out using CERVUS.All 4 microsatellite loci were highly variable, which makes them extremely powerful for parentage assessment. The number of alleles per locus varied from 30 at 28E6 to 61 at 28B3 (Table 1). He averaged 0.958 across loci, ranging from 0.936 (28E6) to 0.976 (28B3). Significant deviation from HWE at a 0.05 α-level was detected only at locus 28B3 (P < 0.001). This deviation was characterized by a positive FIS value (FIS = 0.099), indicating a deficit of heterozygotes. Heterozygote deficiencies may be the result of biological factors such as genetic drift or inbreeding, or an indicator of null alleles.Genetic variability in samples of adult black-striped pipefish at 4 microsatellite loci used for parentage analysisFIS, inbreeding coefficient; He, expected heterozygosity; Ho, observed heterozygosity; HWE, deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium; NS = not significant.*P < 0.001.All females (n = 74) and pregnant males (n = 21) caught during sampling were successfully genotyped at each of the 4 loci. Only 16 of the pregnant males carried embryos sufficiently developed for microsatellite assay. From these males, 102 embryos were collected and genotyped at all 4 loci. CERVUS assigned all embryos to their known father without any mismatches. Thus, there is complete confidence of paternity of the broods from each S. abaster male. Among all assayed embryos, 41 (40%) could be assigned to specific females that were collected during sampling at a confidence level of 95% (Figure 2). Assigned embryos matched at all 4 microsatellite loci. The remaining 61 embryos (60%) showed mismatches from candidate females at 2 or more loci. In total, 41 females contributed to the broods of pregnant males, of which 16 were caught during sampling.Spatial distribution of full- and half-sib embryos inside male brood pouches of Syngnathus abaster.Eggs were spatially segregated by maternity within each brood pouch. On average, males contained 24.19±1.29 (standard error [SE]) eggs, ranging from 10 to 32 eggs. Each male received eggs from multiple females. The mean number of successful mates per male was 2.75±0.19 (SE), ranging from 2 to 4 mates (Figure 3). The occurrence of embryos with identical mothers in the brood pouches of different males indicated that females mated with multiple males as well. One female (ID = 33) contributed to 2 broods, and another female (ID = 24) contributed to 3 broods (Figure 2). On average, matched females successfully mated with at least 1.19±0.14 (SE) males.Mating success of male and female Syngnathus abaster.To test for sexual selection, the total length of females identified as mothers of the assayed embryos (8.2cm ± 0.13 SE) was compared with the total length of nonmatched females (7.5cm ± 0.09 SE). Matched females were significantly larger than nonmatched females (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test; P < 0.05). Pregnant males exhibited a mean total length of 8.4cm ± 0.14 (SE), ranging from 7.0 to 12.2cm.This study demonstrated a polygynandrous mating system in a sex-role–reversed species, S. abaster. It also provided information on the reproductive biology of this species, namely showing variance in female reproductive success that depends on a morphological trait, female size.Four highly polymorphic microsatellite markers were used to assign maternity. Previous parentage studies on syngnathids successfully used between 2 and 4 microsatellites (Jones et al. 1999; Mobley and Jones 2009; Wilson 2009). Maternity was assigned with high confidence indicating that markers were sufficiently powerful to reliably identify true mother–offspring relationships. Nonamplifying null alleles can potentially complicate microsatellite-based parentage analysis (Pemberton et al. 1995). However, the apparent presence of null alleles at locus 28B3 should not compromise parentage analysis. CERVUS treats mismatches caused by null alleles as if they are genotyping errors and can assign maternity on the basis of the other 3 loci (Kalinowski et al. 2007). The reasons given above indicate that maternity was accurately assigned.Pregnant S. abaster males carried an average of 24 eggs. This number seems small in comparison with the results of a previous study, which reported a mean clutch size of 37 eggs (Silva et al. 2006). Two factors apparently influence the number of eggs inside a male’s brood pouch: the male’s total length (Silva et al. 2008; Mobley and Jones 2009) and the timing of the breeding season (Riccato et al. 2003). Mean clutch size increases to a peak in the middle and decreases toward the end of breeding season. Given that pregnant males studied by Silva et al. (2006) exhibited lengths similar to those of our pregnant males, the observed small clutch size may rather be explained by the sampling dates at the beginning of the breading season. Thus, the number of eggs carried by S. abaster males is expected to further increase toward the middle of the breeding season.Each male received eggs from multiple females during the course of a single pregnancy. The mean number of successful mates per male was 2.8 ranging from 2 to 4 females. Previous genetic analysis revealed a lower level of multiple maternity in S. floridae (Jones and Avise 1997a) but a much higher rate of multiple mating in S. typhle males (Jones et al. 1999). Reasons for differences in the rate of multiple maternity may be various and are probably to be found in ecological factors, such as adult sex ratio, population density, and temporal availability of mates, all of which affect these species differentially (Shuster and Wade 2003; Kokko and Rankin 2006; Mobley and Jones 2009). Eggs were spatially segregated by maternity within each brood pouch. This result can be explained by the specific mating behavior of S. abaster. During copulation, the female deposits unfertilized eggs through an opening at the top of the male’s brood pouch. Immediately after egg transfer, males release sperm directly into the pouch (Dzyuba et al. 2008) and perform body contractions that cause packing of the eggs in the posterior end of the marsupium (Silva et al. 2006). Embryos from the first mating partner are therefore found at the pouch bottom, with eggs of successive mating partners stacked successively on top. A spatial segregation of eggs by maternity was also shown in S. typhle and S. floridae (Jones and Avise 1997b; Jones et al. 1999).Two females contributed to more than 1 brood, providing evidence for multiple mating of S. abaster females. However, the true rate of multiple mating by females is probably underestimated as the population was not sampled exhaustively, and females may have mated with additional males that were not collected. The undersampling of pregnant males seems to be small though, because individuals were shown to have equal catchability (Chapman’s test; P = 0.1103) and the observed sex ratio (0.9:1) was consistent with previous findings (Tomasini et al. 1991; Franzoi et al. 1993). However, given this potential sampling bias, the fact that multiple mating by females was discovered at all indicates that S. abaster females commonly mate with several males. Thus, the mating system of the black-striped pipefish can be described as polygynandrous with multiple mating by both sexes over the course of a single pregnancy. Although a polygynandrous mating system of S. abaster was previously reported (Silva et al. 2006), this is the first study presenting molecular evidence for multiple mating of S. abaster males and females.According to the theory of Trivers (1972), the sex with the largest investment becomes a limiting resource, causing the members of the other sex to compete for mating opportunities. In most animals, males must compete more than females for access to mates. In the family Syngnathidae, however, the phenomenon of male pregnancy results in a higher investment by males instead of females. The usual direction of sexual selection is therefore reversed, such that females compete more intensively for access to mates (Berglund and Rosenqvist 1993). As is shown in this study, female length seems to play an especially important role in the competition for access to mates. Matched females (females that are identified as mothers of the assayed embryos) were significantly larger than nonmatched females, suggesting that larger females outcompete smaller females for matings or that males prefer to mate with larger females. Preference of larger females was also shown for Syngnathus fuscus (Storer, 1839) and S. floridae (Ripley and Foran 2006). A study of mate choice in S. scovelli additionally showed that the elapsed time before mating took place was significantly shorter for larger females (Paczolt and Jones 2010). Furthermore, that study found that female size was positively correlated with the number of eggs transferred to the male’s pouch and with the number of viable offspring. Thus, larger females seem to confer more fitness than smaller females. By mating with large females, males are expected to benefit from enhanced offspring survivorship. Large females of S. abaster produce large eggs (Silva et al. 2008). Offspring hatching from larger eggs have been reported to have higher survival, higher resistance to starvation, and increased swimming performance (Kolm and Ahnesjo 2005).A wide range of mating systems have been documented in the family Syngnathidae, including monogamy in Hippocampus abdominalis (Lesson, 1827) and Hippocampus angustus (Günther, 1870) (Jones et al. 1998; Wilson and Martin-Smith 2007), polyandry in S. scovelli (Evermann and Kendall, 1896) and Nerophis ophidion (Linnaeus, 1758) (Jones and Avise 1997a; McCoy et al. 2001), and polygynandry in Syngnathus leptorhynchus (Girard, 1854), S. floridae, and S. typhle (Jones and Avise 1997b; Jones et al. 1999; Wilson 2009). In sex-role–reversed species, sexual selection and sexual dimorphism should be most extreme in polyandrous species, intermediate in polygynandrous, and least extreme in monogamous species (Jones and Avise 2001; Rosenqvist and Berglund 2011). In the polyandrous pipefish N. ophidion, for example, females have intense blue ornaments and are much larger than males (Rosenqvist 1990). By contrast, the polygynandrous pipefish S. typhle exhibits only transient female ornamentation during courtship and reduced levels of sexual size dimorphism (Berglund and Rosenqvist 1993). The monogamous seahorse H. subelongatus, finally, is sexually monomorphic (Jones et al. 1998). These and additional studies of syngnathid species reveal a trend generally consistent with sexual selection theory, predicting higher levels of sexual dimorphism in sex-role–reversed polyandrous species (Jones and Avise 2001; Rosenqvist and Berglund 2011). Results of the present study further support the hypothesis because S. abaster displays intermediate levels of sexual dimorphism (females show transient coloration during mating season and are slightly larger than males; Silva et al. 2009) and exhibits a polygyandrous mating system.However, the relationships between mating system, intensity of sexual selection, and degree of sexual dimorphism are very complex and are affected by various environmental, temporal, and demographic factors (Shuster and Wade 2003; Mobley and Jones 2009). Future studies on mating systems, especially of other syngnathid taxa and sex-role–reversed species outside the family Syngnathidae, would be highly valuable to gain a deeper understanding in sexual selection theory and the evolution of mating systems.FCT-Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia, Portugal (PTDC/MAR-EST/4331/2012); SENECA Foundation, Murcia government, Spain (11881/PI/09); Erasmus Mundus grant (2009-0089/001 Frame MUNB 123 to K.H.) as part of the European MSc in Marine Biodiversity and Conservation; FCT-Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia, Portugal (SFRH/BPD/70689/2010 to M.G.W., SFRH/BPD/64990/2009 to O.D.).We thank 18 motivated helpers, especially Niki-Eleftheria Koutsiampela and Tim Kiessling, who assisted during field work.Google ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarData deposited at Dryad: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.n3q59Corresponding Editor: Stewart GrantOxford University Press is a department of the University of Oxford.

Adverse effects on hatchability, time to hatching, and gross abnormalities occurred at 50 ng L−1 or above. Then the fry were divided into a continual exposure group, and a water recovery group. When the fry were exposed to E1 for another 60 d, there was a decrease in the hepatosomatic index (HSI) of males and the influence disappeared in the water recovery group. The gonadosonatic index (GSI) of females at 500 ng L−1 decreased significantly in another 60 d exposure. While the fry were maintained in dechlorinated tap water for 60 d, a significant decrease in female GSI was observed at 50 ng L−1 or above. An increased GSI was found in males in both continual exposure and water recovery groups at all E1 treatments. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that vitellogenin-I (Vtg-I) gene expressions in the female liver were significantly down-regulated at 50 ng L−1 in the continual exposure group, and at 500 ng L−1 in the water recovery group, while male Vtg-I genes were significantly up-regulated for all E1 treatments. In addition, all E1 treatments caused sex reversal of males. These results suggest that E1 at 5 ng L−1 or above have unrecoverable impacts on the gonadal growth and development of medaka, even if only early life stages were exposed to E1.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Visible markers for genotypic sex, if reliable, simplify assays because time-consuming PCR-based genotyping can be skipped. Here, we describe a line of Japanese medaka with a brain-expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene inserted near the sex-determining locus. When used with a white pigment cell marker, genotypic sex can be determined reliably as early as 3 days after fertilization (well before gonadal sex differentiation). No recombinants were found in more than 2000 progenies. We also introduced a strong ovarian GFP marker into the line with these genetic sex markers, so that phenotypic sex can also be determined reliably at 8 days after hatching. Well-known sex reversal protocols using exogenous steroid treatments of embryos were monitored by this transgenic line, demonstrating the line to be a useful tool for in vivo studies utilizing gonadal sex differentiation of the medaka, especially for screenings of potential estrogenic and androgenic EDCs.Crossing schemes for mapping the insertion site of the transgene and the results (Table S1), the raw data from the G7 faX and MC cross (Table S2), the raw data from the 42S-faX and MC cross (Table S3), the raw data from the sex reversal experiment (Table S4), and the time course of 42Sp50:EGFP expression after hatching (Figure S1).

Although EV is known as an estrogenic chemical, there is still a lack of data on its developmental and reproductive toxicities in fish following exposure to EV during embryo-larval-, juvenile- and adult-life stages in Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). At the early life stage, the fertilized eggs of medaka were exposed to 1, 10, 100 and 1000 ng/L EV for 15 days, and hatched larval fish were continually exposed to the same concentration range for an additional 15 days. The results showed that exposure to 10 ng/L or above resulted in adverse effects on hatchability and time to hatching, and the number of hatched females was twice that of males at 10 ng/L or above. When the hatched fish were continually exposed to 1, 10 and 100 ng/L of EV for another 40 days, the hepatosomatic index (HSI) was increased in both males and females, and the gonadosomatic index (GSI) was decreased in females, and increased in males. Sex reversal was found in fish exposed to 1 ng/L and above. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed that mRNA levels of estrogen receptor α (ER-α) and vitellogenin-I (VTG-I) in the liver of females were significantly down-regulated, while those of vitellogenin-I (VTG-I) in the liver of males were significantly up-regulated at all concentrations. These findings suggest that EV is a reproductive toxicant and estrogenic chemical in both male and female fish.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Species inhabiting heterogeneous environments tend to differ in competitive abilities depending on environmental stressors. Interactions between these factors can allow coexistence of competing species, which may be particularly important between invasive and native species. Here, we examine the effects of temperature on competitive interactions between invasive mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, and an endemic Iberian toothcarp, Aphanius iberus. We compare the tendency to approach heterospecifics and food capture rates between these two species, and examine differences between sexes and species in aggressive interactions, at three different temperatures (19, 24 and 29°C) in three laboratory experiments. Mosquitofish exhibit much more aggression than toothcarp. We show that mosquitofish have the capacity to competitively displace toothcarp through interference competition and this outcome is more likely at higher temperatures. We also show a reversal in the competitive hierarchy through reduced food capture rate by mosquitofish at lower temperatures and suggest that these two types of competition may act synergistically to deprive toothcarp of food at higher temperatures. Males of both species carry out more overtly aggressive acts than females, which is probably related to the marked sexual dimorphism and associated mating systems of these two species. Mosquitofish may thus impact heavily on toothcarp, and competition from mosquitofish, especially in warmer summer months, may lead to changes in abundance of the native species and displacement to non-preferred habitats. Globally increasing temperatures mean that highly invasive, warm-water mosquitofish may be able to colonize environments from which they are currently excluded through reduced physiological tolerance to low temperatures. Research into the effects of temperature on interactions between native and invasive species is thus of fundamental importance.Citation: Carmona-Catot G, Magellan K, García-Berthou E (2013) Temperature-Specific Competition between Invasive Mosquitofish and an Endangered Cyprinodontid Fish.

Species that inhabit spatially or temporally heterogeneous environments tend to have differing competitive abilities and varying tolerance for environmental stressors. Interactions between these factors can allow coexistence of competing species. In one scenario, for example, an inferior competitor may be excluded from part of its range, or for part of the time, by a competitively dominant species but be able to use other parts of its range, or more of its range at different times, through higher tolerance to an abiotic stress (e.g. [3], [4], [5]). In another scenario, a competitive reversal may occur whereby a competitively dominant species loses its advantage as conditions change along an environmental gradient and the previously subordinate species becomes dominant (e.g. [2], [6], [7]). Environmental gradients are particularly apparent in aquatic environments [2], [8], [9], which thus provide ideal situations in which to examine hypotheses concerning condition-specific competition. Several studies have investigated these phenomena in an array of taxa subject to various abiotic influences, including the effects of salinity on salt-marsh plants [6] and fish [1], hydroperiod on mosquitoes [7] and oysters [5], pH on amphibians [3], and temperature on stream fish [2], [4], [9].Condition-specific competition may be particularly important when considering invasive species [5], [7], [10] and the dependence of competitive interactions between native and exotic species on temperature is receiving increasing interest [11], [12], [13], [14]. Temperature is a key factor for poikilothermic organisms and in freshwater and estuarine ecosystems temperature is often considered to be one of the dominant abiotic factors regulating interspecific competition [14], [15]. Moreover, growing concern regarding globally increasing temperatures means that research into the effects of temperature is of fundamental importance. In the Mediterranean region, for example, climate change models predict higher annual temperatures and longer droughts [16]. Interannual fluctuations are also expected to be more common, which would result in more exceptionally high temperature events [16]. In addition, continuing habitat alterations may lead to further increases in stream temperatures (e.g. [17]). These factors combined are likely to contribute to an expansion in range and population size of introduced warmwater fishes, and therefore increase predation rates or competitive effects on native species with preferences for cool water [18].The eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, is a warmwater poeciliid fish native to the United States [19]. Since its introduction to Europe in 1921, G. holbrooki has established stable populations in most Mediterranean countries [20], [21]. However, G. holbrooki has not invaded northern Europe, probably because of reduced physiological tolerance, and therefore decreased competitive advantage, at lower temperatures (e.g. [20], [22]). Competition from mosquitofish has likely caused the displacement of several Mediterranean fish species, in particular cyprinodontiforms, from much of their native range [23], [24], [25]. For example, the Iberian toothcarp (Aphanius iberus), a cyprinodontid fish endemic to the Iberian Peninsula, originally occupied most of the Alt Empordà wetlands (NE Spain). Now only isolated populations remain while most of the coastal lagoons, ditches and rivers are inhabited by introduced mosquitofish [26]. From the original 38 Mediterranean populations, 15 are extinct [27] and the toothcarp is listed as Endangered (EN A2ce) under the IUCN Red List, and protected by a number of legislative frameworks such as the Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats [28].The objective of this study is to examine the role of water temperature in determining the outcome of interspecific competition between invasive mosquitofish and native toothcarp. As mosquitofish are known to be aggressive [19], we predicted that they would exhibit both greater aggression and initiate more encounters, and that they would restrict toothcarp’s access to food. However, as mosquitofish are a warmwater species [19] we further predicted that any competitive advantage would be more evident at warmer temperatures, while at lower temperatures toothcarp would be able to benefit from G. holbrooki’s reduced competitive ability, thus demonstrating condition-specific competition. Finally, as both of these species show marked sexual dimorphism [19], [29] and males are generally more aggressive intraspecifically [30] but not always interspecifically (e.g. [31]), we expected sexual differences in aggressiveness.All work was performed in compliance with Spanish laws of animal care and experimentation. The experiments were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Girona.Fish used in our experiment were captured using dip nets in September 2011 with scientific permits issued by the relevant authority (Generalitat de Catalunya, Direcció General del Medi Natural i Biodiversitat). Adult mosquitofish came from the Ter, Fluvià and Muga rivers near Girona, Spain, and toothcarp from Fra Ramon lagoon, Baix Empordà salt marshes, Spain [19]. About 200 fish of each species were transported to the laboratory and evenly distributed without mixing species in twelve 60 L species-specific stock aquaria (61 × 31 × 33 cm) containing a gravel substrate, conditioned water, and a filtered air supply. Mosquitofish from all three rivers were housed together. Aquaria were illuminated with 6 W bulbs and maintained at a constant photoperiod (12∶12 h light:dark cycle). The temperature was maintained at 24°C and fish were fed to satiation twice daily with commercial food flakes and frozen bloodworms (Chironomus spp.). Fish were allowed to adapt to laboratory conditions for at least four weeks prior to the start of temperature acclimation.The temperature acclimation protocol was conducted in the same 12 aquaria, two for each species at each temperature, and consisted of the progressive adjustment of temperature using aquarium heaters until the three experimental temperatures (19, 24 and 29, ±0.2°C) were reached. These temperatures were selected because they are typical of the range of midsummer water temperatures found in Iberian coastal lagoons (e.g. [32]). Temperature was measured using digital thermometers placed inside the aquaria. After five days, all fish were at the necessary experimental temperature and were maintained at these conditions for at least 14 days before the start of observations. Mortality during acclimation was low (less than 5%) and only one fish died during observations. This trial was restarted after the fish was replaced. Fish acclimated to a specific temperature treatment were maintained at that temperature throughout the experimental period.Observations were conducted in three 26 L aquaria (45 × 28 × 22 cm) also maintained at 19, 24 and 29°C respectively. Aquaria contained 2 cm of gravel substrate, were filled to a depth of 20 cm with conditioned water and were illuminated by 6 W lights. Dark plastic was attached to the back and sides of the aquaria to minimize disturbance. A removable, transparent methacrylate wall pierced with small holes (216 holes in 12 columns) divided each aquarium into two sides. During the afternoon before observations, fish were placed in the experimental aquaria at the same temperature as their respective acclimation temperatures. Two mosquitofish (visually size matched) of the same sex (50% of trials with males and 50% with females) were placed on one side of the methacrylate divider. Same sex mosquitofish were used to reduce the incentive for male-male competition over females. One toothcarp was randomly selected and its pair was then size matched; both fish were placed on the other side of the divider. The side for each species was swapped in successive trials. The methacrylate divider allowed the two species to visually and chemically respond to each other while preventing physical contact. Fish were fed to satiation with frozen bloodworms and uneaten prey were removed from the experimental aquaria. No food was provided to the experimental fish for at least 20 hours before observations. The series of experimental tests (i.e. Test 1, Test 2 and Test 3) were conducted sequentially the following day. To ensure that individual fish were used only once during the experiments, they were placed into post-experimental aquaria maintained at their specific acclimation temperature after the trials. Each of the three temperature treatments (19, 24 and 29°C) had 30 replicates (i.e. a total of 90 replicates with 360 different fish). All trials were videotaped (two sample videos at contrasting temperatures are provided in Movie S1 and Movie S2).In test 1, we examined the tendency for mosquitofish and toothcarp to investigate and approach heterospecifics as a function of temperature. Observations began when the methacrylate divider was gently raised to the surface. Every care was taken to avoid disturbing the fish. We recorded the species and the time taken for the first fish to cross to the other side of the aquarium (specifically when the head or tail crossed the center line) and for the first fish to approach within one body length of the other species.In test 2, following test 1, we studied the effects of temperature and sex on the agonistic interactions between mosquitofish and toothcarp. We waited five minutes after we raised the methacrylate divider to ensure that all fish were behaving normally and then conducted 10-minute observations recording the number of orientations (fish orienting itself and swimming towards another fish), nips (one fish attempts or succeeds at biting another) and chases (rapid chase of one fish by another). We conducted focal watches of one randomly selected fish per species sequentially, recording the sex of the fish observed for each species.Test 3 immediately followed test 2. Here we assessed the effects of temperature on food competition between toothcarp and mosquitofish. Four bloodworms were placed at 10 cm intervals on a thin piece of wire and were carefully released at the water surface. Bloodworms were used because they are common prey items in the diet of the two species [33], [34]. We recorded the time taken to eat the first prey item and the species that consumed each of the four prey items. Any bloodworms that remained after five minutes were recorded as uneaten.To assess the tendency for toothcarp and mosquitofish to investigate and approach conspecifics we used generalized linear models (GLMs) in a factorial design with two categorical factors, temperature and species. To analyze the proportion of each species over all trials for each temperature that were first to carry out these behaviors we used separate χ2 tests for each variable. For the agonistic variables we used separate GLMs for each species and each variable (orientations, nips and chases) with two categorical factors, temperature and sex. For the last experiment, we also used separate analyses for each species and GLMs for the proportion of prey eaten and the time taken to capture the first prey item with temperature as the single factor. In GLMs, we always used Poisson errors and log-link functions for count variables (i.e. number of nips, chases, and orientations), normal distributions and identity-link functions for time variables and binomial errors and logit-link functions for the proportion of prey eaten. Finally, we conducted two χ2 tests to assess the difference in the proportion of trials in which each species was the first to capture a prey item. First we included the uneaten prey items and second this category was excluded. All statistical analyses were conducted using the software SPSS 15.In test 1, the time taken for the first fish to cross the center line of the aquarium (GLM χ2 = 19.4, d.f. = 2, P<0.001) and the time taken for the first fish to approach within one body length of a heterospecific (GLM χ2 = 13.5, d.f. = 2, P = 0.001) both decreased significantly with increasing temperature (Figure 1). However, there was no difference between species in the time taken to carry out either of these behaviors (cross: GLM χ2 = 2.43, d.f. = 1, P = 0.119; approach: GLM χ2 = 0.086, d.f. = 1, P = 0.769), nor were the interactions significant (cross: GLM χ2 = 4.51, d.f. = 2, P = 0.105; approach: GLM χ2 = 4.86, d.f. = 2, P = 0.088). For the proportion of trials in which each species was the first to carry out these behaviors, toothcarp both crossed the center line first and approached a heterospecific first more often at 19°C, while this response was reversed at higher temperatures (cross: χ2 = 8.30, d.f. = 2, P = 0.016; 19°C, 22 toothcarp:8 mosquitofish, 24°C, 15∶15, 29°C, 12∶20; approach: χ2 = 7.23, d.f. = 2, P = 0.027; 19°C, 20∶10, 24°C, 11∶19, 29°C, 11∶19).Means and SE (error bar) are shown.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0054734.g001In test 2, mosquitofish exhibited much more aggression than toothcarp, with the majority of aggressive behavior being performed by mosquitofish towards toothcarp (84.02%), whereas only 15.98% was conducted by toothcarp towards mosquitofish. Aggression in both species varied significantly across temperatures (Table 1), with both species showing increased aggression with increasing temperature (Figure 2). There was also a significant difference between the sexes (Table 1). Males of both species exhibited more of all three of the recorded aggressive behaviors than females. Moreover, orientations appear to be the preferred behavior for females while males carried out relatively more nips to the extent that at the highest temperature the frequency of nips equaled or exceeded that of the other behaviors (Figure 2). Temperature × sex interactions were significant for almost all the behavioral variables (Table 1), with the exception of chases performed by toothcarp as female toothcarp did not carry out this behavior. Particularly, toothcarp males changed their preferred behavior type at 29°C from orientations to nips and particularly striking were the differing effects of temperature on male and female mosquitofish. Males exhibited the greatest increase in behaviors performed between 19 and 24°C while for females the major increase in behavior occurred at a higher temperature, between 24 and 29°C (Figure 2).Means and SE (error bar) are shown. Note the different scales on the y-axis for each species.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0054734.g002https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0054734.t001In test 3 the proportion of prey items captured increased with temperature for both species. However, this relationship was significant only for mosquitofish (mosquitofish: GLM χ2 = 48.2, d.f. = 2, P<0.001; toothcarp: GLM χ2 = 3.05, d.f. = 2, P = 0.218; Figure 3). The time required to capture the first prey item decreased substantially between the lowest and highest temperatures (19°C: 29.9±57.1 s, 24°C: 56.2±83.4 s, 29°C: 8.6±15.4 s; mean ± s.d.) although this relationship was not straightforward and was only marginally significant (GLM χ2 = 5.92, d.f. = 2, P = 0.052). There was no significant difference between species (GLM χ2 = 3.41, d.f. = 1, P = 0.52; toothcarp: 19.0±36.9 s; mosquitofish: 42.8±76.5 s; mean ± s.d.) nor a significant interaction (GLM χ2 = 0.236, d.f. = 2, P = 0.89). When all trials at each temperature were considered together, at 19°C toothcarp captured the first prey item significantly more often than mosquitofish but this relationship was reversed for 24 and 29°C (χ2 = 25.2, d.f. = 4, P<0.001). However, this result was mainly due to the inclusion of uneaten prey items (toothcarp:mosquitofish:uneaten; 19°C, 13∶6:11; 24°C, 11∶18:1; 29°C, 13∶17:0). When this variable was removed the relationship between species and temperature was no longer significant (χ2 = 4.61, d.f. = 2, P = 0.11).Means and SE (error bar) are shown. Note that the totals for both species for 19 and 24°C do not equal 100%. This reflects the prey that remained uneaten.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0054734.g003This study provides evidence for condition-specific competition, both through interference and exploitation, between eastern mosquitofish and Iberian toothcarp, via temperature-mediated changes in competitive abilities. Mosquitofish carried out close to five times as many aggressive acts as toothcarp, and while both species exhibited increased aggression at higher temperatures, this increase was considerably greater for mosquitofish than for toothcarp. Mosquitofish thus have the potential to competitively displace toothcarp through interference competition, and the strength of this interaction is likely to increase at higher water temperatures. Increased aggression at higher temperatures has been proposed as a major factor explaining the relative distribution of several fish species along longitudinal stream gradients [2], [4], [9]. For example, brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) were competitively dominant over cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) at higher temperatures (20 versus 10°C), which was related to separation of these species into warmer, downstream (brook trout) and cooler, upstream (cutthroat trout) stretches of river [4]. In another study, brook trout were themselves subject to competitive exclusion by creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) at a slightly higher temperature (22°C) resulting in similar upstream-downstream species distributions [2]. In our study, temperature variation occurs more over a temporal rather than spatial scale, though microhabitat segregation of the two species through competitive interactions is also likely.The time taken for the fish to both approach a heterospecific and to cross the center line of the experimental aquaria decreased with increasing temperatures although there were no differences between species. However, the frequency with which toothcarp were the first to cross the center line and approach a heterospecific was greater at 19°C, while at higher temperatures this situation was reversed and mosquitofish predominated. This seems to indicate a competitive reversal with toothcarp dominating at lower temperatures and mosquitofish superior at higher temperatures. However, the function of this approach behavior must be taken into consideration. The assumption that approaching a heterospecific is a prelude to attacking that individual is just one of a number of possibilities. For example, closer contact may be necessary to inspect a potential predator and hence assess the degree of threat [35], [36]. Alternatively, approaching other individuals may simply be a result of a predisposition for schooling behavior, as mixed species shoals are not uncommon [37], [38]. Whatever the purpose of this behavior, it is clear that toothcarp exhibited increased activity relative to mosquitofish at lower temperatures.Temperature also influenced the potential for exploitative competition. The time taken to capture the first prey item decreased and the proportion of prey items captured by both species increased, with increasing temperature. However, there was no difference between species in capture time and the proportional increase in prey capture was significant only for mosquitofish. Furthermore, while toothcarp captured the first prey item more often at 19°C, this situation was reversed at 24 and 29°C, providing another example of potential competitive reversal. This situation relates to varying total food consumption by both species. Toothcarp captured the first food item with approximately the same frequency at all temperatures while mosquitofish increased their capture frequency at higher temperatures. Therefore, rather than toothcarp being more dominant at lower temperatures, they appear to benefit from reduced exploitative competition from mosquitofish. Release from dominance by a competitively superior species appears to be a common factor in competitive reversal. For example, in the brook trout – cutthroat trout system outlined above both species were nearly equal competitors at 10°C with brook trout becoming dominant only at the higher temperature [4]. A parallel pattern was shown in another study with the white-spotted char (Salvelinus leucomaenis) and the Dolly Varden char (S. malma) foraging equally well at lower temperatures but the former becoming dominant at a higher temperature [9]. A final consideration is that both these forms of competition, exploitative and interference, may be operating concurrently as in aggression to defend a food resource [39], [40]. Thus at higher temperatures mosquitofish have the capacity to restrict toothcarp access to food through exploitative competition and if food was limited, as is often the case, mosquitofish are likely to outcompete toothcarp through interference competition as well.While aggression in the laboratory does not necessary imply competition in nature, in this case it is likely. Although interference competition is often more influential and clearer than exploitative competition [41], both types of competition can occur concurrently and interactively and may be difficult to distinguish [42]. G. affinis and G. holbrooki are well known to produce severe fin damage through nips, which can result in several adverse effects on recipient species [43], [44]. For example, swimming performance is likely to be reduced with potential consequent reduction in reproductive success and increased predation risk. Damage is costly in terms of regeneration effort and can increase susceptibility to disease [45], [46]. Fin damage can also result in changes in behaviour and prey consumption by the subordinate species [44], [47]. In the current study, the increase in aggression together with greater food capture efficiency shown by mosquitofish at higher temperatures indicates that mosquitofish have the capacity to outcompete toothcarp. Moreover, mosquitofish now dominate many of the habitats that were previously occupied by toothcarp [26] and competition is one of the likely mechanisms by which this has occurred.There was a difference between males and females of both species in both the amount and type of behavior carried out, and for mosquitofish the temperature at which differences became apparent. Males of both species exhibited much more aggression than females. Moreover, females appear to prefer to engage in orientation behavior while males carry out more nips, particularly at higher temperatures, which is arguably a more aggressive behavior than merely observing another fish. These behavioral differences between sexes are likely to be associated with other differences. For example, in many animals, including fish, larger individuals initiate and receive less aggression [48], [49]. Both species in this study showed a marked sexual dimorphism with larger females and smaller males [19], [29] so this may account for some of the observed difference. In addition, females tend to be more sociable and engage in more shoaling than males [50], an activity incompatible with a high intensity of aggression. Finally, differences in aggression between the sexes may be an indirect consequence of the mating behaviors of these species [50]. Mating in mosquitofish is characterized by male coercion of females via sneaky mating, in which males attempt to insert their intromittent organ into the female’s genital opening by force and males compete aggressively for access to females [51], [52]. While reproductive behavior in toothcarp is less well studied, males do court females and will chase away rival males [53]. This may result in male predisposition for aggression [50], which is utilized to the detriment of heterospecifics. Because the temperatures used in this study were typical of the breeding season of both these species [54], [55], this effect may be intensified. Although male and female mosquitofish were not tested together in this study, behavior related to reproduction is likely to persist. An interesting result from this study is that male mosquitofish increased their level of aggression at 24°C, while females did not show a similar increase until 29°C. Males show a peak plateau in mating behavior in a comparable temperature range [56] though mating behavior was not quantified in our study. It also may be that males prefer cooler temperatures than females as is the case in two closely related species, Poecilia sphenops [57] and Poecilia reticulata [58]. Whatever the cause, for females their peak of maximum activity is either shifted to higher temperatures or is narrower compared to males, a factor which may influence the relative impact of males and females on toothcarp.Temperature may have other effects that can interactively influence aggression. For example, the metabolic rate of ectotherms increases with increasing temperature (e.g. [59]), facilitating increased aggression. However, aggression itself is energetically costly [60] increasing metabolic rate still further, which probably accounts for the rise in food consumption at higher temperatures observed in this study. Another interacting factor is swimming speed which also increases with increasing temperature (e.g. [56]), which again will facilitate intensified aggression and again increase metabolic rate. In addition to these immediate effects, temperature variation may have long term consequences. In this study, fish were allowed to acclimate for four weeks. A longer duration of acclimation, can affect for example growth rate [47] and size at maturity [61]. Finally, temperature itself may interact with other factors, such as water velocity [62] and salinity [25] to influence aggressive activity.We have shown here that temperature-specific competition may facilitate coexistence of native species with invasive mosquitofish. Mosquitofish have been introduced worldwide [61], [63] with far reaching effects on native species (reviewed in [64]) and are considered one of the 100 worst invasive species [65]. Therefore, any factor that may aid in ameliorating their effects should be investigated. The influence of temperature on interactions with mosquitofish has been examined in relation to several native species. For example, G. holbrooki aggression towards two Iberian toothcarp species (A. iberus and Valencia hispanica) increased at higher temperatures [23] and increased aggression with temperature has been shown by the closely related G. affinis towards Galaxias maculatus in New Zealand [43] and the least chub, Iothichthys phlegethontis in the USA [31], with effects on the survival of these native fish. In the current study, mosquitofish aggression may have immediate, medium and longer term consequences for toothcarp. In addition to disrupting normal conspecific interactions, mosquitofish can cause considerable fin damage [43], [44] and mortality, especially of juveniles [23], [43]. Injury, along with decreased food intake [24] and reduced growth rates [47] can lead to increased stress and susceptibility to illness [45], [46]. The temperatures used in this study are typical of breeding season temperatures for toothcarp, which is characterized by early offspring that can mature enough to breed later in the summer and late offspring that may overwinter and breed the following year [55]. Restriction of food and disruption of conspecific interactions is likely to reduce the breeding success of early offspring and overwinter survival of poor condition, late offspring could also be reduced. This in turn could result in changes in population demographics (e.g. [31]) through a decline in population density or a shift in breeding season and to the displacement of native species to non-preferred habitats (e.g. [43]). Climate change implies that investigating these types of temperature-mediated interactions between invasive and native species will be increasingly critical to aid in conservation efforts.Movie showing an experimental trial at 29°C.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0054734.s001(MP4)Movie showing an experimental trial at 19°C.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0054734.s002(MP4)We gratefully thank Carles Alcaraz, Enric Aparicio, Bruce Hammock and Irene Ylla for their helpful comments, advice and help, and Esther Pérez for assistance with the experiments.

In fish, a multitude of effects from environmental estrogens have been observed including altered courting behavior and fertility, sex reversal, and gonadal histopathology. However, few studies in fish assess the impacts of estrogenic exposure on a physiological endpoint, such as reproduction, as well as the associated morphologic response and underlying global gene expression changes. This study assessed the implications of a 14 day sub-chronic exposure of ethinylestradiol (EE2; 1.0 or 10.0 µg/L EE2) on male medaka fertility, testicular histology and testicular gene expression. The findings demonstrate that a 14 day exposure to EE2 induced impaired male reproductive capacity and time- and dose-dependent alterations in testicular morphology and gene expression. The average fertilization rate/day following the exposure for control, 1.0 and 10.0 µg/L EE2 was 91.3% (±4.4), 62.8% (±8.3) and 28.8% (±5.8), respectively. The testicular morphologic alterations included increased germ cell apoptosis, decreased germinal epithelium and thickening of the interstitium. These changes were highly associated with testicular gene expression changes using a medaka-specific microarray. A pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes emphasized genes and pathways associated with apoptosis, cell cycle and proliferation, collagen production/extracellular matrix organization, hormone signaling, male reproduction and protein ubiquitination among others. These findings highlight the importance of anchoring global gonadal gene expression changes with morphology and ultimately with tissue/organ function.Citation: Miller HD, Clark BW, Hinton DE, Whitehead A, Martin S, Kwok KW, et al.

Because the eventual sink for many EDCs is the aquatic medium, fish have been frequently studied. Multiple wild fish populations with altered gonads, in particular testicular oocytes, have been observed around the world including: roach (Rutilus rutilus), gudgeon (Gobio gobio) and flounder (Platichthys flesus) from rivers in the United Kingdom, barbel (Barbus plebejus) from Italy, grey mullet (Mugil cephalus) in coastal waters of Japan and Korea, shovelnose sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus platyornchus) from the Mississippi River and bass species from rivers within the United States [3]–[9]. Many of these gonadal alterations have been attributed to EDC exposures, which are often associated with agricultural practices and municipal effluents. In male fish exposed to estrogenic EDCs, gene expression is altered and reproductive physiology and morphology are subsequently impacted as evidenced by: synthesis of the yolk protein, vitellogenin; altered spermatogenesis; testicular fibrosis; development of testicular oocytes; decreased sperm counts and eventually reduced fertility [7], [10]–[13].Ethinylestradiol (EE2), the synthetic estrogen in oral contraceptives, is of particular interest from an environmental standpoint due to its high estrogenic potency and its detection in aquatic systems receiving sewage treatment water [14]–[18]. A 7-year study in northwestern Ontario, Canada in which an entire lake was regularly dosed with environmentally relevant concentrations of EE2 (4.8–6.1 ng/L) for three years demonstrated impaired spermatogenesis and testicular oocytes in both pearl dace (Margariscus margarita) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) populations [19], [20]. Furthermore, there was a collapse of the fathead minnow population after the second year due to loss of young-of-the-year individuals [19].Studies on wild roach (Rutilus rutilus) downstream of wastewater treatment facilities in the United Kingdom found vitellogenin induction and testicular oocytes in males [7]. Subsequent laboratory studies of roach to environmentally relevant EE2 concentrations found strong effects on male gonadal development and reproduction [21], [22]. Laboratory studies of model fish, such as zebrafish (Danio rerio) and medaka (Oryzias latipes), have also demonstrated decreased reproductive capacity following EE2 exposure [23], [24].The endocrine system is a complex, integrated system with the ability to influence expression of a wide range of genes. Proper steroid hormone signaling and reproduction function is dependent on the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. EDCs can influence multiple points within the HPG axis [25]. Surprisingly, few studies have assessed global gonadal gene expression changes associated with EE2 exposure in fish. The majority of studies, for example, have targeted specific genes involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis or known estrogen-responsive genes [11], [12], [23], [26]. Hirakawa et al. [27] assessed testicular gene expression in EE2 exposed adult medaka with a strong emphasis on genes associated with testicular oocytes. Since testicular oocytes are one of the traits often used as indicators of chronic estrogen exposure in fish, this study identified associated gene expression profiles of testicular oocytes as potential biomarkers. In this study, we focused on sub-chronic testicular gene expression events and associated morphological changes that may occur prior to formation of ovo-testis including increased germ cell apoptosis, decreased germinal epithelium and thickening of the interstitium.The aim of this study was to further understand the molecular mechanisms of estrogen induced toxicity by linking testicular gene expression pathways with altered testicular morphology and reproductive function. To achieve this aim, we used a sub-chronic 14 day exposure to EE2 as our treatment regimen and followed with three assessments: (1) a breeding study to assess the reproductive effect of a 14 day EE2 exposure on the male fish; (2) a histological examination of the testis on days 1, 7 and 14 of the EE2 exposure and following a post exposure 14 day depuration period; and (3) testicular gene expression analysis through a medaka specific microarray on days 1, 7 and day 14 of the EE2 exposure.During the 12 day pre-exposure period, breeding groups consisting of one male and three females were established and monitored daily for fecundity and fertility. All groups were reproductively active with no statistically significant difference in daily fecundity or fertility (p>0.05) (Figures 1 and 2). Upon removal of males from the breeding group (for male-only exposure to EE2), residual egg production in females was sporadic and greatly reduced. Fertilization of eggs ceased 8 days following removal of males indicating residual sperm were retained in the breeding chambers following removal of males (Figure 2).No statistical difference was found during the pre-exposure period. One-way ANOVA of the post-exposure time period found significant differences between the control and treatment groups. Different letters indicate statistical difference in the post-exposure time period (p<0.05).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052479.g001Dashed lines indicate the mean percentage fertilized during the 20-day post-exposure period for each treatment. Different letters indicate a statistical difference (p<0.05).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052479.g002Males were exposed to DMSO (control), 1.0 µg/L EE2 or 10.0 µg/L EE2 for 14 days. Following the male exposure and the designed return of males to their respective breeding chambers, there was a significant decrease in fecundity (the total number of eggs/day) in both EE2 treatments. While control beakers averaged 54.4 (±6.4) eggs/day (n = 6), the 1.0 (n = 6) and 10.0 (n = 7) µg/L EE2 beakers averaged 29.2 (±6.9) and 19.7 (±3.8) total eggs/day respectively (Figure 1). Both the 1.0 and 10.0 µg/L EE2 treatments were significantly different from control (p<0.05) but not from each other (p = 0.16). The fertilization rate of eggs laid/day exhibited a significant concentration response. The average percent of eggs fertilized/day for control, 1.0 and 10.0 µg/L EE2 was 91.3% (±4.4), 62.8% (±8.3) and 28.8% (±5.8), respectively (Figure 2). The 1.0 µg/L EE2 treatment was significantly different from control and the 10.0 µg/L EE2 treatment was significantly different from both control and 1.0 µg/L EE2 treatment. At the end of the post-exposure breeding period fertilization rates and fecundity remained at decreased levels suggesting recovery of reproductive capacity was not achieved during the 20 day time frame of our post exposure reproductive study.The following cohorts of fish were assessed histologically: control non-breeding males; exposed non-breeding males on days 1, 7 and 14 of EE2 exposure; exposed non-breeding males allowed to recover for 14 days post exposure; control breeding males and exposed breeding males from the reproduction experiment.Histological assessment of control medaka (Figure 3A and B) demonstrates that the testis is bilobed with a restricted spermatogonial lobular structure composed of lobules that end blindly at the periphery of the organ. This is similar to testicular organization of medaka reported in the literature [28]–[31]. In fish with this testicular architecture, spermatogonia are only present at the periphery of the lobule. Based on our results and those described by others, Sertoli cells surround individual spermatogonia forming an isogenic cyst that undergoes synchronized development through spermatogenesis [31]–[34]. Further analysis revealed that the testis is divided into two compartments: the lobular compartment, consisting of germ cells and Sertoli cells, and an interstitial compartment, comprised of Leydig cells, peritubular myoid cells, connective tissue, efferent duct epithelial cells, endothelium of blood vessels and circulating blood cells [29], [31], [33]–[36].A: Transverse section of testis showing both lobes joined by the central efferent duct. Spermatogonial germ cells are at periphery of the organ. B: A longitudinal section of a DMSO control animal showing normal testicular morphology. Dark basophilic staining central region is comprised of spermatozoa filling lumen of efferent duct. As in A (above) spermatogonial cells are restricted to the periphery of the organ. Between the periphery and the CED various stages of spermatogenesis are encountered. C: Animal exposed to 1.0 µg/L EE2 for 7 days. When interstitium of animals from this group were compared to controls only one animal showed enhanced thickening of the interstitium and this was limited in extent. D: Animal exposed to 10.0 µg/L EE2 for 7 days. Thickened interstitium was apparent in a zone half way between the periphery and the CED. E: Animal exposed to 1.0 µg/L EE2 for 14 days. At this time, moderate thickening of the interstitium and increased area of clear space devoid of germ cells characterized the lobular lumen. There is a decrease in the proportion of intermediate staged germ cells as evident by the smaller area occupied by these cells (i.e. spermatocytes and spermatids) and a general decrease in germinal epithelium. F: Animal exposed to 10.0 µg/L EE2 for 14 days has a severe thickening of the interstitium, increased vacuolization, and an overall decrease in germinal epithelium. G: Animal exposed to 1.0 µg/L EE2 for 14 days followed by 14 days of recovery showed return toward control morphology. The thickening of the interstitium has diminished compared to E or F and there is an abundance of intermediate stage germ cells indicating active spermatogenesis. The CED does not have many spermatozoa but there are spermatids and spermatozoa in the efferent duct system preparing to enter the central duct. H: Animal exposed to 10.0 µg/L EE2 for 14 days followed by 14 days of recovery. There is continued thickening of the interstitium and significantly altered spermatogenesis. Only mature sperm and a few spermatogonia are present but intermediate stages of germ cells are absent or greatly reduced indicating little active spermatogenesis. There is also eosinophilic change in the interstitium.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052479.g003Testicular interstitium stained with a pronounced eosinophilia while germinal epithelium showed more prominent basophilic staining. As is shown in Figure 3A and B, the mature spermatozoa showed greatest amount of basophilia seen particularly well in the central efferent duct. Lumens of the lobules were nearly completely filled with rounded cells whose morphology was consistent with germinal epithelium. As the lobular lumens were followed centrally, they were occupied by cells whose nuclei stained extremely basophilic (i.e., dark purple). Curvy elongated eosinophilic structures marked the interstitium. This material provided sufficient resolution to identify specific compartments and cell types and spermatogenic stages in the testis.Animals were exposed to DMSO (control), 1.0 µg/L EE2, and 10.0 µg/L EE2 for 14 days and sampled for histology on exposure days 1, 7 and 14. Analysis demonstrated both time- and concentration-dependent alterations in testicular structure including: thickening of the interstitial tissue, increased apoptosis of germ cells, and altered spermatogenesis as evidenced by decreased proportion of spermatocytes and spermatids in germinal epithelium (Figure 3C–F). Apoptotic germ cells were identified by their shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and fragmentation into spherical, membrane-bound bodies. The latter are often phagocytized by neighboring cells as previously described [37]. No change in testicular morphology was observed on day 1 of exposure. On exposure day 7, one individual from 1.0 µg/L EE2 treatment (n = 3) exhibited thickening of the interstitial tissue and decreased spermatozoa. The 10.0 µg/L EE2 treatment (n = 3) after 7 days of exposure exhibited a similar thickening of the interstitial tissue as well as increased apoptosis of spermatocytes and spermatids (Figure 3D). On day 14 of exposure, all individuals in the 1.0 µg/L EE2 treatment (n = 3) exhibited thickening of interstitial tissue and increased apoptotic spermatocytes and spermatids. In addition, one replicate also displayed a decrease in spermatozoa (Figure 3E). The 10.0 µg/L EE2 treatment (n = 3) on exposure day 14 displayed increased thickening of the interstitial tissue as well as altered spermatogenesis and a loss of germinal epithelium (Figure 3F).Following the 14 day EE2 exposure, male fish were allowed to recover for an additional 14 day depuration (recovery) period. Individuals exposed to 1.0 µg/L EE2 (n = 3) exhibited signs of recovery following the depuration period (Figure 3G). Two of these replicates had an increased proportion of spermatocytes with concomitant decreased proportion of spermatozoa, indicative of initial resumption of spermatogenesis. However, the thickened interstitium persisted. The third replicate showed presence of testicular oocytes, thickened interstitium and many spermatozoa. Following 14 day depuration, individuals exposed to 10.0 µg/L EE2 exhibited continued thickening of interstitial tissue, eosinophilic change in the interstitium (likely proteinaceous fluid), altered spermatogenesis, and a decrease in germinal epithelium (Figure 3H). Testicular oocytes were observed in one of the 10.0 µg/L EE2 replicates.An assessment of the testicular morphology of EE2 treated breeding males following the reproductive assessment demonstrated alterations similar to those of testes from the non-breeding males on day 14 of exposure. In some instances, however, there was further degeneration of the testis of the breeding males versus the testis of non-breeding males immediately following the 14 day EE2 exposure. The testis from a single control breeding male contained testicular oocytes, karyomegalic germ cells, and disorganized lobular space. While spermatogenesis was occurring in this animal (i.e., spermatozoa were present), the altered morphology and general disorganization of the lobular space was significant. All other controls appeared normal. Male fish exposed to the 1.0 µg/L EE2 treatment (14 days, n = 4) followed by 20 days of breeding had altered germ cell epithelium and mild to severe thickening of the interstitium compared to controls (n = 5). This ranged from an increase in intermediate stage germ cells (spermatocytes and spermatids) and a decrease in spermatozoa associated with mild to moderate thickening of the interstitium to a severe loss of germ cell epithelium which was associated with maximal thickening of the interstitium (Figures 4B&C). Testicular oocytes and karyomegalic germ cells were found in three of the four replicates. The gonad without testicular oocytes had severe depletion of the germ cell epithelium and severe thickening of the interstitium. Male fish exposed to the 10.0 µg/L EE2 treatment (14 days, n = 6) followed by 20 days of breeding exhibited more pronounced alterations than did those of the 1.0 µg/L EE2 treated males. All animals had a moderate to severe thickening of the interstitium, which was also associated with a significant loss of germ cell epithelium (Figures 4D&E). Testicular oocytes and karyomegalic germ cells were present in four of the six gonads assessed. As seen in the 1.0 µg/L EE2 treated breeding males, gonads without testicular oocytes had severe thickening of the interstitium and significant loss of germ cell epithelium.A: DMSO control male. B: Male exposed to 1.0 µg/L EE2. There is thickening of the interstitium, an increase in proportion of spermatocytes, minimal spermatozoa. C: Male exposed to 1.0 µg/L EE2. This organ has severe thickening of the interstitium with a focal area of basophilic cells center of field and a severe decrease in germinal epithelium. D: Male exposed to 10.0 µg/L EE2. Severe thickening of interstitium and severe loss of germinal epithelium are. There are, however, spermatocytes and spermatids present suggesting active spermatogenesis. E: Male exposed to 10.0 µg/L EE2. There is severe thickening of the interstitium with loss of germinal epithelium.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052479.g004Testes were sampled on days 1, 7 and 14 of exposure for gene expression analysis. Significant differences in gene expression were observed between control and treatment groups at all sampling time-points. Analysis of gene expression data for 1.0 µg/L EE2 and 10.0 µg/L EE2 treatments on days 1, 7, and 14 of exposure demonstrated time- and concentration-dependent alterations. Time and concentration response trends were evident in both principle components analysis (PCA) (Figure 5) and hierarchical clustering (Figure 6). Assessment of principal components demonstrated a clear temporal trend as well as a concentration-dependent trend (Figure 5). The first principal component accounted for 47.7% of the data variability and was largely influenced by the strong temporal response in each EE2 treatment. After considering the temporal contribution to the variation in gene expression data, the second (16.3%) and third (13.8%) principal components appeared to be influenced by concentration accounting for a combined 77.8% of the total data variability. Evident in both PCA and hierarchical clustering, gene expression alterations on days 1 and 7 appeared more similar than gene expression changes on day 14.The first principal component accounted for 47.7% of the data variability and was largely influenced by the strong temporal response in each EE2 treatment. The second (16.3%) and third (13.8%) principal components appeared to be influenced by dose accounting for a combined 77.8% of the total data variability.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052479.g005A temporal trend is clearly observed. The same day sampling points cluster together with day 14 being the most distinct from day 1 and 7.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052479.g006Examination of data on a gene by gene basis relative to same day control demonstrates both a time- and concentration-dependence regarding the number of significant genes with the least number of significant transcripts expressed in the 1.0 µg/L EE2 treatment on day 1 and the most in the 10.0 µg/L EE2 treatment on day 14. On day 1 of exposure there were 198 and 819 significant transcripts differentially expressed in 1.0 µg/L EE2 and 10.0 µg/L EE2 treatments respectively (Figure 7A and B). Of these responses 87 of the 198 transcripts were unique in the 1.0 µg/L EE2 treatment and 448 of the 819 transcripts were unique in the 10.0 µg/L treatment. Similar patterns were observed for days 7 and 14 with 391 total transcripts in the 1.0 µg/L EE2 treatment on day 7 (200 unique), and 2365 transcripts in 1.0 µg/L EE2 treatment on day 14 (2141 unique) (Figure 7A). The 10.0 µg/L EE2 treatment on day 7 had 792 total transcripts (235 unique) and day 14 had 5306 total transcripts (4546 unique) (Figure 7B). Of the significantly expressed transcripts, there were 54 genes common to all sampling days (1, 7 and 14) in the 1.0 µg/L EE2 treatment (Figure 7A) and 92 common genes expressed in the 10.0 µg/L treatment (Figure 7B). Finally, there were 33 differentially expressed genes common to all treatments and time-points (Table 1). Gene ontology of these genes indicates predominant involvement in cellular structure and extracellular matrix, cell proliferation, apoptosis, transcription, hormone signaling and male reproduction. Additionally, multiple nuclear receptors involved in reproductive hormone signaling were differentially expressed during all doses and time-points including NR0B1 (DAX1), NR0B2 (SHP1), NR3C3 (PGR) and NR5A1 (SF-1).The 54 common genes in the 1.0 µg/L EE2 treatment group, the 92 common genes in the 10.0 µg/L EE2 treatment group, the 2141 genes unique to day 14 1.0 µg/L EE2 treatment group, and the 4546 unique genes to day 14 10.0 µg/L EE2 treatment group, highlighted by the yellow box, were used for Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052479.g007https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052479.t001Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was employed to assess the signaling pathways and functionality of gene expression changes using gene lists representing the following differentially expressed transcripts (as highlighted in Figure 7A and B): 1) genes common to all sampling days in the 1.0 µg/L treatment group (54 genes); 2) genes common to all sampling days in the 10.0 µg/L treatment group (92 genes); 3) genes unique to day 14 of exposure in the 1.0 µg/L treatment group (2141 genes); and 4) genes unique to day 14 of exposure in the 10.0 µg/L treatment group (4546 genes). The top Molecular Networks and their associated genes from the IPA analysis within each of the above differentially expressed gene sets are listed in Tables 2 and 3. These networks had scores between 16 and 64 indicating likely interactions between each network and focus genes from the input data set. Each network was assembled with 35 focus genes permitted. Canonical Pathways generated from differentially expressed genes unique to day 14 for both the 1.0 µg/L and 10.0 µg/L EE2 treatments are listed in Table 4. These pathways reflect many of the genes and molecules highlighted in the Molecular Networks. A further comparison of the Molecular Networks generated from gene lists of the differentially expressed genes common to all days in the 1.0 µg/L and 10.0 µg/L EE2 treatments indicated multiple network molecules and genes identified in both treatments. Gene ontology of these network genes indicates involvement in multiple biological functions including apoptosis and cell death, cell cycle and proliferation, collagen, cytoskeletal organization, hormone signaling, male gonad function and others (Table 2). Of these genes and molecules, multiple examples were seen with important and well known involvement in hormone signaling and male reproduction including CYP19A1, FSH, GPER, Insulin, Lh, NR0B1, NR0B2, NR5A1, Smad, and SOX9. Gene expression and pathway analysis also suggests a perturbation of important mitogenic and apoptotic signaling pathways throughout the EE2 exposure, including ERK1/2, NFκB, P38, MAPK, PDGF, PKA, Smad, and TGF beta. Interestingly, an increased prevalence of differentially expressed genes within these pathways was associated with increased exposure concentration and time.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052479.t002https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052479.t003https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052479.t004A comparison of the molecules and genes mapped to the top 5 IPA molecular networks generated from differentially expressed genes unique on day 14 in the 1.0 µg/L and 10.0 µg/L EE2 treatments additionally indicate multiple network molecules identified in both treatments. Gene ontology of these genes indicates involvement in glycolysis, transcription and angiogenesis, translation, and ubiquitination (Table 3). It is important to bear in mind that while not all of the network genes are differentially expressed, the generated networks show relationships and connectivity between the genes suggesting involvement and possible perturbation of these signaling processes.The aim of the present investigations was to achieve an integrated understanding of the effects of a 14 day exposure of EE2 on male reproductive parameters and to relate these to alterations in testicular structure and gene expression. Our data indicate 1) fertility decreased in a concentration dependent manner upon EE2 exposure, 2) morphologic alterations were time and concentration dependent and included altered spermatogenesis and thickening of the interstitium, and 3) gene expression changes were time and concentration dependent with IPA networks indicating involvement in multiple molecular pathways and signal transduction cascades.Our reproductive assessment was designed to allow us to specifically assess male reproductive capacity without the confounding factor of exposed females. Fertility of adult males decreased in a concentration dependent manner with fertilization rates of 62.8% and 28.8%, after exposure to 1.0 µg/L and 10.0 µg/L EE2, respectively. Other studies in medaka, zebrafish and fathead minnow that assessed effects of estradiol exposure on reproduction also showed a decrease in male fertility [10], [23], [24], [38]–[44]. Interestingly, we also observed a decrease in the number of eggs laid per day following reintroduction of males post-exposure to their unexposed female breeding group in both treatment groups. The exact cause of this phenomenon is unknown, however, a previous study observed altered male courtship behavior and decreased copulation of EE2 exposed male medaka although no changes in female egg production was observed [10].With the ability of EDCs to disrupt reproduction it is important to understand the potential ecologic implications. The reproductive impairments demonstrated in this study highlight the potential ecological impact of estrogen exposure at the population level. Whole lake exposure studies assessing fish populations in Canada to environmentally relevant EE2 concentrations found ecotoxicological effects that led to a population collapse in multiple fish species due to altered reproduction and subsequent lack of young of the year needed to maintain the populations [19], [20]. Our study adds further weight to the male role in impaired reproduction by demonstrating that estrogen exposure compounded reproductive effects through decreased fertilization rates and fecundity in females, possibly due to behavioral alterations in males.The histologic analysis of testes from the exposed non-breeding males found a decrease in early stage germ cells (spermatogonia and spermatocytes), an increase in apoptotic germ cells and a generalized thickening of the interstitium. Previous studies report similar findings to ours regarding altered testicular histology following estradiol exposure in fish, including fathead minnow, zebrafish and medaka [10], [24], [40], [42], [44], [45]. While the exposure time and concentrations vary, the histological alterations observed are similar to the changes reported here including altered spermatogenesis, testicular disorganization, testicular oocytes, thickening of the interstitium and fibrosis.Our histologic assessment of the testis following the breeding experiment indicate similar alterations. However, these actively breeding males had an accentuated testicular morphology compared to their EE2 exposed, nonbreeding counterparts. Even the control breeding males had changes in the gonad including an increase in early stage germ cells and a slight thickening of the interstitium. This is likely due to an overall decreased volume of mature sperm indicating active reproduction. A histologic comparison of the EE2 treated breeding and non-breeding males indicates that the EE2 treated breeding males had a furthered morphologic change compared to their non-breeding counterparts (males depurated for 14 days in the absence of females). It is important to keep in mind that breeding males actively expelled mature sperm, evident by successful fertilization, albeit decreased in the EE2 treated breeding males. Continuous spermatogenesis is needed to replenish spermatozoa reserves that fill the efferent duct space. We hypothesize that the active dispelling of spermatozoa from the breeding males plays a role in the appearance of accentuated thickened interstitium observed in both control and treated animals due to a decrease of late stage germ cells occupying lobule and efferent duct space. In the 1.0 µg/L treatment group, the non-breeding males allowed to depurate unaccompanied by females showed signs of recovery while males in the presence of females had the most significant testicular changes of this treatment group, including a further increase in interstitial thickening and a decrease in germinal epithelium. In the 10.0 µg/L treatment group, following the depuration period there was no sign of recovery in the non-breeding males. However, breeding males had even further morphologic degeneration with, again, severe thickening of the interstitium, and significant depletion of germinal epithelium accompanied by altered spermatogenesis.We also sought to link EE2 induced altered testicular morphology to possible perturbation of proper cell signaling due to altered gene expression. The IPA networks allowed us to identify functional testicular gene networks and signaling pathways associated with the EE2 exposure. While no histologic changes were observed in the testis on day 1 of exposure, gene expression changes involving critical functions were observed. This indicates that EE2 induced gene expression changes precede morphologic changes in the testis. This same pattern of gene expression changes preceding altered morphology was previously described in the liver of medaka following TCDD exposure [46]. The pattern of change is observed with genes involved in apoptosis and cell proliferation and subsequent altered spermatogenesis as well as in angiogenesis, wound healing and collagen production and subsequent thickening of the interstitium.When comparing IPA networks for genes common to all sampling days in the 1.0 µg/L and 10.0 µg/L EE2 treatment groups, multiple genes and molecules involved in hormone signaling and male reproduction were mapped to the networks including CYP19a (aromatase), FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), Insulin, LH (luteinizing hormone), NR0B1 (DAX1), NR0B2 (SHP), NR5A1 (SF1), and SOX9. All are integral to the endocrine system, proper Leydig and Sertoli cell function and subsequently reproduction (for reviews see [31], [47]–[53]. With the many feedback mechanisms involved with hormone homeostasis and subsequent male reproductive function, it is anticipated that hormone signaling would be altered through the entirety of the EE2 exposure.Testicular function is dependent on proper hormone signaling and a tightly controlled balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis. Our observations of decreased germ cells and increased apoptotic cells reflect changes in gene expression and signaling pathways associated with cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis. The IPA networks of significant genes common to all days in the 1.0 µg/L and 10.0 µg/L treatments identified multiple genes associated with established signaling pathways important to these functions including ERK1/2 MAPK, p38 MAPK, PDGF, and TGFβ (Table 2). These genes and their associated pathways are interdependent with critical cross-talk between pathways important in coordinating cellular responses. Interestingly, KEGG pathway analysis (www.genome.jp/kegg/) indicates various combinations of these genes found together in multiple pathways but all are found within the MAPK pathway (map04010; http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map04010). The MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways are responsive to estrogen signaling and play an integral role in maintaining the balance of cell proliferation and apoptosis in multiple cell types within the testis [54–60,61a,62–64]. This signaling has been shown to be particularly important in germ cells and Sertoli cells including cell cycle progression of spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids and Sertoli-germ cell adheren junctions. These gene signaling pathways also have roles or engage in crosstalk with pathways involved in the other biological functions which were also identified in the IPA network including wound healing, inflammation and cytoskeleton organization.ERK/MAPK signaling also appeared in the IPA assessment of significantly different genes unique to day 14 in both treatments when histologic changes are most extensive. In the 10.0 µg/L treatment group, the ERK/MAPK pathway was the second ranked canonical pathway with multiple associated transcription factors differentially expressed including ESR, ETS, STAT1/3, ELK1, c-Myc, and N-Myc. Furthermore, of particular interest is the central role of Myc family of oncogenes in the top molecular network (Figure 8). This suggests that the disruption of the Myc gene family has an important role in changes observed on day 14 in the 10.0 µg/L treatment group which has the most significant reproductive effect, testicular alterations and no evident recovery. Myc is activated with various mitogenic signals including MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT and broadly influences genes important to many functions involved in cell proliferation, cell growth, apoptosis, differentiation and stem cell renewal, including spermatogonial stem cell proliferation [65]–[72]. Furthermore, transcription targets of Myc or other transcription regulators with which Myc partners, were differentially expressed in our study including: TERT, BRCA1, CDKs (cyclin dependent kinases), EIF4s (eukaryotic translation initiation factors), EEFs (eukaryotic translation elongation factors), E2Fs (transcription factors), histone H4, histone deacetylases (HDACs), RPLs and RPSs (ribosomal protein large and small subunits), NCOR, NCL, APEX1, and DDX18 [67], [73]–[78]. An emphasis on Myc genes further suggests that the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways are important to the testicular effects seen from the EE2 treatment and may indicate the extent to which these and associated pathways are disturbed in the 10.0 µg/L EE2 treatment group.Myc family of genes is central to this Molecular Network suggesting an important role in the observed changes in gene expression and histology on day 14 in the 10.0 µg/L treatment group.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052479.g008The second top molecular network of genes unique to day 14 in the 10.0 µg/L treatment group centers on G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs; Figure 9). Many significantly different GPCRs are part of this network, including the G protein estrogen receptor (GPER). GPCRs are a large family of proteins important in multiple signal transduction pathways whose agonists include neurotransmitters, hormones, chemokines, and bioactive lipids [79], [80]. Not surprisingly, GPCRs are important regulators of cell survival, apoptosis, movement, proliferation, differentiation and growth. Additionally, all four classes of G proteins are able to regulate MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways and subsequent transcription factors through multiple mechanisms of action [79], [80]. Estrogen signaling occurs through both the classical (genomic) estrogen signaling pathway, as well as through nongenomic signaling in which estrogen rapidly activates protein kinases (MAPK, PI3K, and PKC), adenylate cyclase, calcium and cAMP [81], [82]. This has been shown to be regulated through membrane bound ESR and the aforementioned GPER [83], [84]. Additionally, there has been extensive data, particularly in breast cancer research, demonstrating crosstalk between estrogen signaling and ErbB2/HER2/neu, a membrane tyrosine kinase epidermal growth factor receptor, regulating MAPK and AKT signaling [85]. ErbB2 is differentially regulated on day 14 in both the 1.0 and 10.0 µg/L treatments. This suggests that perturbation of both genomic and nongenomic estrogen signaling networks in this model.G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are emphasized in this Molecular Network indicating a significant effect on G-protein signaling pathways including the G-protein estrogen receptor (GPER) on day 14 in the 10.0 µg/L treatment group.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052479.g009Microarray assessments of EE2 induced testicular gene expression changes carried out in zebrafish and medaka find multiple genes in common to our results [23], [27]. Hirakawa et al. [27] identified candidate genes of testicular ooctyes in EE2 exposed adult male medaka through microarray analysis. Interestingly, multiple genes which they emphasized, were also differentially expressed in our study including zona pellucida genes (ZP1, ZP3), vitellogenin 1 (VTG1), FIGalpha (FIGLA), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E family member 3 (EIF4E). Real-time PCR follow up of their candidate genes suggests that Zpc5 is the most reliable testicular oocyte marker gene, which is not significantly different in our study. This is to be expected since testicular oocytes were not frequently observed during our 14 day EE2 exposure.Similar to Santos et al. [23], our study found that ubiquitin genes were differentially regulated with time and concentration and identified in IPA molecular networks. During spermatogenesis, ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis is important for cellular condensation of germ cells [86]. Perturbation of this ubiquitin process has been implicated in the degradation of sperm quality [87]. While Santos et al. [23] did not note any histological alterations in the testis, sperm quality analysis indicated decreased motility. They suggest the EE2 induced alterations of gene expression profiles in the ubiquitin system and in glutathione peroxidase are likely mechanisms that led to lower sperm quality, and decreased fertilization success observed in the males in their study. Our data also suggests that altered ubiquitination may also play a role in the observed altered testicular function and decreased fertility.Together, these microarray studies assessing EE2 induced gene expression changes in the testis highlight the importance of pairing the results with morphologic alterations. There is a continuum of gonadal changes that develop following EE2 exposure dependent on dose and time, as evident by results observed. Each of these described gene expression analyses, while having some similarities, have many differences. When put into context with their respective histologic assessments a more complete depiction is possible. Furthermore, this range of altered testicular morphology is reported in the literature and therefore understanding the associated range of gene expression changes, assumes additional relevance. For example, in the previously described whole lake EE2 exposure study, testicular tissue of fathead minnows collected early in the study showed similar altered morphology to our study including delayed spermatogenesis, widespread fibrosis and a decrease in spermatocytes [19]. However, in subsequent years testicular tissue had a higher prevalence of testicular oocytes. This ecological study is the quintessential example of the spectrum of EE2 induced altered testicular morphology and further illustrates the importance of a thorough understanding of the associated gene expression changes. Toxicity studies should ultimately strive for a comprehensive assessment of molecular, pathologic and apical repercussions.The goal of this study was to link reproductive impairments and altered testicular morphology induced by EE2 exposure in male medaka to testicular gene expression changes. We observed decreased fertility in both treatment groups along with time and concentration dependent morphologic changes including thickened interstitium and altered spermatogenesis. Finally, analysis of testis specific gene expression and pathway analysis anchored the alterations in structure and function of this male reproductive organ. Pathway analysis of significantly different genes from the microarray data suggests differential expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and wound healing, apoptosis, cell adhesion, cell death, cell cycle and proliferation, collagen, cytoskeletal organization, hormone signaling, male gonad function, and ubiquitination among others. There is more to be done, especially in regard to a further detailed understanding of the altered signaling pathways and subsequent sequence of events that lead to altered testicular morphology in exposed individuals. However, the groundwork is now established for an integrative understanding of the role of EE2 on testis structure and function.Experiments were conducted using approved Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols.EE2 (98% purity, Fluka, St. Louis, MO) was used to prepare nominal stocks (0.004, 0.04, and 0.4 mg/ml) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The stocks were stored at room temperature in the dark.Orange-red (OR) outbred-medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) were maintained at the Duke University Aquatic Research Facility under standard recirculating water conditions following approved animal care and maintenance protocols (Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee). Water temperature and pH were monitored daily and maintained at ∼25°C and ∼7.4, respectively, and broodstock were under a strict light:dark cycle of 16∶8 hours. Dry food (Otohime B1, Reed Mariculture, Campbell, CA) was fed several times per day via automated feeders with once daily supplementation of newly-hatched Artemia nauplii. Adults reared under the above conditions were used in all aspects of this study including gene expression, histology and reproduction (see below).This consisted of three time periods: pre-exposure, male exposure, and post-exposure. Throughout all three time-periods, egg production and fertilization rate were monitored.Reproductively active, 5–6 month old adult medaka were placed randomly in breeding groups consisting of three females and one male (25 breeding groups total). Each breeding group was maintained in a 2-L glass beaker with 1800 mL of embryo rearing medium (ERM; [88]. Daily renewal of 75% of the medium was performed. Each breeding group received approximately 2 mg/day dry food (Otohime, Reed Mariculture, Campbell, CA, USA) and artemia nauplii twice per day. Beakers were arranged randomly in isolation and maintained under a 16∶8 light:dark cycle for 12 days. Eggs were collected and fecundity of each breeding group was established daily. Fertilization rate of each group was determined under a dissecting microscope according to procedures previously described [89], [90]. After the pre-exposure period, each breeding group was randomly assigned to one of three treatments groups.Each male was removed and placed individually in a designated 500-mL beaker for the male exposure period. Males were treated with 500 mL of spiked ERM with either DMSO (control)0op, 1.0 µg/L EE2 or 10.0 µg/L EE2 for 14 days with a 50% renewal every 48 hours. Males were fed approximately 0.5 mg/day dry food and artemia nauplii daily and maintained under a 16∶8 light:dark cycle. Throughout the male exposure, females were maintained in 2-L glass beakers with 1800 mL ERM as described in the pre-exposure period. Fecundity and fertilization rates of females were monitored during this time.Individual males were returned to their original beaker for breeding to maintain consistency of breeding groups. For each breeding group, fecundity and fertilization rate were recorded on days 1–14, 17 and 20 of the post exposure period. Water conditions were maintained in the same manner as above, including the daily 75% water renewal. This design made it possible to relate morphology of testis to each individual’s fertilization success prior to and following exposure. On day 20 post-exposure of the breeding experiment, males were anesthetized in ice-cold ERM and the testis was removed and processed for paraffin based histological analysis as described below.One-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey HSD post-hoc test was performed to assess treatment effects of EE2 exposures using JMP 8 (SAS Institute Inc.). The number of eggs produced/day, number of fertilized eggs/day and the fertilization percentage of eggs laid/day were used to analyze differences between treatment groups. All data in figures are presented as the mean ± SEM. P<0.05 was considered significant.Treatment exposures were completed in triplicate including DMSO (vehicle control), 1.0 µg/L EE2, and 10.0 µg/L EE2. Fish were sampled for histology and gene expression on days 1, 7 and 14 of exposure and for histology only on day 14 post-exposure depuration (recovery). For histologic analysis, 2-liter beaker replicates received 23 individuals each for exposures for the days 1, 7 and 14 time point and a separate set of beakers received 11 fish for the post-exposure day 14 depuration time point. For gene expression analysis, 5 male fish were placed in 2-liter beaker replicates for each treatment and sampling time point. ERM was spiked with the appropriate EE2 stock (0.0025% of total volume) and equally distributed between the 2-L beakers for a total of 2 L spiked ERM per beaker with a 50% renewal of spiked ERM every other day for 14 days. Following the 14 day exposure, fish for histologic analysis were placed into fresh ERM for 2 days and then moved into a flow-through system until time of sacrifice, i.e. 14 days post-exposure. The fish were maintained under a 16∶8 hour light:dark cycle and fed ad libitum the dry diet as above on alternate days.This was performed as follows: high resolution on control animals for general testicular anatomy and morphology; analysis of males on day 1, 7 and 14 of EE2 exposure and day 14 post-exposure depuration (recovery); and analysis of actively breeding medaka following EE2 exposure as described above in the reproductive assessment.Adult male 6 month old fish collected from our colony were anesthetized in ice-cold ERM. The testis was removed and fixed in a cocktail of 0.5% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde, 1% sucrose and 1% CaCl2 in Histochoice (Amresco, Solon, Ohio) for 24 hours at 4°C followed by immersion in Holt’s gum sucrose solution (1% aqueous gum arabic and 30% aqueous sucrose) at 4°C for ≥24 hours [91]. Tissue samples were then embedded in glycol methacrylate, sectioned at 2.5 µm thickness, mounted on glass histological slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.At each sampling time-point during exposure, 1–2 fish from each replicate beaker were anesthetized in ice-cold ERM, and the testis was collected for histology. Testes were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for a minimum of 72 hr at 4°C and stored in 6% sucrose/PBS at 4°C until time of processing. Following dehydration in a graded series of ethanol (70% (×1), 85% (×1), 95% (×1) and 100% (×3) for 10 minutes each) and clearing in xylene (10 min ×3) tissues were embedded in paraffin (Paraplast® Plus, McCormick Scientific, St. Louis, MO). 5-µm thick, longitudinal serial sections were cut using a Microm HM 355 S microtome (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Walldorf, Germany) through the entire organ, mounted on histological slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for analysis.For gene expression, the testis of three fish per replicate beaker (n = 3) were removed as previously described [46], [92], pooled and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA isolation. In short, three pooled testes were homogenized with 1 ml RNA Bee (TelTest, Friendswood, Texas) using a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica, Bohemia, New York) cleaned with RNaseZAP (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri), diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated water, and sterile de-ionized water. Total RNA was purified from the homogenate using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California) followed by an on-column-digest with DNase to eliminate DNA contamination using RNase-free DNase Set according to manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, California). The sample was then eluted with 30 µl RNase-free water (52°C). Total RNA samples were stored at −80°C. RNA concentrations were assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California). Each sample was analyzed for gene expression using one medaka array per biological sample (n = 3).Probes were produced by mining the medaka Ensembl Genome Browser using the biomart function for all annotated medaka genes based on the MEDAKA1 (October 2005) assembly provided by the National Institute of Genetics (NIG) and the University of Tokyo. This resulted in 15,207 predicted gene sequences. All medaka genes were assigned homologs to the Human Ensembl Genebuild 36 (http://useast.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Info/Index?db=core). Seventy-mer oligo probes were designed using the eArray portal with defined quality control parameters for both cross hybridization and base composition score. RNA was amplified using the Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent); and was annealed with a primer containing a polydT and a T7 polymerase promoter for reverse transcription and first and second strand cDNA synthesis. cRNA was produced using T7 RNA polymerase and incorporated cyanine-5 (Cy5) labeled CTP. The quality of the labeled cRNA was verified and concentration was measured spectrophotometrically. Control or experimental cRNA (0.75 µg) was hybridized to each array as a single channel hybridization. Hybridization was conducted on a custom 15K ×8 Agilent medaka array using the “In situ Hybridization Kit-Plus” (Agilent) at 60°C for 17 h. The arrays were washed according to Agilent's SSPE wash protocol using a solution of 6× SSPE, 0.005% N-lauroylsarcosine, followed by a solution of 0.06× SSPE, 0.005% N-lauroylsarcosine, and Agilent's Stabilization and Drying Solution. The arrays were scanned on an Agilent G2565BA Microarray Scanner and data from the scans were compiled with Agilent Feature Extraction Software 8.1.Analysis of the microarray data was performed using JMP Genomics 4.1(SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina). Data was log2 transformed during the import process and normalized using the standard normalization routine implemented in JMP Genomics 4.1. A distribution analysis was conducted for quality control purposes prior- and subsequent to normalization and alignment of the overlay plots was used as an indicator of high quality data. Data analysis was performed by conducting a principal component analysis (PCA) by day and treatment using time-matched treatment-to-control differences calculated from standard least-square mean. An ANOVA was performed to test for statistical differences between treatment and control groups on a day by day basis. The False Discovery Rate (FDR) at alpha 0.05 was used to account for the multiple testing problem. Hierarchical clustering was performed using the significant gene sets derived from the ANOVA analysis data set. Microarray gene expression data was deposited in Gene Expression Ominbus (GEO; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo).Genes for which differential expression was significant were further analyzed through the use of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; Ingenuity® Systems, www.ingenuity.com). A data set containing significantly different genes based on our ANOVA analysis with their corresponding gene identifiers was uploaded into the application and used for molecular network and canonical pathway generation. Each identifier was mapped to its corresponding object in Ingenuity’s Knowledge Base and molecular networks were generated based on their connectivity. Canonical pathways most significant to the data set were identified, from Ingenuity Pathways Analysis library. The significance of the association between the data set and the canonical pathway was measured in 2 ways: 1) A ratio of the number of molecules from the data set that map to the pathway divided by the total number of molecules that map to the canonical pathway; and 2) Fisher’s exact test, to calculate a p-value determining the probability that the association between the genes in the dataset and the canonical pathway is explained by chance alone.We thank laboratory member David Volz for his advice and guidance with this research and assistance in conducting preliminary studies.

To dissect the molecular basis for the development and reversal of sex differences in the teleost brain, we screened for genes differentially expressed between sexes in the brain of medaka (Oryzias latipes). One of the genes identified in the screen as being preferentially expressed in females was found to be a new member of the heme-binding protein gene family that includes hebp1 and hebp2 and was designated here as hebp3. The medaka hebp3 is expressed in the meninges with higher abundance in females, whereas there is no expression within the brain parenchyma. This female-biased expression of hebp3 is not attributable to the direct action of sex chromosome genes but results from the transient and reversible action of estrogens derived from the ovary. Moreover, estrogens directly activate the transcription of hebp3 via a palindromic estrogen-responsive element in the hebp3 promoter. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that hebp3 is a novel transcriptional target of estrogens, with female-biased expression in the meninges. The definite but reversible sexual dimorphism of the meningeal hebp3 expression may contribute to the development and reversal of sex differences in the teleost brain.The brains of mammals and birds undergo an irreversible process of sexual differentiation early in development, under the influence of steroid hormones and sex chromosome genes (1). Conversely, the brains of teleost fish exhibit a considerable degree of sexual plasticity throughout their lifetime (2). This is exemplified by the fact that the phenotypic sex of teleost fish, including sex-specific behavioral patterns, can be manipulated by treatment with exogenous steroid hormones, even in adulthood (3). Moreover, quite a few teleost species spontaneously undergo phenotypic sex reversal in response to social and physiological events (2). Owing to this feature, teleosts provide unique and valuable opportunities to explore the process of the development and reversal of brain sex differences. However, the molecular and cellular basis for this process in the teleost brain remains largely unknown.In the present study, we screened for genes exhibiting sexually dimorphic expression in the brain of medaka (Oryzias latipes), which is widely used as a model teleost species for sex differences and sexual differentiation. One of the genes identified as being predominantly expressed in females was found to be a novel member of the highly conserved heme-binding protein (hebp) gene family that includes hebp1 (also called p22hbp) and hebp2 (also called soul) (4–8). HEBP1 was originally isolated from the mouse liver and found to be ubiquitously expressed in diverse tissues (5). It has been suggested that HEBP1 is involved in hemoglobin synthesis in erythroid cells (5, 9). In addition, this protein includes a natural chemoattractant peptide of 21 amino acids at the N terminus, which is an endogenous ligand for formyl peptide receptor-like receptor 2 and promotes calcium mobilization and chemotaxis in monocytes and dendritic cells (10, 11). On the other hand, hebp2 was first identified in chickens and, in contrast to hebp1, is abundantly expressed in only a few tissues, including the retina and pineal gland (6). Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that HEBP2 can promote mitochondrial permeability transition and resultant cell death (12, 13). In line with this, HEBP2 contains a Bcl-2 homology 3 domain-like motif, by which it can interact with and consequently inhibit the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL (13, 14).Despite the fundamental biological roles of the hebp1/hebp2 family genes, virtually nothing is known about the regulatory mechanisms of their expression, with only 1 study showing that hebp1 is up-regulated by an erythroid transcription factor, GATA1 (15). Here we demonstrate that the newly identified member of the hebp1/hebp2 family, named hebp3, is expressed in the meninges, the membrane enveloping the brain parenchyma, of medaka, with higher levels in females than males. Our data also show that this female-biased meningeal expression of hebp3 results from the direct transcriptional activation by estrogens of ovarian origin.The care and use of animals in this study were in accordance with the guidelines of the Committee on Life Sciences of the University of Tokyo. Medaka of the d-rR strain were bred and maintained at 28°C with a 14-hour light (0830–2230 hours), 10-hour dark (2230-0830 hours) photoperiod and were fed 3-4 times a day with live brine shrimp and commercial pellet food. All sampling was carried out over 1-2.5 hours after the onset of light (0930–1100 hours), unless otherwise noted.A differential screen was conducted to identify genes with sexually dimorphic expression in the medaka brain as described previously (16). Briefly, suppression subtractive hybridization was performed between the male and female brains of sexually mature, spawning medaka by using a PCR-select cDNA subtraction kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, California). A total of 3072 clones was randomly selected from each of the male transcript- and female transcript-enriched subtractive libraries and were sequenced in a single direction with a BigDye Terminator version 3.1 cycle sequencing kit on an ABI Prism 3100 genetic analyzer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California). After clustering and assembly, a total of 768 clusters of clones was subjected to dot-blot analysis to validate the differential expression between the sexes, using an AlkPhos direct labeling and detection system with CDP-Star (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). Positive clusters were further evaluated for differential expression by real-time PCR using Power SYBR Green PCR master mix on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Life Technologies).In the present study, we focused on a cluster of clones identified in the screen as exhibiting female-biased expression. The full-length cDNA corresponding to this cluster (cluster ID: SSH-0340) was isolated, sequenced, and annotated as follows. A full-length expressed sequence tag (EST) library was generated from the medaka brain and approximately 32 000 ESTs were randomly selected and sequenced in the 5′ to 3′ direction as described previously (16). After assembly and annotation, 30 ESTs, which had best blast hits to hebp1 and hebp2 in other vertebrates, were found to represent the full-length cDNA corresponding to the SSH-0340 sequence. One of these ESTs (clone ID: 34-O01) was fully sequenced to determine its full-length sequence.The deduced amino acid sequence of this EST was aligned with those of known hebp1 and hebp2 in other species using Clustal W, and a phylogenetic tree was then constructed using the neighbor-joining method (http://clustalw.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/index.php). The sequences and accession numbers used for the analysis are shown in Supplemental Table 1, published on The Endocrine Society's Journals Online web site at http://endo.endojournals.org. Contrary to expectation, however, the tree suggested that this EST belongs to neither the hebp1 nor hebp2 subfamily but instead is a new independent member of the hebp1/hebp2 family (Supplemental Figure 1); it was thus designated hebp3.To verify this result, a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed by including Hebp1/Hebp2-like sequences newly identified in the public databases as described below. The Ensembl genome database (http://www.ensembl.org/index.html) was searched to identify hebp1/hebp2-like genes predicted in the genomes of vertebrate species of evolutionary interest, including opossum (Monodelphis domestica), platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), Xenopus (Xenopus tropicalis), fugu (Takifugu rubripes), and zebrafish (Danio rerio) as well as medaka. The EST database of National BioResource Project (NBRP) Medaka (http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/medaka/) was also searched to identify hebp1/hebp2-like ESTs in medaka. The predicted gene products and EST clones identified are shown in Supplemental Table 2. Human BCL2L11 (NP_619527) and BAD (NP_004313), both of which, like HEBP2, contain the Bcl-2 homology 3 domain (13), were used as an outgroup for tree reconstruction.The deduced amino acid sequences of the medaka hebp3 and the sequences identified in silico as described above were analyzed for the presence of specific domains or motifs using InterProScan (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/pfa/iprscan/) and SignalP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/).Differential expression of hebp3 in the male and female brain was further evaluated by real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated from the whole brain of adult spawning male (n = 12) and female (n = 12) medaka using an RNeasy lipid tissue minikit with deoxyribonuclease I treatment (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). cDNA was synthesized using an Omniscript reverse transcriptase kit (QIAGEN). PCR was performed using Power SYBR Green PCR master mix on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Life Technologies). The expression of β-actin (actb) in each sample was used to normalize the expression of hebp3 by the standard curve method. PCR primers used are listed in Supplemental Table 3. Further details on the real-time PCR procedure are provided in the Supplemental Materials and Methods.In addition, Northern blot analysis was performed on the male and female medaka brains to ensure that hebp3 was differentially expressed by sex and that the sequence obtained by the above-mentioned procedure represented the full-length cDNA. A 745-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides 21-765 of the hebp3 cDNA was PCR amplified and labeled with digoxygenin (DIG) using the DIG RNA labeling mix (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) to generate a DIG-labeled hebp3 antisense probe. Northern blotting was performed with this probe as described in the Supplemental Materials and Methods.The whole brain was dissected from adult spawning fish at 3-4 months postfertilization (mpf) and juvenile fish at 1 mpf, at which stage secondary sexual characteristics (sex differences in the shape of the dorsal and anal fins) began to appear (n = 5 for each sex at each stage). The brain was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Serial coronal sections of 8 μm thickness were cut throughout the entire brain. In situ hybridization was carried out with the DIG-labeled hebp3 antisense probe described above using a standard procedure (17). The sense probe complementary to the antisense probe was also synthesized and used in parallel as a negative control.Medaka are diurnal fish and undergo daily cycles of gametogenesis and spawning. The expression of hebp3 in the brain was examined at different times of day by real-time PCR to determine whether its sexual dimorphism varies, depending on the reproductive and/or diurnal cycle. The whole brain was removed from adult spawning male (n = 7) and female (n = 7) medaka at 4-hour intervals across a 24-hour period (0600, 1000, 1400, 1800, 2200, and 0200 hours). RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and real-time PCR were performed as described above.The expression of hebp3 during sexual development was also evaluated by real-time PCR as described above, using the whole brain of male (n = 8) and female (n = 8) fish at the following stages: 1 mpf, at which stage secondary sexual characteristics began to appear; 2 mpf, at which stage fish were juvenile and had not yet spawned; 3 mpf, at which stage fish had become sexually mature and spawned; and 7 mpf, at which stage fish had regressed somewhat and the frequency of spawning had declined.We examined whether the sex difference in hebp3 expression in the brain coincided with the genetic sex or phenotypic sex by producing and using sex-reversed medaka for expression analysis. XX males and XY females were produced as described previously (16). For details, see Supplemental Materials and Methods. The whole brain was removed from these XX males and XY females as well as wild-type XY males and XX females, all of which were sexually mature and spawning (n = 8 for each group). Total RNA isolation and real-time PCR were carried out to assess hebp3 expression as described above.The ovary was surgically removed from sexually mature and spawning females following the procedure from an earlier study (18). Ovariectomized fish were treated with 100 ng/mL of estradiol-17β (E2) or 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT; the most prominent, nonaromatizable teleost androgen) or vehicle alone (0.01% ethanol) by immersion in saline for 5 days (n = 8 for each group). The steroid concentration used was determined according to previous reports of serum steroid levels in medaka (19–21). Sham-operated female fish (n = 8) were treated with vehicle alone as controls. The whole brain of these fish was dissected out and used for real-time PCR to assess the effects of steroid hormones on hebp3 expression as described above, except that the PCR was performed using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master on a LightCycler 480 System II (Roche Diagnostics). Further details on the real-time PCR procedure are provided in the Supplemental Materials and Methods.Sexually mature, spawning males and females with intact gonads were also treated with 100 ng/mL of E2 or 11-KT or vehicle alone (0.01% ethanol) by immersion in water for 9 days (n = 8 for each group). The whole brain was removed and used for real-time PCR as described above.The expression of all three ER genes in medaka, esr1, esr2a, and esr2b, was examined in the meninges to evaluate the possibility that estrogens might act directly on the meningeal cells to stimulate hebp3. In situ hybridization failed to detect the meningeal expression of any ER genes (data not shown). Accordingly, real-time PCR, a more sensitive method, was used. The meninges, as well as the whole brain with the meninges attached, serving as a control, were removed from adult spawning medaka of both sexes (n = 3 for each group). RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and real-time PCR on a LightCycler 480 System II (Roche Diagnostics) were performed as described above. In addition to the ER genes, the expressions of hebp3 and 2 neuronal markers, neurofilament light (nefl) and neurod, were assessed to ensure correct sampling of the meninges. The medaka nefl and neurod cDNAs were cloned in silico by searching the full-length cDNA database of the NBRP Medaka for sequences homologous to known nefl and neurod genes in other species. Two clones, olbrno20g19 and oleano8b05, were found to be representative of the full-length cDNAs for nefl and neurod, respectively. PCR primers used are listed in Supplemental Table 3.Because the hebp3 locus in the medaka genome database contained a few sequence gaps, we sequenced and analyzed this locus. A medaka bacterial artificial chromosome clone (clone ID: 10-O05) containing the hebp3 locus was obtained from the NBRP Medaka. An 18.5-kb region of the hebp3 locus was sequenced. The sequence was then scanned with Match (public version 1.0; http://www.gene-regulation.com/pub/programs.html#match) and Dragon ERE Finder (version 3; http://datam.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/ereV3/) to search for possible estrogen-responsive elements (EREs) in the proximal promoter region of hebp3.A 1450-bp fragment upstream of the first methionine codon of hebp3, containing 1412 bp of the proximal promoter region plus 38 bp of exon 1, was PCR amplified and ligated into the NheI site of the pGL4.10 luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin). This construct was termed pGL4.10-hebp3. The full open reading frame of each of the 3 medaka ERs, Esr1, Esr2a, and Esr2b, was PCR amplified and ligated into the expression vector pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Life Technologies). The resulting constructs were termed pcDNA3.1-ER (pcDNA3.1-Esr1, pcDNA3.1-Esr2a, and pcDNA3.1-Esr2b).HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pGL4.10-hebp3, 1 of the 3 pcDNA3.1-ER constructs, and an internal control vector pGL4.74 at a ratio of 8:1:1 using Lipofectamine LTX (Life Technologies). Six hours after transfection, cells were treated with E2 at doses of 0, 10−11, 10−9, and 10−7 M in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies) for 42 hours. The cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated 3 times.The above sequence analysis resulted in the identification of an imperfect palindromic ERE-like sequence (GGGTCAcacTGACAT) in the hebp3 proximal promoter region. To determine whether estrogen regulation of hebp3 was mediated through this putative ERE, we performed site-directed mutagenesis. Because it has been shown that an ERE half-site is sufficient for the transcriptional activation of several genes (22, 23), mutations were introduced into either 1 or both of the putative ERE half-sites in pGL4.10-hebp3. Each half-site was mutated into a HindIII recognition site (AAGCTT) using the PrimeSTAR mutagenesis basal kit (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). The resulting mutated (underlined) sequences were AAGCTTcacTGACAT (mutations in the 5′ half-site), GGGTCAcacAAGCTT (mutations in the 3′ half-site), and AAGCTTcacAAGCTT (mutations in both half-sites). The presence of the correct mutation was confirmed by sequencing. Luciferase assay was carried out using these mutants as well as wild-type pGL4.10-hebp3, as described above, except that a single dose of E2 (10−7 M) was used.All data were presented as means and SEM. In all real-time PCR analyses, the expression level of hebp3 (normalized by that of actb) in the sexually mature male brain was arbitrarily set to 1, and the relative difference was calculated, to facilitate comparisons among analyses. The details of statistical analyses are provided in the Supplemental Materials and Methods.Suppression subtractive hybridization was performed to identify genes differentially expressed between the sexes in the medaka brain. One of the female-enriched library-specific sequences (cluster ID: SSH-0340) remained positive through subsequent dot-blot and real-time PCR screens. After construction and screening of the full-length medaka brain EST library, the SSH-0340 sequence was found to be identical with a portion of the ESTs, with top blast hits to the hebp1 and hebp2 cDNAs in other species. The corresponding full-length cDNA (deposited in GenBank with accession no. AB742441) was 841 bp in length, excluding the poly (A)+ tail and encoded a 213 amino acid protein with some homology to Hebp1 and Hebp2 in other vertebrate species.In silico screening of publicly available databases (Ensembl and NBRP Medaka) led to the identification of a variety of Hebp1/Hebp2-like sequences in vertebrate genomes. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis inclusive of these sequences revealed that the medaka cDNA identified by subtractive screening indeed encoded a member of the Hebp1/Hebp2 family, but it formed a distinct subbranch within the family. Thus, this cDNA did not represent the medaka ortholog of hebp1 or hebp2 and was named hebp3 (Figure 1A). Consistent with this, true medaka orthologs of hebp1 and hebp2 (ENSORLP00000018641 and olvlno1o23, respectively) were identified through a database search. Phylogenetic analysis further revealed that, in addition to Hebp1, Hebp2, and Hebp3, the family of these proteins contained 5 additional subfamilies, here designated Hebp4, Hebp5, Hebp6, Hebp7, and Hebp8. High bootstrap values at most major nodes indicated that the tree topology was robust.Identification of hebp3, a novel member of the hebp1/hebp2 family with female-biased expression in the medaka brain. A, Phylogenetic analysis of the translated medaka hebp3 sequence together with known Hebp1/Hebp2 proteins and Hebp1/Hebp2-like sequences identified in silico. This analysis demonstrated that the medaka Hebp3 (shown in reverse type) was not orthologous to either Hebp1 or Hebp2 and represented a novel member of the Hebp1/Hebp2 family and that the Hebp1/Hebp2 family comprised a total of 8 distinct subfamilies in vertebrates. The numbers at each node indicate bootstrap values for 1000 replicates. B, Real-time PCR after subtractive hybridization screening provided evidence that hebp3 was expressed at higher levels in the female adult brain than in the male brain (unpaired t test, t = 5.595, P < .0001). *** P < .001. C, Northern blot analysis identified a 1.0-kb transcript for hebp3 that was more abundant in the adult female than male brain, corroborating the results of cDNA cloning and real-time PCR.Amino acid sequence analysis of the medaka Hebp3 predicted a signal peptide at the N terminus with a cleavage site between residues 18 and 19. Similarly, all of the Hebp3, Hebp4, and Hebp5 proteins identified in silico, except the fugu Hebp4 (ENSTRUP00000040692) with incomplete sequence information at the N terminus, were predicted to have a signal peptide. No transmembrane domains were predicted for any of these proteins.Differential expression of the medaka hebp3 by sex was verified by real-time PCR. The results demonstrated that whole brain of mature females had approximately 1.7-fold higher hebp3 expression than that of mature males (Figure 1B). Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of a 1.0-kb transcript that was more abundant in the female brain than in the male brain (Figure 1C), further verifying that hebp3 had female-biased expression and that the hebp3 cDNA cloned here represented the full-length transcript.In situ hybridization was performed to localize the expression of hebp3 in the medaka brain. In both sexually mature and juvenile fish, clear hybridization signals were broadly and uniformly distributed throughout the meninges, whereas there were no signals anywhere in the brain parenchyma (Figure 2). Mature females appeared to have higher signal intensity than mature males throughout all portions of the meninges, coinciding with the results of real-time PCR and Northern blot analyses described above. In juvenile fish at 1 mpf, no obvious differences in signal intensity were seen between the sexes (data not shown). Hybridization with the sense probe as a negative control showed no signals (data not shown).Distribution of hebp3 expression in the brain of mature and juvenile medaka. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that hebp3 was expressed broadly and uniformly throughout the meninges but not in the brain parenchyma. Mature females (shown by panels F–J) appeared to have more intense expression than mature males (shown by panels A–E) throughout all portions of the meninges. Such a sex difference was not observed in juvenile fish, and accordingly, the expression of either sex is shown (panels K–O). Shown are photographs of representative brain regions: the telencephalon (A, F, and K), preoptic area (B, G, and L), optic tectum (C, H, and M), hypothalamus (D, I, and N), and celleberum (E, J, and O). All scale bars represent 100 μm.Reproductive/diurnal variation in hebp3 expression in the brain was assessed throughout the day by real-time PCR (Figure 3A). The expression of hebp3 in both sexes was higher in the light than in the dark. Females exhibited 1.4- to 1.6-fold higher expression than males at all time points examined.Expression patterns of hebp3 in the medaka brain during reproductive/diurnal cycles and sexual development as revealed by real-time PCR. A, Expression during reproductive/diurnal cycles. There were significant main effects of sex [F (1, 72) = 226.5, P < .0001] and time [F (5, 72) = 18.06, P < .0001] and a significant interaction between sex and time [F (5, 72) = 2.509, P = .0376]. Females (open squares) consistently expressed hebp3 at higher levels than males (filled squares) throughout the reproductive/diurnal cycles. B, Expression during sexual development. There were significant main effects of sex [F (1, 56) = 35.99, P < .0001] and stage [F (3, 56) = 124.0, P < .0001] and a significant interaction between sex and stage [F (3, 56) = 5.805, P = .0016]. Females (open squares) did not show significantly higher expression of hebp3 than males (filled squares) until 3 mpf, at which stage the fish had become sexually mature and spawned. * P < .05, ** P < .01, *** P < .001 between the sexes at the same time or stage. Groups with different alphabetical characters (capital letters for males and lower case letters for females) are significantly different (P < .05) from other groups of the same sex.Next, developmental changes in hebp3 expression in the brain were investigated to determine when, during sexual maturation, the expression was sexually differentiated (Figure 3B). Significant female-biased expression of hebp3 first appeared at the onset of spawning (3 mpf) and persisted during the spawning period.To estimate the magnitude of genetic and hormonal influences on the mechanisms underlying the sexually dimorphic hebp3 expression, we first produced sexually mature XX male and XY female medaka and investigated hebp3 expression in the brain of these sex-reversed fish as well as that of wild-type fish (Figure 4A). XY females exhibited the highest level of hebp3 expression, whereas XX males expressed hebp3 at a low level comparable with that in wild-type XY males.Effects of genetic and hormonal factors on hebp3 expression in the adult medaka brain as revealed by real-time PCR. A, Expression of hebp3 in the brain of sex-reversed, as well as wild-type, sexually mature medaka. Like wild-type XX females (open column), XY females (column with horizontal lines) exhibited a relatively high level of expression, whereas XX males (column with diagonal lines) showed the same low levels of expression as wild-type XY males (filled column) [F (3, 28) = 62.30, P < .0001]. Superscripts with different alphabetical characters are significantly different (P < .05). B, Effects of ovariectomy (OVX) followed by steroid hormone administration on hebp3 expression in the female medaka brain. OVX resulted in a significant reduction in hebp3 expression, when compared with the sham control. Treatment of OVX fish with E2 restored hebp3 expression, whereas this effect was not seen with 11-KT [F (3, 28) = 49.64, P < .0001]. Superscripts with different alphabetical characters are significantly different (P < .05). C, Effects of E2 and 11-KT on the brain hebp3 expression in adult male and female fish with intact gonads. Expression of hebp3 was significantly increased by E2 treatment compared with the untreated control in both males (filled columns) and females (open columns). 11-KT treatment caused a significant decrease in hebp3 expression in females but not in males [males, F (2, 21) = 83.88, P < .0001; females, F (2, 21) = 25.74, P < .0001]. ** P < .01, *** P < .001 compared with the control.We then examined the effects of steroid hormones on hebp3 expression in the brain by using adult females subjected to sham operation, ovariectomy, or ovariectomy plus E2 or 11-KT treatment (Figure 4B). Ovariectomy led to significantly decreased expression of hebp3, and this was completely reversed by treatment with E2, whereas 11-KT had no such effects.The effects of E2 and 11-KT were assessed in male and female adult fish with intact gonads as well (Figure 4C). E2 treatment resulted in a significant increase in the brain hebp3 expression compared with the control (no hormone added) in both sexes. 11-KT treatment caused a significant reduction of hebp3 expression compared with the control in females but had no effect in males.To test the possibility that estrogens exert a direct stimulatory action on hebp3, the expression of ER was assessed in the adult meninges (Figure 5). In both sexes, all 3 ER genes in medaka, esr1, esr2a, and esr2b, were expressed at relatively higher levels in the meninges than in the whole brain with the meninges attached, as was the case for hebp3. No significant sex differences could be detected in ER expression in the meninges. The expression of 2 neuronal markers, nefl and neurod, was hardly detected in the meningeal samples, thereby precluding possible contamination with adherent brain parenchyma.Real-time PCR quantification of ER expression in the adult medaka meninges. Filled columns represent males; open columns represent females. In both sexes, the meninges expressed all 3 ER genes, esr1, esr2a, and esr2b, as well as hebp3, more abundantly than did the whole brain with the meninges attached. There were no significant sex differences in the meningeal expression of any ER subtypes (unpaired t test, esr1, t = 1.550, P = .1961; esr2a, t = 1.418, P = .2293; esr2b, t = 0.8165, P = .4600). Virtually no expression of 2 neuronal markers, nefl and neurod, was detected in the meninges, eliminating the possibility of contamination of the meningeal sample with the brain parenchyma. * P < .05, *** P < .001 between the sexes.We isolated and sequenced the hebp3 locus in the medaka genome (deposited in GenBank with accession no. AB742442) and found that hebp3 was composed of 7 exons and 6 introns spanning a total of 1.4 kb of genome sequence (Figure 6A). The first methionine codon was located at the end of exon 1. The search for possible EREs within the 5′ proximal promoter of hebp3 led to the identification of an imperfect palindromic ERE-like sequence (GGGTCAcacTGACAT), which was conserved in 10 of 12 positions relative to the consensus ERE (AGGTCAnnnTGACCT), at 331-345 bp upstream of the hebp3 transcription start site.Direct transcriptional activation of hebp3 by estrogens via an ERE in the hebp3 proximal promoter region. A, Schematic illustration of the structure of hebp3 and the point mutations made in the ERE-like sequence in the hebp3 promoter. Filled and open boxes represent translated and untranslated exons, respectively, whereas solid lines represent introns and flanking regions. The bent arrow indicates the transcription start site. Point mutations were introduced into the 5′ (Mut-5′), 3′ (Mut-3′), or both (Mut-both) half-sites of the likely ERE. Mutated nucleotides are indicated by reverse type. B, Stimulation of hebp3 promoter activity by E2. HeLa cells were transfected with the hebp3 promoter-luciferase construct (pGL4.10-hebp3) together with the expression construct for Esr1, Esr2a, or Esr2b. The cells were then treated with different concentrations of E2 and the relative luciferase activity was determined. The results demonstrated that E2 stimulated hebp3 promoter activity in a dose-dependent fashion through any subtype of ER [Esr1, F (3, 8) = 8.363, P = .0076; Esr2a, F (3, 8) = 16.37, P = .0009; Esr2b, F (3, 8) = 40.89, P < .0001]. Values are expressed as fold induction compared with unstimulated cells. * P < .05, ** P < .01, *** P < .001 compared with the untreated control. C, Effects of point mutations in the ERE-like sequence on the stimulation of hebp3 promoter activity by E2. HeLa cells were transfected with wild-type or mutated (Mut-5′, Mut-3′, or Mut-both) pGL4.10-hebp3 together with the expression construct for Esr1, Esr2a, or Esr2b. The cells were treated with (filled columns) or without (open columns) E2 and luciferase activity was assayed. The results revealed that both half-sites were required for hebp3 promoter activation by E2 via any subtype of ER [Esr1, F (7, 16) = 84.76, P < .0001; Esr2a, F (7, 16) = 110.5, P < .0001; Esr2b, F (7, 16) = 21.88, P < .0001]. Values are expressed relative to the wild-type construct without E2 stimulation. *** P < .001 between groups with or without E2.Luciferase assays were then performed to assess the ability of estrogens to directly stimulate the hebp3 transcription, using a 1450-bp proximal fragment of hebp3 linked to luciferase. The results demonstrated that E2 induced luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of any of the 3 ER subtypes and that the induction levels somewhat varied, depending on the subtypes of ER involved: Esr1, Esr2a, and Esr2b led to 4.2-, 9.3-, and 8.2-fold induction, respectively, at the maximum concentration of E2 tested (10−7 M) (Figure 6B).We speculated that this estrogen sensitivity of the hebp3 promoter is conferred by the imperfect palindromic ERE-like sequence identified above. To test this idea, point mutations were introduced into either or both the 5′ and 3′ half-sites of this likely ERE within the pGL4.10-hebp3 construct (Figure 6A) and their effects on luciferase activity were determined (Figure 6C). Mutations in both half-sites completely abolished the E2 induction of luciferase activity, indicating that the ERE-like sequence at positions −345 to −331 was functional. Mutations in either half-site also resulted in the complete loss of induction by E2, indicating that the ERE half-site alone was not sufficient to confer E2 responsiveness to the hebp3 promoter.In the present study, we identified a medaka gene with homology to hebp1/hebp2 in other vertebrates by searching for sexually dimorphic genes expressed in the brain. In silico identification of many different hebp1/hebp2-like genomic sequences followed by phylogenetic analysis revealed that the medaka gene identified by differential screening is not orthologous to any known hebp1/hebp2. It represents a new member of this family and was therefore designated hebp3. Importantly, this analysis also revealed that the hebp1/hebp2 family comprises substantially more subfamilies than ever thought before. Differing from a previous phylogenetic analysis (8), which covered only sequences already defined, the present analysis clearly demonstrates that a total of 8 subfamilies, which are now numbered up to hebp8, constitute the hebp1/hebp2 family (we will hereafter simply refer to it as the hebp family). Protein motif analysis indicated that the medaka Hebp3 has a signal peptide. Likewise, all other proteins in the Hebp3, Hebp4, and Hebp5 subfamilies, except the fugu Hebp4 with an incomplete N-terminal sequence, were predicted to have a signal peptide, whereas none in the other subfamilies were. Hebp3, Hebp4, and Hebp5 may thus be secreted proteins, in contrast to Hebp1 and Hebp2, both of which have been shown to be cytoplasmic proteins (5, 6). In view of their potential extracellular modes of action, it is plausible to assume that they play roles substantially different from those of Hebp1 and Hebp2.The results obtained by different approaches clearly showed that, in the adult medaka brain, hebp3 is expressed to a greater extent in females than males. Intriguingly, hebp3 is expressed exclusively in the meninges within the brain, with higher levels in females. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that the meninges are sexually dimorphic tissues. The meninges have traditionally been viewed as specialized membranes that protect the brain parenchyma and reabsorb cerebrospinal fluid. However, there is accumulating evidence that the meninges play critical roles in brain development. They regulate various developmental processes, including the proliferation, migration, differentiation, and maturation of brain cells, by releasing several soluble factors, such as stromal cell-derived factor 1, bone morphogenetic protein 7, and retinoic acid (eg, Refs 24–27). Therefore, it seems possible that Hebp3, as a soluble protein, is also involved in brain development. It should be noted that the teleost brain undergoes neurogenesis over wide areas of the ventricular zones and continues to grow throughout life (28–30), and furthermore, a higher rate of neurogenesis in females than males occurs in the adult medaka brain (our unpublished data). The female-biased expression of hebp3 in the adult meninges may possibly lead to some sexual dimorphism in the adult brain parenchyma by modulating neurogenesis.One may argue that the female-predominant expression of hebp3 in the adult medaka brain represents a transient state in the diurnal and/or reproductive cycle rather than a general property. We showed that females consistently exhibit greater levels of hebp3 expression than males throughout the day. Considering that medaka undergo daily cycles of gametogenesis and spawning, this result indicates that the female-biased expression of hebp3 is neither diurnal nor reproductive cycle specific. Meanwhile, we also found that hebp3 expression in the medaka brain is not sexually differentiated until the onset of spawning, indicating that the female-biased expression of hebp3 is an adult stage-specific characteristic. It may be interesting to note that hebp3 expression in both sexes shows a circadian rhythm, with higher levels during the day. hebp3 may be involved in some behavioral or physiological process with a circadian framework.The question then arises as to the mechanisms that underlie the female-biased expression of hebp3 in the medaka brain. It is known that gonadal hormones influence sexual differentiation of the brain (31–33). At the same time, emerging evidence indicates that some parts of the brain sexually differentiate according to a cell-autonomous genetic program governed by genes on sex chromosomes (34–36). We first evaluated the possible involvement of sex chromosome genes in the female-biased hebp3 expression in the medaka brain by generating and analyzing XX males and XY females. The result was that the expression levels of hebp3 were correlated not with genetic sex but rather with phenotypic sex, indicating that hebp3 expression in the brain is not under the direct control of sex chromosome genes. Instead, the result implies that hormonal factor(s) are the root cause of the female-biased expression of hebp3.A subsequent series of ovariectomy and hormone treatment experiments indeed demonstrated that estrogens derived from the ovary causes hebp3 to be more highly expressed in the female brain than the male brain. This is in good agreement with the observation that the sex difference in hebp3 expression appears concomitantly with sexual maturation. Two opposing modes of action of steroid hormones have been described in the literature to produce sex differences in the brain: either permanent/irreversible or transient/reversible (1, 37). We showed using adult fish that ovariectomy diminished hebp3 expression in females to the same low level as in males, and this could be restored by estrogens, and that estrogens elevated hebp3 expression in males to a comparable level as in females. These results prove that the sex-dependent expression patterns of hebp3 are completely reversible, even in adulthood. It can therefore be concluded that the female-biased expression of hebp3 in the medaka brain relies mostly, if not solely, on the transient/reversible stimulatory action of estrogens derived from the ovary. This is interesting when considering that the teleost brain exhibits a significant degree of sexual plasticity even in adulthood (2, 3). In the brain of rodents, sexually differentiated expression of several genes/proteins possibly underlying sex differences in physiological and behavioral traits stems from the permanent/irreversible action of steroid hormones. These include, for example, galanin, cholecystokinin, substance P, ER, and progestin receptor (38–40). Such a mechanism should cause the brain to sexually differentiate in a permanent and irreversible manner, which is exactly what happens in the rodent brain. Being reversible, unlike these rodent genes/proteins, the sexually dimorphic expression of hebp3 in the medaka brain may contribute to the persistent sexual plasticity of the teleost brain. Although less unlikely because immature fish show no sex differences in hebp3 expression, the possibility remains that steroid action early in life also has some impacts on hebp3. In the present study, we could not examine sex differences of hebp3 expression during embryonic or larval stages due to the difficulty of dissecting the brain from medaka embryos or larvae, and it cannot be ruled out that transient sex differences in hebp3 expression may occur at these stages. Further studies are needed to access the possible contribution of steroid action early in life.On the other hand, curiously, a nonaromatizable androgen, 11-KT, was shown to reduce hebp3 expression in the female medaka brain. Recent data indicate that the medaka ER genes are negatively regulated by androgen signaling (17). Hence, the inhibitory effect of androgen is likely mediated by the suppression of ER expression with consequent reduced estrogen signaling.We further demonstrated that the medaka meninges express all subtypes of ER and estrogens can directly stimulate hebp3 expression through any ER subtypes, strongly suggesting a direct activation of the meningeal hebp3 expression by ovarian estrogens. Evidence was provided that estrogens activate the transcription of hebp3 via an imperfect palindromic ERE at positions −345 to −331 of the hebp3 proximal promoter region, in which both half-sites of the ERE are necessary for this process. Given that GATA1 is the only known factor that regulates the expression of hebp1 (15) and furthermore nothing is known about the regulatory mechanisms for hebp2, our finding should be of importance for understanding the regulation of the hebp family genes. Interestingly, we identified an imperfect palindromic ERE-like sequence in silico in the hebp3 proximal promoter region of zebrafish (ENSDARP00000098458), fugu (scaffold 15), and Tetraodon nigroviridis (ENSTNIP00000021732) as well (data not shown). It thus seems reasonable to suppose that female-biased expression of hebp3 due to direct transcriptional activation by estrogens is conserved across teleost species.In summary, these findings show that hebp3, a new member of the hebp family expressed in the meninges, is a novel transcriptional target of estrogens of ovarian origin and, consequently, is preferentially expressed in females. The reversible sexual dimorphism in the meningeal hebp3 expression may contribute to the development and reversal of sex differences in the teleost brain.We thank Rie Hayakawa-Sekito for technical assistance and the National BioResource Project Medaka for providing the bacterial artificial chromosome clone used in this study.This work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas of The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology in Japan and for Young Scientists of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.Disclosure Summary: The authors have nothing to disclose.digoxygeninestradiol-17βestrogen receptorestrogen-responsive elementexpressed sequence tagheme-binding protein11-ketotestosteronemonths postfertilizationNational BioResource Project.Google ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarOxford University Press is a department of the University of Oxford. It furthers the University's objective of excellence in research, scholarship, and education by publishing worldwideIn vertebrates, maternal transfer of immunity via the eggs or placenta provides offspring with crucial information on prevailing pathogens and parasites. Males contribute little to such transgenerational immune priming, either because they do not share the environment and parasite pressure of the offspring or because sperm are too small for transfer of immunity. In the teleost group of Syngnathids (pipefish, seahorses, and sea dragons), males brood female eggs in a placenta-like structure. Such sex-role-reversed species provide a unique opportunity to test for adaptive plasticity in immune transfer. Here, males and females should both influence offspring immunity. We experimentally tested paternal effects on offspring immunity by examining immune cell proliferation and immune gene expression. Maternal and paternal bacterial exposure induced offspring immune defense 5 weeks after hatching, and this effect persisted in 4-month-old offspring. For several offspring immune traits, double parental exposure (maternal and paternal) enhanced the response, whereas for another group of immune traits, the transgenerational induction already took place if only one parent was exposed. Our study shows that sex role reversal in connection with male pregnancy opens the door for biparental influences on offspring immunity and may represent an additional advantage for the evolution of male pregnancy.Global change is associated with fast and severe alterations of environmental conditions. Superimposed onto existing salinity variations in a semi-enclosed brackish water body such as the Baltic Sea, a decrease in salinity is predicted due to increased precipitation and freshwater inflow. Moreover, we predict that heavy precipitation events will accentuate salinity fluctuations near shore.Here, we investigated how the immune function of the broad-nosed pipefish (Syngnathus typhle), an ecologically important teleost with sex-role reversal, is influenced by experimentally altered salinities (control: 18 PSU, lowered: 6 PSU, increased: 30 PSU) upon infection with bacteria of the genus Vibrio.Salinity changes resulted in increased activity and proliferation of immune cells. However, upon Vibrio infection, individuals at low salinity were unable to mount specific immune response components, both in terms of monocyte and lymphocyte cell proliferation and immune gene expression compared to pipefish kept at ambient salinities. We interpret this as resource allocation trade-off, implying that resources needed for osmoregulation under salinity stress are lacking for subsequent activation of the immune defence upon infection.Our data suggest that composition of small coastal fish communities may change due to elevated environmental stress levels and the incorporated consequences thereof.► We investigated immune function in a coastal fish under a global change scenario. ► Effects of salinity variation on immune cells and immune gene expression were studied. ► Individuals in low salinity delayed the activation the specific immune response. ► Salinity change can result in more time for bacterial replication and a more virulent infection. ► Possibly, resources for osmoregulation under salinity stress are lacking for immune responses.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Learn about our remote access optionsMedaka (Oryzias latipes) is a teleost fish with an XX/XY sex determination system. Recently, it was reported that XX medaka can be sex‐reversed into phenotypic males by exposure to high water temperature (HT) during gonadal sex differentiation, possibly by elevation of cortisol, the major glucocorticoid produced by the interrenal cells in teleosts. Yet, it remains unclear how the elevation of cortisol levels by HT causes female‐to‐male sex reversal. This paper reports that exposure to cortisol or HT after hatching inhibited both the proliferation of female‐type germ cells and the expression of ovarian‐type aromatase (cyp19a1), which encodes a steroidogenic enzyme responsible for the conversion of androgens to estrogens, and induced the expression of gonadal soma‐derived growth factor (gsdf) in XX gonads during gonadal sex differentiation. In contrast, exposure to either cortisol or HT in combination with 17β‐estradiol (E2) did not produce these effects. Moreover, E2 completely rescued cortisol‐ and HT‐induced masculinization of XX medaka. These results strongly suggest that cortisol and HT cause female‐to‐male sex reversal in medaka by suppression of cyp19a1 expression, with a resultant inhibition of estrogen biosynthesis. This mechanism may be common among animals with temperature‐dependent sex determination. Mol. Reprod.

Learn more       The function of AMH (Anti-Müllerian hormone), a phylogenetically ancient member of the TGFβ family of proteins, in lower vertebrates is largely unknown. Previously, we have shown that the gene encoding the type II anti-Müllerian hormone receptor, amhrII, is responsible for excessive germ cell proliferation and male-to-female sex reversal in the medaka hotei mutant. In this study, functional analyses in cultured cells and of other amhrII mutant alleles indicate that lack of AMH signaling causes the hotei phenotype. BrdU incorporation experiments identified the existence of both quiescent and mitotically active germ cells among the self-renewing, type I population of germ cells in the developing gonad. AMH signaling acts in supporting cells to promote the proliferation of mitotically active germ cells but does not trigger quiescent germ cells to proliferate in the developing gonad. Furthermore, we show that the male-to-female sex reversal phenotype in hotei mutants is not a direct consequence of AMH signaling in supporting cells, but is instead mediated by germ cells. Our data demonstrate that interfollicular AMH signaling regulates proliferation at a specific stage of germ cell development, and that this regulation is crucial for the proper manifestation of gonadal sex directed by sex determination genes.Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is a highly conserved member of the TGFβ superfamily of proteins. In mammals, AMH is secreted from supporting cells of the testes (Sertoli cells) and binds to its receptor on the female reproductive primordium, the Müllerian duct. This results in regression of Müllerian duct-derived organs, the oviduct and upper vagina, in males (Behringer et al., 1994; De Santa Barbara et al., 1998; Arango et al., 1999). Although the role of AMH in early testis development is unclear, addition of recombinant AMH can induce mesonephric cell migration, which is crucial for mammalian testis formation and for development of male-specific steroidogenic cells, the Leydig cells (Ross et al., 2003). However, in lower vertebrates, such as teleost fish, the female reproductive primordium does not develop during embryogenesis and male-specific contribution of mesonephric cells to gonad formation is not apparent (Nakamura et al., 2006; Kinoshita et al., 2009). In addition, amh expression is detected in both the female and male developing gonads of fish (Rodriguez-Mari et al., 2005; Klüver et al., 2007). Recently, a medaka mutant with excess germ cells and male-to-female sex reversal was isolated (Morinaga et al., 2004). The gene underlying the hotei mutant phenotype was identified as AMH type II receptor (amhrII) (Morinaga et al., 2007), but the cellular mechanism underlying the phenotype has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we report the cellular mechanism of germ cell and sex regulation by AMH signaling during gonadal development by analyzing of the hotei mutant phenotype.The wild-type cab strain, hotei mutants (Morinaga et al., 2007) and sox9b-EGFP transgenic medaka (Nakamura et al., 2008) were used for this study. Isolation of tilling medaka was performed as previously described (Taniguchi et al., 2006).For genotyping the hotei and amhrIIK87X allele, a Custom TaqMan SNP genotyping assay (ABI) was used. Primers for the hotei allele were: hotei_SNP F (5′-CCTGAACAACAGCTCCTTCCT-3′), hotei_SNP R (5′-AGCGCATCCATATTTCCCACAAT-3′), hotei_VIC (5′-CCGACATCTACGCCTTG-3′) and hotei_FAM (5′-CGACATCTGCGCCTTG-3′). Primers for the amhrIIK87X allele were: K87X_F (5′-TGCGGTAAAGTGGAAACCTTATGT-3′), K87X_R (5′-GCGATTTTGAAGGCGTGGTT-3′), K87X_VIC (5′-CAACCTGCAAGGTAC-3′) and K87X_FAM (5′-TGCAACCTGCTAGGTAC-3′).To genotype the amhrIISD and amhrIIQ89X alleles, RFLP analysis was used. The genomic fragments were amplified by the following primers: amhrII tilling forward (5′-CACTCATCTGCTGGTAATGT-3′) and amhrII tilling reverse (5′-CATAACAATTTTACACCGTT-3′). PCR products were digested with RsaI (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA).WT-AMHRII del-AMHRII and hot-AMHRII (Y390C hotei mutation) constructs were prepared as previously described (Belville et al., 2009). P19 cells were co-transfected with Gal4-Smad1, Gal4-luc and different mutant cDNA expression vectors. AMH (10 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium for 24 hours. Firefly and renilla luciferase activities were assessed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Dual Luciferase kit, Promega). Results were normalized to renilla luciferase activity.In situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and histology were performed as previously described (Nakamura et al., 2006). For immunohistochemistry, primary antibodies used were anti-OLVAS (1:100, rat or rabbit) (Aoki et al., 2008), anti-BrdU (1:100, mouse, Sigma) and anti-GFP (1:100, rat, Nacalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan).BrdU incorporation analysis was performed as previously described (Nakamura et al., 2010). BrdU-positive single isolated germ cells were counted as self-renewing germ cells (type I), while clusters with more than two germ cells were counted as germ cells undergoing type II division. We counted the number of BrdU-positive type II clusters; for example, a two-cell cyst or 16-cell cyst was counted as one cluster.Transplantation from hotei XY (donor) to wild-type XY (host) embryos and from wild-type XY (donor) to hotei XY (host) embryos was performed as previously described (Nakamura et al., 2012). Biotin-dextran was injected in the donor-derived cells and detected by Alexa-conjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes).As described previously (Kurokawa et al., 2007), 2000 ng/μl cxcr4b morpholino with EGFP-olvas 3′UTR RNA was injected into the fertilized eggs of the hotei mutant. The germ cell-deficient embryos were screened by EGFP fluorescence and raised to adulthood.The isolation of total RNA and RT-PCR were performed previously (Kurokawa et al., 2007). For RT-PCR of amhrII, the following primers were used: amhrII f873 (5′-gaaaacaccctcagc-3′) and amhrII r1257 (5′-ctttgataaatcagagca-3′).In hotei mutants, the gene encoding the type II receptor for anti-Müllerian hormone (amhrII) contains a Tyr-to-Cys substitution at position 390 (Y390C) in the highly conserved kinase domain (Morinaga et al., 2007). To test the function of the hotei mutation, we conducted in vitro reporter assays using P19 cells, which possess all the AMH signaling components, except for a type II receptor (Belville et al., 2009). When a wild-type human AMHRII cDNA construct was co-transfected with the Gal4-luciferase reporter and Smad1-Gal4 fusion constructs into P19 cells, AMH was able to induce luciferase expression. By contrast, when human cDNA constructs encoding hot-AMHRII, which contains the Y to C point mutation, and del-AMHRII, in which the kinase domain is deleted, were co-transfected into P19 cells, no increase in luciferase activity was observed (Fig. 1A). hot-AMHRII and del-AMHRII mutant proteins were expressed at similar levels in the transfected cells, as assessed by western blotting (data not shown). These results indicate that the hotei mutant AMHRII receptor cannot mediate AMH signaling.Lack of AMH signaling causes excessive proliferation of germ cells during gonadal differentiation.

Scale bars: 50 μm in B; 20 μm in D.To further confirm that loss of AMHRII function underlies the hotei mutant phenotype, we have isolated three additional medaka amhrII tilling mutants. The mutant alleles lack the conserved kinase domain, the transmembrane domain and part of the receptor domain, and, in terms of the structure, are probably unable to mediate AMH signaling in cells (supplementary material Fig. S2A). Indeed, these mutants display hotei-like phenotypes, with excess germ cells and some XY mutants exhibiting complete sex reversal to female (supplementary material Table S1; Fig. S2B-E). Together with the cell culture experiments, these results indicate that the hotei mutant phenotype results from a lack of intracellular AMH signaling.Next, we examined the course of germ cell proliferation in both wild-type and mutant gonads. At stage 36, there is no significant difference in germ cell number between wild-type and mutant gonads (Fig. 1C). By stage 39 (8 days post-fertilization), the number of germ cells was increased in both XX and XY mutant gonads (Fig. 1B,C). The timing of germ cell expansion was consistent with the onset of amh expression (Nakamura et al., 2006). As this phenotype was observed in all four mutants, the hotei mutant was used hereafter for detailed analyses.In developing medaka gonads, there are two types of germ cells: a self-renewing type that undergoes type I division and is important for germ cell maintenance, and a cystic type that undergoes type II division and is committed to gametogenesis. Female developing gonads have more germ cells due to the transition of germ cell division from type I to type II (supplementary material Fig. S1B) (Saito et al., 2007). At stage 39, the number of germ cells undergoing type I division was significantly increased in the gonads of both XX and XY hotei mutants compared with that in wild-type gonads (Fig. 1D). BrdU pulse labeling (Fig. 1E) revealed that the number of self-renewing germ cells in S phase at stage 39 is about threefold higher in hotei mutants (hot XX, 19.7±3.9, n=7; hot XY, 14.6±2.3, n=9) than that in wild type (wild-type XX, 5.8±0.8, n=7; wild-type XY, 5.1±2.1, n=7). In the hotei XY gonad, we found that the cystic type II division occurs precociously (Fig. 1D), an early indication of sex reversal of an XY gonad into an ovary. Interestingly, the number of the germ cell clusters with type II cystic division at S phase does not differ between hotei XY and wild-type XX gonads (approximately five type II germ cell clusters per gonad) (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, the ratio of type II germ cells at S phase to the total number of type II germ cells does not significantly differ among wild-type XX, hotei XY and hotei XX gonads at stage 39 (Fig. 1F). These results indicate that the type I division is principally affected in the hotei mutant. In other words, the excessive number of germ cells in both sexes of the hotei mutant is primarily due to overproliferation of self-renewing germ cells. As there was no difference found in the number of cystic germ cell clusters at S phase between hotei and wild-type gonads (Fig. 1E), AMH signaling may not regulate the transition from type I to type II divisions.In the adult medaka ovary, germline stem cells are found in the Gs population of germ cells (Nakamura et al., 2010). The Gs population comprises two types of germ cells with different cell cycle length: fast-dividing (Gsf) and slow-dividing (Gss) germ cells. We hypothesized that self-renewing type I germ cells in the developing gonad also contain mitotically active and quiescent germ cells. To test this, the wild-type embryos at stage 36 (6 dpf) were incubated with BrdU for 48 or 72 hours. We found that, in each gonad, eight to ten self-renewing germ cells failed to incorporate BrdU in both sexes (Fig. 2A,C,E,F; data not shown), whereas cystic germ cells undergoing type II division in the XX gonad were all BrdU positive. Thus, self-renewing germ cells in the developing gonad includes a mitotically quiescent subpopulation that is clearly distinct from the mitotically active subpopulation. Surprisingly, the number of BrdU-negative germ cells does not differ significantly between wild-type and hotei mutant gonads (Fig. 2F). Together with our data on the number of germ cells and our cell cycle analysis (Fig. 1D,E), this suggests that AMH signaling in the developing gonad regulates the proliferation of mitotically active, self-renewing germ cells, but does not induce quiescent germ cells to enter mitosis.Proliferation of mitotically active germ cells but not quiescent germ cells is accelerated in the hotei mutant. (A-E) Ventral views of wild-type (A,C,E) and hotei (B,D) gonads at 9 dpf (stage 40), immunostained with OLVAS (blue), GFP (green) and BrdU (red) antibodies after 72 hours of BrdU exposure from 6 dpf (stage 36). GFP marks sox9b-expressing supporting cells. BrdU-negative germ cells (arrows) exist only among the self-renewing type I germ cells in both wild-type and hotei gonads, even after long-term BrdU exposure. A higher magnification view is shown in E. Scale bars: 20 μm in A-D; 10 μm in E. (F) The number of BrdU-negative germ cells after 72 hours of BrdU exposure from 6 dpf (stage 36). No significant difference was observed (one-way ANOVA). Open circles indicate each sample. Red squares and bars show the mean±s.e.m. Scale bars: 20 μm in A-D; 10 μm in E.To confirm previous amh and amhrII expression data (Nakamura et al., 2006; Klüver et al., 2007; Morinaga et al., 2007), we performed double in situ hybridization and showed that both amh and amhrII are expressed in supporting cells, but not in germ cells, in both sexes during early gonad differentiation (supplementary material Fig. S3). This suggests that AMH signaling acts in sox9b-expressing supporting cells. To exclude the possibility that undetectable levels of amh and/or amhrII expression in germ cells affect germ cell proliferation, we generated germline chimeras. hotei mutant XY germ cells in host wild-type XY gonads failed to undergo cystic division characteristic of the XY hotei phenotype at stage 39 (n=3; Fig. 3A,B). However, when wild-type XY germ cells were transplanted into host hotei XY gonads, the donor-derived germ cells underwent type II cystic division, with some differentiating into meiotic oocytes, which are never observed in wild-type XY gonads at this stage (n=3; Fig. 3C,D; data not shown). These results demonstrate that AMH signaling does not directly act on germ cell proliferation. Rather, interfollicular AMH signaling controls germ cell proliferation via unknown signals.AMH signaling does not act directly on germ cell proliferation. (A-D) The germline chimeric gonads at stage 39 stained by OLVAS antibody for germ cells (green) and streptavidin Alexa 568 (red) for biotin-dextran in donor-derived germ cells. When hotei homozygous XY donor germ cells (broken lines in A and B) were in the wild-type XY host gonad, the donor cells did not proliferate (A,B). By contrast, wild-type donor germ cells (broken lines in C and D) proliferate actively in the hotei XY host gonad (C,D). Scale bars: 50 μm.Approximately half of the hotei XY mutants showed male-to-female sex reversal, as assessed by secondary sex characteristics (e.g. fins), gonad morphology and gene expression (Fig. 4A; supplementary material Table S2) (Morinaga et al., 2007). One possible explanation for this phenotype is that loss of AMH signaling results in a direct initiation of sex reversal events in other, non-germline, cell types. Another possibility is that sex reversal in hotei mutants is not a direct consequence of a supporting cell defect, but instead is mediated by the excessive number of germ cells. The latter model is supported by our previous work showing that germ cells are essential for differentiation of the undifferentiated gonad into an ovary in wild-type XX medaka. The absence of germ cells causes complete masculinization, with male-specific gene expression and male secondary sex characteristics (Kurokawa et al., 2007).Male-to-female sex reversal in hotei mutant depends on the presence of germ cells.

(C) Model of AMH signaling in germ cell proliferation.To determine which is accurate, we generated germ cell-deficient hotei mutants (Kurokawa et al., 2006; Kurokawa et al., 2007). None of the XY hotei mutants lacking germ cells exhibited female sex reversal, as judged by secondary sex characteristics and gene expression (Fig. 4A; supplementary material Table S2). These results indicate that the male-to-female sex reversal in the XY hotei mutant is not a direct consequence of impaired AMH signaling in the sox9b-expressing supporting cells, but probably stems from precocious expansion of germ cells. Consistent with this, somatic cells expressed female makers, such as foxl2 and a gene encoding an estrogen-producing enzyme, aromatase (cyp19a1), at 20 dph (days post hatching) in the hotei mutant (Fig. 4A,B) (Morinaga et al., 2007).Interestingly, we noticed that several genes involved in masculinization of gonads, such as DMY/dmrt1bY and a male steroid hormone-producing genes, P45011β, were also expressed in the sox9b-expressing supporting cells of the XY hotei feminized gonad (Fig. 4A,B). As the mutant XY developing gonad has oocytes and is anticipated to form an ovary, germ cells are required not only for development and maintenance of the female gonad, but are also likely to have an antagonistic effect on male development, possibly by expressing a female-promoting or a male-repressing factor.In this study, we found that AMH signaling functions in the somatic cells of both sexes and regulates the proliferation of mitotically active, self-renewing, type I germ cells (Fig. 4C). Loss of this signaling results in hyperproliferation. We also revealed the presence of a quiescent type of type I germ cells that are not affected by the AMH signaling. The intra- and intercellular signaling regulated by AMH signaling to control germ cell proliferation will be the next important target to further understand gonad development in medaka.We thank Y.

It was experimented recently to understand the effect and mechanism on mono sex production in Poecilia latipinna. It would help to develop a new eco-friendly way to masculinize P. latipinna, since males have higher commercial value than females. The different concentration (100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 mg/L) of T. terrestris extract and a control were tested for their effect on sex transformation/reversal in P. latipinna by immersing the newly born young ones in the respective concentrations for 2 mo. The obtained results indicate that a dose dependant masculinization is obtained due to T. terrestris administration, which improved the male proportion. Histological results revealed that the testes of fish treated with T. terrestris extract contained all stages of spermatogenesis, clearly demonstrating that the administration of T. terrestris extract to P. latipinna stimulated spermatogenesis. Thus, it is discernible that 0-d-old hatchlings of P. latipinna exposed to T. terrestris extract orient/reverse their sex more towards maleness besides yielding better growth and spermatogenesis which is a mandate for fancy fish industry.This is a preview of subscription content, log in to check access.Adaikan P.

However, sox9 is up-regulated in the male gonads in a number of species in which it is the essential regulator of testis determination. It is therefore often discussed that the sex determining gene-sox9 axis functions in several vertebrates. In our current study, we show that sox9b in the medaka (Oryzias latipes) is one of the orthologues of mammalian Sox9 at syntenic and expression levels. Medaka sox9b affects the organization of extracellular matrices, which represents a conserved role of sox9, but does not directly regulate testis determination. We made this determination via gene expression and phenotype analyses of medaka with different copy numbers of sox9b. Sox9b is involved in promoting cellular associations and is indispensible for the proper proliferation and survival of germ cells in both female and male medaka gonads. Medaka mutants that lack sox9b function exhibit a seemingly paradoxical phenotype of sex reversal to male. This is explained by a reduction in the germ cell number associated with aberrant extracellular matrices. Together with its identified roles in other vertebrate gonads, a testis-determining role for Sox9 in mammals is likely to have been neofunctionalized and appended to its conserved role in germ cell maintenance.Citation: Nakamura S, Watakabe I, Nishimura T, Toyoda A, Taniguchi Y, Tanaka M (2012) Analysis of Medaka sox9 Orthologue Reveals a Conserved Role in Germ Cell Maintenance.

Among the mammalian Sox family, Sox9 has been extensively analyzed and is known to be critical for many aspects of cell differentiation such as chondrocyte specification, neural crest differentiation, heart valve development and male sex determination [1]–[4]. Many of these functions are achieved through the role of sox9 in the extracellular matrix and this has been confirmed in various vertebrates. This suggests that sox9 is conserved both structurally and functionally.During the initial events in sex determination, many vertebrates employ a species-specific sex determining gene. In mammals, the sex determining gene, Sry, is on the Y chromosome and directly upregulates the transcription of Sox9 in the supporting cells of the XY gonad only. Once Sox9 expression is established in the XY supporting cells, it is both functionally required and sufficient for testis determination [5]–[9]. In other higher animals, such as the chicken, alligator and turtle, sox9 is also up-regulated exclusively in the male gonad [10]–[12]. In lower vertebrates, the role of sox9 in the gonad is not yet known. It has been often described that a sex determining gene-sox9 axis may constitute a conserved component of the sex determination system in many vertebrates.The medaka (Oryzias latipes) is a species of teleost fish and represents a good model system for studying the conserved mechanisms of sex determination and the differentiation of gonads across different vertebrate species [13]. Male sex determination in the medaka is initiated in the supporting cells via the expression of the DM-domain gene on the Y chromosome, DMY/dmrt1bY [14], [15]. However, the involvement of the medaka sox9 homologue in DMY/dmrt1bY-involving testis determination has not yet been functionally addressed.As a result of teleost-specific genome duplication [16], most genes in teleosts are present in two copies. Two sox9 genes have also been reported in the medaka genome, sox9a and sox9b/sox9a2 (hereafter referred to as sox9b) [17]–[19]. Among these two copies, sox9a is not expressed in the gonadal supporting cells essential for sex determination, but is expressed in oocytes of the adult ovary [19]. In contrast, sox9b initiates its expression in the gonadal precursor cells that develop into the supporting cells [20]. It is therefore thought that the expression of sox9b in the supporting cells of the medaka parallels the role of mammalian Sox9 in the gonads.Our previous examinations have revealed that unlike mammalian gonads, sox9b expression in the medaka is maintained in a few supporting cells in the developing ovary. In addition, the histological units of sox9b-expressing supporting cells in medaka have been recently identified as ovarian niche structures (known as the germinal cradles) that contain germline stem cells [21]. These expression patterns led us to speculate that the role of medaka sox9b may differ from that of mammalian Sox9 during testis determination.Using syntenic and gene expression analysis in our current study, we first reconfirmed that medaka sox9a and sox9b are co-orthologues of mammalian Sox9 and that sox9b, but not sox9a, is expressed in the supporting cells responsible for initiation of medaka testis determination [17], [22]. Using both transgenic and chimeric sox9b medaka mutants, we show that medaka sox9b is required for germ cell proliferation and survival, but not for testis determination. The expression of components of the extracellular matrix was found to be largely disorganized in sox9b mutant medaka gonads. In addition, our results show that zebrafish sox9a is also expressed in the ovarian supporting cells. These findings collectively challenge the discussion along with the mammalian Sox9 function in the gonads and suggest that a testis determining role is an appended function during vertebrate evolution.To confirm the phylogenetic relationships between medaka sox9a and sox9b with other vertebrate sox9 genes, we first examined the sox9 synteny among representative vertebrates using the Ensemble genomic information (Fig. S1A). As expected from previous analysis [17], the genomic region around sox9 is conserved in the mouse, chick and frog (Xenous tropicalis) and is duplicated in the teleosts stickleback, medaka and zebrafish. The two regions in the teleosts contain either sox9a or sox9b. Other than these two genes, no other sox9-like gene could be found using whole genome scanning. In addition to these observations, the main Sox9 expression domains in mammalian embryos have been shown to correspond to both or either sox9a and/or sox9b in teleost embryos. Hence, sox9a and sox9b in teleosts are very likely to be the only co-orthologues of the sox9 gene in other vertebrates [17], [22].Our current expression analysis demonstrated that medaka sox9a is not expressed in the somatic cells during gonadal differentiation (sox9a, XY n = 5, XX n = 5). Sox9b was only detected in the supporting cells surrounding the germ cells (sox9b, XY n = 5, XX n = 5) (Fig. S1B), as expected from previous reports [18]–[20]. These results may be supportive of the conventional view that medaka sox9b has a conserved role in sex determination in the supporting cells within the medaka sex determining gene pathway. However, unlike mammalian Sox9 which is expressed in male supporting cells only, medaka sox9b is also expressed in the female developing gonads [20]. Additionally, in the adult ovary, sox9b-expressing supporting cells constitute niche structures harboring germline stem cells [21].To evaluate whether the female expression of sox9 is specific to the medaka, we examined the gonadal sox9a and sox9b expression patterns of a phylogenetically distant teleost, the zebrafish. The previous reports indicate that zebrafish sox9a is expressed in the male supporting cells in adult testes (Fig. S2C) [22], [23]. Our present in situ hybridization analyses revealed that zebrafish sox9a expression occurs in some populations of somatic cells surrounding the small germ cells in the adult ovaries (Fig. S2A, S2B) while zebrafish sox9b was found to be expressed in the oocytes of adult ovaries but not in the testes (Fig. S2D, S2E). The expression analysis, suggests that there is functionally conserved similarity between medaka sox9b and zebrafish sox9a in gonads. This, together with our syntenic analysis, supports the previous report by Klüver et al that medaka sox9a and sox9b are an example of lineage-specific subfunctionalization and have arisen from duplication of the ancestral proto-chromosome 2 [17]. We next conducted functional analysis of the medaka sox9b gene to reveal a possible conserved role in teleost gonads.To address the function of sox9b in medaka gonads, we isolated two nonsense mutant alleles, sox9bK16X and sox9bK136X from the medaka tilling library (Fig. 1A, 1B) [24]. These variants have nonsense mutations in the 5′ coding region and HMG box domain, respectively. Western blotting analysis further revealed that the sox9b protein product levels are absent in the homozygous mutants (Fig. 1C), indicating that both of the nonsense alleles are functionally null. The heterozygous mutants of both alleles were found to be viable and to reach sexual maturity, although their reproductive ability was low. However, both the sox9bK16X and sox9bK136X homozygous mutants died by 20 dph (days post hatching) which is approximately 28 dpf (days post fertilization).(A) Schematic representation of the sox9b medaka protein and the locations of mutations. (B) Genomic sequences of wild-type sox9b, and of the sox9bK16X (−/−) and sox9bK136X (−/−) mutants. (C) Western blotting analysis of sox9b and alpha-tubulin demonstrating the absence of expression in the homozygous mutants, confirming that both alleles are null.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029982.g001In order to address the possible involvement of sox9b in sex determination, the expression of sex markers were examined in early stages of gonadal development. GSDF [25] and DMRT1 [20] are typical of male supporting cell markers. In our current experiments, both markers were found to be expressed in all of the homozygous XY gonads examined, but not in the XX gonads (Fig. 2A–H). The female marker, aromatase, is known to be expressed only in female somatic gonadal cells including female-specific theca cells [26]. In contrast to GSDF and DMRT1, aromatase was detectable only in XX gonads (Fig. 2I–L). Hence, the genes involved in early sex differentiation in medaka are not regulated by sox9b, and sex differentiation therefore proceeds normally at these stages in the sox9b mutants.(A–L) GSDF (A–D), DMRT1 (E–H) and aromatase (I–L) expression (blue) were detected by in situ hybridization analysis of st. 39 (A–D) and 10 dph (E–L) medaka embryos, respectively. Consistent with the pattern found in wild-type (WT) medaka gonads, GSDF and DMRT1 were found to be expressed in XY gonads of the homozygous sox9b mutants, whilst aromatase was expressed in XX gonads of the homozygous sox9b mutants. More than five gonads were examined in each experiment. Dotted lines (A–L), gonadal outlines; asterisks in (A–D), germ cells. Scale bar, 10 µm (A–D); 20 µm (E–L).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029982.g002In the adult heterozygous mutants, the size of ovaries and testes is decreased due to the reduced numbers of germ cells (Fig. S3A–C). We often found the gonads without germ cells (Fig. S3D), revealing a loss of germline maintenance. Interestingly, heterozygous XX mutants often exhibited male secondary sex characteristics (Fig. S3B and S3C) with gonads morphologically comparable to wild-type testes. In these sex-reversed mutants, a testis-marker gene, P45011β, is upregulated in the gonad while the expressions of ovarian marker genes, foxl2 and aromatase, were not detected by PCR. Other gonadal markers, which express in both testis and ovary, were detected normally as those in the wild-type gonad (Fig. S3E). The sex reversal phenotype was completely rescued by one copy of sox9b transgene in the heterozygous mutant background (Table 1). The heterozygous mutants with female secondary sex characteristics possessed the gonads with ovarian structures having the reduced number of germ cells (Fig. S3B and S3C). We did not observe the sex reversal event that was anticipated given the homology between mammalian Sox9 and medaka sox9b. We also observed no feminization of heterozygous XY mutants (a half-dose of functional sox9b) and no masculinization of transgenic XX medaka with an additional sox9b-transgene (Table 1), clearly supporting that sox9b is not involved in masculinization.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029982.t001Very interestingly the compound mutant mice with Sox8 and Sox9 revealed a phenotype of gradual loss of germ cells [27]. Therefore with suspect of the conserved sox9 function on germ cell regulation, we focused on the germ cells in the medaka sox9b mutants.In wild-type medaka, the gonads exhibit proliferation of the germ cells with more of these cells found in females as sex differentiation proceeds [28], [29]. At stage 34 (4 dpf) when the gonadal primordium is established with germ cells, no differences were found in the total numbers of germ cells in both wild-type and sox9bK16X and sox9bK136X mutant medaka (Fig. 3E and Fig. S4). However, the germ cells in the sox9bK16X and sox9bK136X mutant gonads did not increase much at the later stages in either sex. This difference is detectable as early as stage 39 (8 dpf) and becomes more apparent at 10 dph (Fig. 3). The total numbers of germ cells were significantly reduced in these mutants when compared with the wild-type medaka (Fig. 3E). The sexual differences in the germ cell number typically seen in wild-type gonads were also observed in the heterozygous mutants (Fig. 3E and Fig. S4). This indicates that germ cell proliferation and/or survival is affected in sox9b mutants.(A–D) Ventral images of the medaka gonad at 10 dph obtained by confocal microscopy. Germ cells and nuclei were stained with an anti-OLVAS antibody (purple) and DAPI (green), respectively. The tissue structures are formed but the germ cell numbers are reduced in the mutant gonads.

All values are the mean ± SEM. Scale bars, 50 µm.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029982.g003We next characterized the germ cell proliferation modes in the sox9b medaka mutants. During the early stages of sex differentiation in the wild-type medaka, there are two modes of germ cell proliferation in operation. The type I mode ensures germ cell maintenance (including stem cell proliferation) which is histologically indicated by the presence of isolated germ cells. Type II proliferation occurs in germ cells that are committed to gametogenesis and involves successive cell divisions. This mode of proliferation results in tightly packed cyst-forming germ cells (Fig. 4A). The female-specific increase in germ cells after the initiation of DMY/dmrt1bY expression is the consequence of a sub-population of germ cells shifting from type I to type II proliferation [29].(A) Medaka exhibit two modes of germ cell division during the early stages of gonadal differentiation. Intermittent divisions (type I) lead to germ cell maintenance and occur in both males and females, whilst synchronous and successive divisions (type II) form germ cell-cysts that are committed to gametogenesis. Type II divisions occur in developing female gonads and cause a female-specific rapid increase in germ cell number. Germ cells undergoing type I or II divisions are identifiable by the presence of isolated (arrows) or packed germ cells (brackets), respectively. (B) In the sox9b mutants, germ cells undergoing both type I and II divisions were reduced in number. Cysts containing more than two germ cells were counted as undergoing type II divisions. (C and D) Representative images of EdU labeling experiments in wild-type and mutant medaka gonads at stage 39 are shown. Note that the nuclei of type I germ cells are positively labeled by EdU (yellow) in wild-type (arrows) but not in mutant medaka. Germ cells were stained with an anti-OLVAS antibody (purple). (E) The percentage of EdU-positive type I germ cells was calculated, and type I divisions responsible for germ cell maintenance found to be significantly impaired in the mutants. All values are the mean ± SEM. *P<0.05 student's t test (each value was compared with wild-type XY and XX, respectively). Scale bar, 50 µm.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029982.g004The numbers of isolated and cystic germ cells were found not to be increased in the sox9bK16X and sox9bK136X medaka mutants during sex differentiation (Fig. 4B). Importantly, we observed that the commitment of germ cells to gametogenesis was not impaired in these mutants as clusters of germ cells undergoing type II division, although quite rare though, were detectable (Fig. 4B). The reduced proliferative activity of type I germ cells was confirmed in the mutants using an EdU incorporation experiment (Fig. 4C–E). Moreover, type I and type II germ cells in the mutant gonads showed frequent apoptosis, as detected by cleaved-caspase3 expression (Fig. 5 and Table 2). Hence, the germ cells in sox9bK16X and sox9bK136X mutants demonstrate reduced survival and proliferation. A similar tendency but less severe phenotype was observed in the heterozygous mutants (Fig. 3E, Fig. 4E and Fig. S4).(A–H) Ventral views of 10 dph medaka gonads immunostained with anti-OLVAS (germ cell marker, purple) and anti-cleaved caspase 3 (blue). Merged images (A, C, E and G) and cleaved caspase 3 signals (B, D, F and H) are shown. Low levels of germ cell apoptosis only were evident in wild-type XY and XX medaka at 10 dph. However, type I and type II germ cells (type I, arrows; type II, a bracket) were eliminated by apoptosis (Table 2) in the homozygous (E and F) and heterozygous (G and H) mutants. Scale bar, 50 µm.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029982.g005https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029982.t002We often observed that the sox9b-expressing supporting cells in the sox9bK16X and sox9bK136X mutants exhibited aberrant shapes with frequent blebs and incomplete ensheathment (Fig. 6A–F), suggesting an impairment of cell to cell associations leading to abnormal germ cell homeostasis. To further evaluate these effects, chimeric gonads containing both wild-type and mutant cells were generated via transplantation. In contrast to chimeric gonads between wild-type cells, mutant sox9b-expressing supporting cells tended to be expelled from the chimeric gonads (Fig. 6G–K). The frequency of contact between sox9b-expressing supporting cells and germ cells was found to be dramatically decreased (Fig. 6L). In addition, homozygous mutant cells exhibited a more severe phenotype than heterozygous mutant cells, indicating that this severity depends on the functional sox9b gene dose per supporting cell. Since mutant sox9b-expressing supporting cells retain the ability to form gonads, the phenotype of the chimeric gonads can be attributed to a reduced capability of the mutant sox9b-expressing supporting cells to associate with each other, but not to a loss of identity of the supporting cells.(A–F) The morphologies of wild-type (A and B) and mutant (C–F) medaka gonads.

Medaka germ cells are completely surrounded by sox9b-expressing supporting cells and demonstrate a smooth surface (B), whilst mutant sox9b-expressing cells have cytoplasmic protrusions (D, arrows). Some isolated germ cells were not completely surrounded by sox9b-expressing cells in the mutants (F, asterisks). This was not seen in wild-type animals.

Scale bar, 50 µm.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029982.g006A number of studies have attributed many aspects of Sox9-involving phenomena to the regulation of extracellular matrices [1], [4], [30]. In medaka, we observed that laminin deposition was abnormal in the sox9b mutant gonad (Fig. 7A–D) whereas the tissues expressing both sox9a and sox9b do not show this defect (Fig. 7E, 7F). Furthermore, the expression of other extracellular matrix components, such as collagen genes and MMP genes, were found to be altered in mutant embryos, testes and ovaries (Fig. 7G–I). Hence, the observed impairment of cellular associations via the disorganization of extracellular matrix components is consistent with the failure of germ cell maintenance in medaka sox9b mutants, although further analysis needs to be done to fully elucidate these pathways.(A–D′) Ventral views of wild-type and sox9bK16X−/− medaka gonads at stage 39. Laminin (red), sox9b-EGFP (green) and germ cells detected by OLVAS antibody (blue) are shown.

The intensity of each band was normalized to EF1α and the relative expression levels compared with wild type are shown. Note that some ECM components and MMP are upregulated or downregulated in mutants compared with wild type. Each value represents the mean ± s.e.m. (n = 4). Scale bars, 20 µm and 100 µm (E–F′).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029982.g007The seemingly paradoxical masculinization of the medaka sox9b mutants is consistent with the germ cell-loss phenotype found in adult mutant gonads because our previous analysis has indicated that gonadal somatic cells, in the absence of germ cells, are predisposed to male development (Fig. S3F) [31], [32]. In contrast, the hotei homozygous mutant has a defect in the gene expressing the type II receptor for the anti-Müllerian hormone (amhrII) and shows continuous proliferation of germ cells [33]. Since the receptor and the ligand (anti-Müllerian hormone) are both expressed in the supporting cells but not in the germ cells, the impairment of anti-Müllerian hormone system consequently causes the germ cell-excessive phenotype. The homozygous hotei mutants show the male to female sex reversal phenotype but the sex reversal is not observed in the heterozygous hotei mutants. In this context, the number of germ cells in the gonad affects the proper sex differentiation directed by the sex chromosomes, and wild-type XX medaka without germ cells develop male secondary sex characteristics with a male gene expression profile (Fig. S3F).To further obtain the solid evidence that the masculinization in sox9b mutants is a secondary effect of the decreasing number of germ cells, we crossed a sox9b mutant with a hotei heterozygous mutant to recover the germ cell number. We found that the number of germ cells is recovered and that the female to male sex reversal phenotype of the sox9b heterozygous XX mutants was abolished completely in the hotei and sox9b compound heterozygous mutants (Table 3). This result indicates that the female to male sex reversal phenotype of the sox9b mutants is caused by a decreased number of germ cells and not by a direct impairment of sox9b-expressing supporting cells. Taken together with the gene expression analysis and the analysis of medaka containing different doses of functional sox9b gene, we conclude that medaka sox9b is not required for testis determination or the subsequent processes of early testis differentiation.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029982.t003We find in our current study that the medaka sox9b gene does not directly regulate testis determination and differentiation in this teleost species but is involved in germline maintenance and survival in both female and male gonads. The combined expression domains of medaka and zebrafish sox9a and sox9b largely match those of mouse Sox9, suggesting that the conserved sox9 roles among vertebrates are divided between two sox9 genes in medaka as a result of teleost-specific genome duplication. Medaka heterozygous sox9b mutants are viable and a few homozygous mutants can survive until 20 dph. This is in contrast to the embryonic lethality seen in the Sox9-disrupted mouse embryo. The discrepancy in these survival outcomes between medaka and mouse could be attributable to the redundant expression of sox9a and sox9b in the medaka.During chondrogenesis, mammalian Sox9 directly regulates the expression of Col2a1, the extracellular matrix component type II collagen gene [34]. In mouse chimeras, Sox9−/− mesenchyme cells are excluded from wild-type cells during cartilage formation, possibly due to a disorganized extracellular matrix [35]. It is intriguing that a gradual loss of germ cells has been reported in the compound Sox8 and Sox9 mutant mouse and concluded to be the result of functionally defective supporting cells caused by the loss of Sox8 and 9 redundant activity [27]. This is a representative example of the germ cell maintenance role of Sox9 in mammalian gonads. Our present results show that the germ cell-loss in our medaka sox9b mutants are likely to have been caused by reduced cellular associations. The results of these studies are therefore collectively supportive of an evolutionally conserved role of sox9 in the regulation of germ cell maintenance and survival. In this context, both medaka sox9a and sox9b seem to have a redundant role on the regulation of extracellular matrix because the laminin deposition in the pectoral fin was not impaired in the sox9b mutants (Fig. 7E, 7F).Interestingly, medaka sox9b mutants show a female to male sex reversal phenotype, which is the opposite effect of the masculinizing function of Sox9 in the mammalian gonads. Our current results demonstrate that the masculinization caused by the loss of sox9b function is accounted for by a decreased number of germ cells. Recent comparative genomic approaches have revealed that testis-specific enhancer of Sox9 core element (TESCO), which is a binding region for Sry and is critical for the male-specific expression of Sox9 in supporting cells in the mouse, is conserved in amniotes and amphibia (Xenopus tropicalis), but not in the medaka or zebrafish [36]. This provides a fascinating view that TESCO-mediated regulation was utilized by the evolutional stem from amphibia and was then recruited to mediate the testis-determining function of Sox9 in parallel with the emergence of Sry in mammals. This possibility is consistent with our current data showing that a sex determining gene-sox9 axis does not underpin sex determination in medaka and suggests that Sox9 is likely to play a neofunctionalized role in testis determination in mammals, which is appended to the more conserved sox9 role in germ cell maintenance.It is also of interest that the loss of Sox9 expression in mammalian female supporting cells may be related to the lack of premeiotic germ cells in the adult ovary. This would explain why germline stem cells are either absent or very few in number in the mammalian ovary and also the species-specific configuration of gonadal differentiation.In conclusion, the molecular pathways in medaka that start with DMY/dmrt1bY represent a unique system of testis determination and differentiation and should prompt a reconsideration of the discussion regarding the sox9-dependent testis determination system in many vertebrates.All the treatments of animals in this research followed the guideline of National Institute for Basic Biology and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of National Institutes of Natural Sciences. The approval IDs by the committee are 11A094 and 10A023.The wild-type cab strain, Sox9b-EGFP/DsRed transgenic medaka [20], [37] and hotei mutants [33] were used in this study. Isolation of tilling medaka was performed as previously described by Taniguchi et al. [24]. The region encompassing the first and second exons of the medaka sox9b gene, including the initial ATG, was screened for mutations using the primers 5′-AACTCTTGGACGCAGAAAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCAGGGTGCAAACGGATAAC-3′ (reverse). The PCR products were treated with ExoSAP-IT (GE Healthcare) and sequenced using the forward primer and a 3730xl 96-capillary DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Two different alleles (K16X and K136X) were identified, as shown in Figure 1A. Medaka that are homozygous for the K16X or K136X alleles die by 20 dph (days post hatching).The sex of the fish (XY or XX) was determined by PCR genotyping using a previously described method to detect polymorphisms between dmy and DMRT1 [20]. To genotype the sox9b alleles (+/−, +/− or −/−), direct sequencing and/or SNP genotyping assays were performed. For direct sequencing, genomic regions encompassing the mutation sites were amplified by PCR using the primers; sox9b tilling F 5′-GGGCTCCAACTCTTGGACGC-3′ and sox9b tilling R 5′-CAATAAAACCTCGTGCGCCG-3′. After removing dNTPs by ExoSAP-IT (USB), amplified fragments were used as templates and subjected to sequencing by PCR with the forward or reverse primers described above. Sample sequences are shown in Figure 1B. Genotyping of sox9b mutant alleles was also performed using a custom SNP genotyping assay (Applied Biosystems) and a real time PCR system (StepOne; Applied Biosystems). The following primers and TaqMan probes were used for the SNP genotyping assay:Sox9bK16Xseq_sox9b_F 5′-CCTCGATCCATACCTGAAGATGACA-3′seq_sox9b_R 5′-ACTGGGAGCGTCGGAGT-3′seq_sox9b_VIC 5′-VIC-AAGAACAGGAGAAGTGTC-3′ (wild type)seq_sox9b_FAM 5′-FAM-AAGAACAGGAGTAGTGTC-3′ (mutant)Sox9bK136Xseq_sox9b_F 5′-CCAATACCCGCATTTGCACAAC-3′seq_sox9b_R 5′-GGGCTTACCTCCAAAGTTTTCCA-3′seq_sox9b_VIC 5′-VIC-AGCTCAGCAAAACT-3′ (wild type)seq_sox9b_FAM 5′-FAM-CAGAGCTCAGCTAAACT-3′ (mutant)Western blotting was performed as described previously [38]. Briefly, after SNP genotyping using the fins of sox9bK16X and sox9bK16X offspring at stage 39, each embryo (+/+, +/− and −/−) was crushed and boiled in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% SDS). Following centrifugation, the supernatant was used for western blotting. Anti-Sox9b serum was raised in rabbits immunized with a sox9b peptide (RAQYDYSDHQNSANS). Anti-sox9b serum (rabbit, 1/500) and an alpha tubulin antibody (mouse, 1/4000; Sigma) were used as the primary antibodies. The secondary antibodies used included anti-rabbit HRP (1/2000; Zymed) and anti-mouse HRP (1/2000; Nacalai).In situ hybridization (ISH), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and histology were performed as previously described [39]. Sox9bK16X and sox9bK16X siblings were collected and fixed with 4% PFA at stage 34, stage 39 and 10 dph. For ISH, a medaka GSDF clone (NCBI accession number; FS532259) was obtained from the NBRP Medaka cDNA library (http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/medaka/top/top.jsp) and used as the RNA probe. RNA probes for DMRT1 and aromatase were prepared as described previously [20], [26]. Zebrafish sox9a and sox9b probes were gifts from Dr. C. Chung and were prepared as described [22]. Genetic sex and sox9b genotypes were determined after ISH. Transverse plastic sections (4 µm) were also prepared as described [39]. For IHC, anti-GFP (1/100, rat; Nacalai or 1/100, mouse; Clontech), anti-DsRed (1/100, rabbit; Clontech), anti-OLVAS (1/100, rat) [38], anti-cleaved caspase3 (1/100, rabbit; Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-laminin (1/100, rabbit; SIGMA) were used as the primary antibodies followed by incubation with Alexa 488, 568 or 647 coupled secondary antibodies (1/100, goat; Molecular Probes).Germ cell proliferation was assessed using the Click-iT EdU labeling kit (Invitrogen). Embryos of sox9bK16X and sox9bK16X offspring at stage 39 were exposed to 500 µM EdU/BSS (Balanced Salt Solution) for 1 h and then fixed in 4% PFA. Detection of EdU was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. After genotyping, IHC using anti-OLVAS (rat, 1/100) and anti-rat Alexa 488 (1/100; Molecular Probes) was performed. Embryos were counterstained with DAPI and EdU positive germ cells/all germ cells ratios were determined in both the wild type and mutants.Medaka embryos from wild-type sox9b-DsRed and the sox9bK16X (+/−)/sox9b-EGFP incross were used as the host and donor, respectively. To mark the donor cells, 1% fluorescent dextran (Fluroruby; Molecular Probes) was microinjected into donor embryos at the one cell stage. Donor and host embryos at the mid-blastula stage were dechorionated in a solution containing hatching enzyme (obtained from NBRP medaka) for 30 min. Pipettes for transplantation were prepared by pulling 1 mm glass capillary tubes using a PC-10 puller (Narishige). Using a pipette installed on an oil-driven manipulator (CellTram Vario; Eppendorf), the labeled donor cells were transferred into the dechorionated mid-blastula stage host embryos on an 0.8% agar plate filled with 0.9% BSS (balanced salt solution). One day after transplantation, donor embryos were genotyped to distinguish +/+, +/− or −/−. Chimeric embryos were incubated up to stage 39 and fixed in 4% PFA. IHC was performed using anti-GFP (rat, 1/100; Nacalai), anti-DsRed (rabbit, 1/100; Clontech) and anti-OLVAS (rat, 1/100) antibodies.The sox9b coding sequence lacking its stop codon (Sox9b CDS) was inserted into the SalI site of the pBLSK+ PTV1-2A-mCherry vector [40], (a gift of Dr. Hibi; Nagoya University), upstream of the 2A peptide. The resulting sox9b CDS- PTV1-2A -mCherry DNA fragment was then inserted by homologous recombination into a previously described BAC clone containing the entire sox9b gene [20], [37]. This modified BAC was then injected into fertilized eggs of the OKcab strain and two independent stable lines were obtained. One line was used for rescue experiments by crossing with sox9b mutants. The Sox9b transgene copy numbers were determined by qPCR with THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR Mix (TOYOBO) using primers for sox9b and dmy (one copy control). The following primers were used for qPCR;q-sox9b-F, 5′-TTCCTTACGCACGATCCTCA-3′;q-sox9b-R, 5′-TTCGATCTTTCACTGGTTTGC-3′;q-dmy-F, 5′-CTCCGGTAAATTGACGCACA-3′;q-dmy-R, 5′-GTCTGACTTTCCGGTCAAAGG-3′.RT-PCR was performed as previously described [38]. Briefly, total RNA from the ovaries or testes of wild type or sox9b heterozygous mutants was isolated by ISOGEN (Nippon Gene). After removing genomic DNA by treatment with DNase I (Ambion), single stranded cDNA was synthesized from 300 ng total RNA using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). The PCR reactions were performed using the primers described above [31].Total RNA was prepared from wild-type or sox9b mutant embryos, adult testes and ovaries using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene) or RNAqueous (Ambion). After removal of the genomic DNA by treatment with DNase I (Ambion), cDNA was prepared from a 300 ng aliquot of total RNA using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and used for subsequent qPCR analysis. qPCR. was performed using the Thunderbird SYBR qPCR mix (Toyobo) and StepOne (ABI) and the primers col2a1a F, 5′- GGCAACAGCCGCTTTACTTA -3′ and col2a1a R, 5′- AATGTCCACAATGGGCAAAC -3′; col2a1b F, 5′- GGTAACAGCCGCTTCACCTA -3′ and col2a1b R, 5′- AATGTCCATGGGAGCAATGT -3′; laminin α2 F, 5′- CCCAATCTACGTGGGAGGAT -3′ and laminin α2 R, 5′- GTCTTTGACGCCTTGGTGAT -3′; MMP13 F, 5′- AGGTCGATGCTGCTGCTTAC -3′ and MMP13 R, 5′- GCATTCAAGGATGGAGTTGG -3′; MMP9 F, 5′- TTGACAAAGGCTACCCCAAG -3′ and MMP9 R, 5′- CCGCCAGTAGAATTGGTCAC -3′; EF1α F, 5′- CATGGTTGTGGAGCCTTTCT -3′ and EF1α R, 5′- CTTTCTCTGCAGCCTTGGTC -3′.Syntenic analysis and expression study of medaka sox9 genes.

Wild-type XY medaka display a jagged dorsal fin and a sharp anal fin, which is typical male secondary sex characteristics. Round-shaped dorsal and anal fins and a developed urinogenital papilla (arrows) are characteristic of wild-type XX medaka. Alleles (K16X or K136X), genetic sex (XY or XX) and phenotypic sex (male or female) are indicated on the left of each panel (B and C). Some XX heterozygous mutants showed female to male sex reversal for both secondary sex characteristics and gonad morphology (middle panels in B and C). (D) A representative image of a germ cell-deficient gonad in an XX heterozygous medaka mutant. This mutant exhibited male secondary sex characteristics. (E) Expression of several sex-related genes assessed by RT-PCR in wild-type and heterozygous mutant gonads. The gene expression patterns in the gonads of XX male heterozygous mutants are consistent with those of the wild-type XY gonads. (F) The sex of the medaka is determined by the presence or absence of the Y chromosome. However sex differentiation requires proper homeostasis of the germ cells. Germ cell-deficient medaka exhibit female to male sex reversal of secondary sex characteristics independently of the genetic sex. Fewer germ cells are inclined to produce a male phenotype whereas hypertrophic germ cells, as in the hotei mutant, cause a male to female sex-reversal phenotype. Female to male sex reversal in heterozygous sox9b mutants is explained by the secondary effects of a reduced number of germ cells but not by the direct effects of sox9b-expressing cell impairment.

163–176(2012)Cite this article3213 Accesses73 Citations8 AltmetricMetricsDMRT1, which is found in many vertebrates, exhibits testis-specific expression during the sexual differentiation period, suggesting a conserved function of DMRT1 in the testicular development of vertebrate gonads. However, functional analyses have been reported only in mammals. The current study focused on the Dmrt1 function in the teleost medaka, Oryzias latipes, which has an XX–XY sex determination system. Although medaka sex is determined by the presence or absence of the Y chromosome-specific gene Dmy, we demonstrated that in one Dmrt1 mutant line, which was found by screening a gene-driven mutagenesis library, XY mutants developed into normal females and laid eggs. Histological analyses of this mutant revealed that the XY mutant gonads first developed into the normal testis type. However, the gonads transdifferentiated into the ovary type. The mutant phenotype could be rescued by transgenesis of the Dmrt1 genomic region. These results show that Dmrt1 is essential to maintain testis differentiation after Dmy-triggered male differentiation pathway.A DM domain gene, DMRT1 (doublesex- and mab-3-related transcription factor 1), is required for human testis development (Raymond et al. 1999). In mice, Dmrt1 is expressed and required for both the germ cells and the Sertoli cells of the testes (Kim et al. 2007; Krentz et al. 2009; Matson et al. 2010). XY Dmrt1-null mutant mice are born as males with testes, but these gonads later undergo abnormal differentiation (Raymond et al. 2000). The avian Z-linked DMRT1 is required for male sex determination in chickens (Smith et al. 2009). It is also involved in male development in other vertebrates including turtles, frogs, and teleost fish. The two sex-determining genes found in non-mammalian vertebrates, Dmy in medaka (Matsuda et al. 2002; Matsuda et al. 2007) and DM-W in the African frog (Yoshimoto et al. 2008; Yoshimoto et al. 2010), are Dmrt1 homologues.The teleost fish medaka Oryzias latipes has an XX–XY male heterogametic sex determination system like mammals. The key factor that recruits the bipotential gonad with the XY chromosome constitution to the testicular pathway was identified as being a DM-domain-related gene on the Y chromosome, namely Dmy or dmrt1bY (Matsuda et al. 2002, Nanda et al. 2002). Dmy mRNA and protein are expressed specifically in the somatic cells surrounding germ cells in the early gonadal primordium before morphological sexual dimorphism is observed. The first morphological sexual dimorphism is observed in the proliferation of germ cells. Therefore, the number of germ cells is an important indicator for distinguishing a bipotential gonad recruitment to the testicular or ovarian pathway in the early developmental stages.In an inbred Hd-rR strain, the sexual dimorphism of germ cells between the XX and XY gonads has been apparent at stage 38; subsequently, germ cells entered mitotic arrest in XY (Satoh and Egami 1972; Kobayashi et al. 2004), whereas they entered meiosis in XX after hatching. Dmy dysfunction leads to complete male-to-female sex reversal. XY fish of Dmy mutants or with low-level expression of Dmy have developed to egg-laying females (Matsuda et al. 2002; Shinomiya et al. 2004; Otake et al. 2006). Furthermore, the germ cells in the hatching stage of the embryos that have been blocked for Dmy translation by Dmy-specific grip-NA become female-like (Paul-Prasanth et al. 2006). These results suggest that XY gonads with blocked Dmy function commit to the female pathway.In medaka, Dmrt1 is expressed in spermatogonium-supporting cells, which is the same lineage cells expressing Dmy, after testicular differentiation (20–30 days after hatching) (Kobayashi et al. 2004). In the case of medaka, high-temperature treatment or steroid hormone treatment can induce XX sex reversal (Yamamoto 1958; Sato et al. 2005; Hattori et al. 2007). This means that a gonad lacking Dmy can develop into testis and that Dmy is not necessary for testicular development. Dmy works as a natural inducer for normal testicular development. Dmrt1 appears to be a key gene in normal testicular development because in steroid hormone treatment-induced XX sex-reversed testes, Dmrt1 is expressed in the Sertoli cell lineage, similar to the expression of Dmy in XY testes (Kobayashi et al. 2004). High temperatures have also induced Dmrt1 expression in XX embryos (Hattori et al. 2007). However, it remains unclear whether Dmrt1 is necessary for testicular development in medaka.To examine Dmrt1 function in the gonadal development of medaka, we screened an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-based gene-driven mutagenesis library of medaka and found Dmrt1 mutants. In one Dmrt1 mutant line, XY individuals showed a male-to-female sex-reversal phenotype. The XY mutants developed into normal egg-laying females. Histological analyses of the developing gonads in the mutants revealed that by 10 days after hatching, the gonads of the XY mutants had already commenced development along the female pathway.Two laboratory strains of medaka were used: the Cab strain and the inbred strain Hd-rR. The Cab strain was used to establish an ENU-based gene-driven mutagenesis library of medaka. The Cab strain is a sub-strain of the Carbio strain, which was established from fish obtained from Carolina Biological Supplies. Founder fish were repeatedly mutagenized with ENU and crossed with wild-type females, and the progeny were used to establish a permanently cryopreserved resource of 5,771 F1 males (Taniguchi et al. 2006; Ishikawa et al. 2010). The Hd-rR strain was used for back-crossing and as a control in the gene expression analyses.A gene-driven mutagenesis library has sets of frozen sperm and genomic DNA that were prepared from 5,771 F1 males. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products of the Dmrt1 exon 2 region of 5,600 stock DNAs within 5,771 were screened using high resolution melting (HRM) analysis and sequencing. PrimeSTAR® Max DNA Polymerase (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) was used as a DNA polymerase, and 0.83× LCGreen Plus (J. K. International, Tokyo, Japan) and 10% dimethylsulfoxide were added to the PCR reaction mix with the following primers: DM29f: 5′-CTG TAC AAG TGA ACC CCG CCT-3′ and DM30r: 5′-GCG GTG TTT TGT TCG GTG-3′. PCR conditions were as follows: 5 min at 95°C followed by 30 cycles of 20 s at 96°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 30 s at 72°C, followed by 5 min at 72°C; and a final denaturing and re-annealing step (one cycle of 94°C for 30 s followed by rapid cooling to 28°C). The final step was included to redistribute DNA strands derived from mutant and wild-type alleles to maximize heteroduplex formation. After PCR, the plates were imaged in a 96-well LightScanner (Idaho Technology Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA) for HRM analyses as previously described (Taniguchi et al. 2006; Ishikawa et al. 2010).The genomic DNAs showing melting curves that differed from those of the wild-type allele were selected as mutant candidates. The selected genomic DNA were purified using an ExoSAP-IT (General Electronics, Fairfield, CT, USA) and then used as a template for the sequencing reaction. The BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with the primer 5′-GAA CCA CGG CTT CGT GTC T-3′ was used for sequencing, which was performed using a 3100 genetic analyzer (Life Technologies Corporation).The genetic sex of each specimen was determined using genomic PCR using the common primers for Dmrt1 and Dmy (Shinomiya et al. 2004). We used two methods to distinguish between the Dmrt1 mutant alleles and the wild-type alleles. The first method was direct sequencing of the PCR product. We amplified the Dmrt1 genomic region using the DM29f and DM30r primers, and the PCR products were purified using ExoSAP-IT (General Electronics). The sequencing methods are described above. The other method was genotyping the Dmrt1 C53R mutation using the TaqMan® probe and the ABI PRISM 7500 (Life Technologies Corporation) with the Multiplex PCR Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) using the DM29f and DM30r primers and the TaqMan® probe 5′-FAM-CTG CCG CTG CGC CA-TAMRA-3′ (2.0 μM), which was specific for the wild-type allele, and the VIC-TAMRA probe 5′-VIC-TGC CGC CGC GCC A-TAMRA-3′ (1.6 μM), which was specific for the mutant allele. PCR conditions were as follows: 15 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 60 s at 60°C.The mating scheme for the Dmrt1 C53R lines is shown in Fig. 1. The G1 generation was produced by in vitro fertilization of normal eggs with frozen sperm. Further, the G2 generation was produced by sib-mating between heterozygous individuals from the G1 generation. A homozygous XY mutant (C53R/C53R) of the G2 generation that developed as a female was crossed with an inbred Hd-rR male to produce the G3 generation. XY heterozygous individuals from the G3 generation were again back-crossed with Hd-rR. In the G4 generation, heterozygous males and females were sib-mated to obtain the G5 generation.Mating scheme. The mating scheme of Dmrt1 C53R mutants. Details are provided in the “Materials and methods” section. The G2, G5, G10, and G11 generations were used for the histological analyses. The G11 generation was also used for gene expression analyses. The G′8 generation was used for the transgenic rescue experimentAn XX female with a genomic homozygous mutation (C53R/C53R) was crossed with an Hd-rR XY male to obtain the G6 generation in which two types of mating were performed to obtain two distinct lines. The first line was used for back-crossing. A heterozygous XY of the G6 generation was back-crossed with Hd-rR XX. Further, backcrosses were repeated two times. Heterozygous females of the G9 generation were then mated with heterozygous males of the G9 generation to obtain various combinations of Dmrt1 and sex chromosome types of G10 offspring for histological analyses 5 days after hatching. Homozygous XX from the resultant G10 generation were crossed with heterozygous XY to obtain many mutant individuals for gene expression and histological analyses.The other line was used to obtain all XY progeny for a transgenic rescue experiment. To this end, we mated mutant XY G5 females with heterozygous XY G6 males. Select heterozygous (+/C53R) YY males were crossed with homozygous (C53R/C53R) XX females derived from the G10 generation of a back-crossed line to obtain all of the XY eggs for the microinjection.For histological analysis of the gonads and counting of the germ cells, fish were dissected into head and body segments 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 days after hatching. Body segments containing gonads were fixed for 3 h in Bouin’s reagent and then embedded in paraffin. On the other hand, each dissected head was used for DNA extraction and genotyping according to the protocol listed in the “Genotyping” section. Cross-sections were cut serially at 5-μm thicknesses and subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining. All germ cells were counted for each fry at 5 days after hatching. After cell counting, the mean and standard error were calculated for each sex and the difference between the sexes was statistically evaluated using the paired t test.To analyze testis- or ovary-specific gene expression, we extracted RNAs from Dmrt1 C53R and wild-type (Hd-rR) individuals. Whole bodies of each individuals at the day of hatching or the gonads of each individuals dissected at 30 days after hatching were put into a 1.5-mL tube (ASSIST, Tokyo, Japan) with 300 μL Buffer RLT (QIAGEN) and two zirconia beads with 3-mm diameters. They were homogenized in Micro Smash™ MS-100 (TOMY SEIKO CO., LTD, Tokyo, Japan) and then centrifuged for 3 min at 18,800×g in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was used for the RNA extraction, while the pellet was used for DNA extraction for genotyping. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Extracted RNA (200 ng of total RNA) was reverse-transcribed using a QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN).Dmy was amplified with the following primers (Otake et al. 2006): 5′-TGC CGG AAC CAC AGC TTG AAG ACC-3′ and 5′-GCA TCT GCT GGT ACT GCT GGT AGT TG-3′. The PCR conditions were as follows: 5 min at 95°C, followed by 45 cycles of 20 s at 96°C, 30 s at 65°C, and 30 s at 72°C, followed by 5 min at 72°C. We analyzed the Dmy PCR products using the MultiNA Microchip Electrophoresis System (SHIMAZU, Kyoto, Japan). Quantitative gene expression analysis of the gonadal soma-derived factor (Gsdf) was performed using the ABI PRISM 7500 (Life Technologies Corporation) and QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kits (QIAGEN) following the protocols of Shibata et al. (2010). Dmy and Dmrt1 at 30 days after hatching were amplified using the following primers: 5′-CTG ACA TGA GCA AGG AGA AGC AG-3′ and 5′-CGC TTG TGG CCT TTC AGC-3′. PCR conditions were as follows: 5 min at 95°C, followed by 30 cycles of 20 s at 96°C, 30 s at 65°C, and 30 s at 72°C, followed by 5 min at 72°C. PCR products were analyzed by using 3% agarose gel electrophoresis. Foxl2 and Cyp19a1 were amplified using the following primers: Foxl2, 5′-CGC CAC AGC AAA GCT CG-3′ and 5′-TCG AGT GTC CAG TAA TTC CCC T-3′; and Cyp19a1, 5′-TGT GCT CAT TGT TGC TTG CAT C-3′ and 5′-TAA TGC AAA ACA TTT GAT GAA TAA CAG TTC-3′. The PCR conditions were as follows: 5 min at 95°C, followed by 30 cycles of 20 s at 96°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 30 s at 72°C, followed by 5 min at 72°C. The Foxl2 PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel, and the Cyp19a1 PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel.The transgene constructs for generation of the Dmrt1 transgenic fish were prepared by sub-cloning the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone mCON075P1 containing the Dmrt1 genomic region. We replaced the original BAC clone vector pBAC-lac backbone with the pCC1 vector (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI, USA). The pCC1 vector contains two types of replication origins. Under normal conditions, a single copy of this vector is present in a bacterium, whereas multiple copies are present in a bacterium in culture medium with induction solution. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used as a fluorescent reporter under the control of the medaka olvas promoter (Tanaka et al. 2001). We constructed a recombinant plasmid where vasa-GFP was inserted into the pCC1 vector in an earlier study (Otake et al. 2010). In the present study, we amplified this region using PCR and the following primer sets: 5′-TAG CGA TGA GCT CGG ACT TCC ATT GTT CA-3′ and 5′-CGT AAT CAT GGT CAT AGC TGT TTC CTG TGT-3′. The PrimeSTAR® Max DNA Polymerase (TakaraBio Inc.) was used for the PCR reaction, and the conditions were as follows: 5 min at 96°C, followed by 35 cycles of 10 s at 98°C, 5 s at 55°C, and 65 s at 72°C, followed by 3 min at 72°C. We joined the BAC clone to the amplified fragment using a Red/ET BAC Modification Kit (GeneBridge, Heidelberg, Germany), which enables the insertion of large sequences into BAC clones by homologous recombination.TransforMax EPI300 electro-competent cells (Epicentre Technologies) were used for the transformation. Recombinant clones were cultured and induced by the addition of the CopyControl Induction Solution (Epicentre Technologies) to generate high plasmid copy numbers, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The clones were purified using CsCl–ethidium bromide gradient ultracentrifugation. The BAC was injected into medaka single-cell-staged embryos of a cross between Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XX females and Dmrt1 +/C53R YY males. Fertilized eggs were collected within 40 min of spawning. The attaching filaments were scraped off the chorion onto a piece of paper. For microinjection of the recombinant BAC clone, we used DNA at 2.0 ng/μL in Yamamoto’s solution. The injected eggs were incubated at 26°C.We screened 5,600 stock DNAs of a gene-driven mutagenesis medaka library. A 278-bp PCR fragment of the Dmrt1 gene containing a 5′-untranslated region (47 bp), a translated region (207 bp), and an intron region (24 bp) was analyzed by HRM and sequencing. Four stock DNAs contained mutations in the translated region (Fig. 2a). Frozen sperm corresponding with the each stock DNA artificially fertilized normal eggs to obtain the G1 generation. Heterozygous G1 males and females were mated to obtain G2 homozygous mutants.Dmrt1 mutations. a The mutation positions on the DM domain in Dmrt1 exon 2. Four missense mutations were found: P22L, F35S, C53R, and C56R. Asterisks show the conserved cysteine and histidine residues thought to be important in the zinc-finger motif. The gray arrowhead shows the mutated position. The chromatogram of a wild-type individual showed one peak for thymine in amino acid 53 (b), that of the heterozygous individual (Dmrt1+/C53R) showed a double peak of cytosine and thymine (c), and that of the homozygous mutant (Dmrt1C53R/C53R) showed one peak of cytosine (d)We histologically analyzed gonads of these G2 homozygous mutants (Table 1). In two mutant lines (Dmrt1 P22L and Dmrt1 F45S), we could not find differences with normal gonads in either sex. In another mutant line (Dmrt1 C56R), the XY mutants had abnormal gonads. Most of them developed as males, but their testes contained a few oocytes, whereas a few of them developed female-like appearances and their gonads had many oocytes but no ovarian ducts and they did not lay eggs (Table 1).In the other line (Dmrt1 C53R), both XX and XY mutants had abnormal gonads with a low number of germ cells. We assumed that the phenotypes were dependent on other mutated loci located near the Dmrt1. Therefore, we bred >100 offspring to obtain recombinants between the locus and Dmrt1. We then found that one XY homozygous mutant and two XX homozygous mutants developed into egg-laying females. The XY mutant was mated to the Hd-rR strain to obtain heterozygous individuals (Fig. 1). The heterozygous individuals were then saved for the next generation. We then histologically analyzed the gonads of the G5 generation obtained by mating heterozygous males with females. All of the XY homozygous mutants had ovaries. On the other hand, other combinations of sex chromosome type and Dmrt1 alleles had normal gonads depending on the sex chromosome type (Table 2). The Dmrt1 mutation was confirmed by genomic DNA sequencing (Fig. 2b–d).The genetic males (XY) of the Dmrt1 C53R/C53R mutants developed into females. Therefore, to clarify when sex reversal occurs during gonadal differentiation, we histologically analyzed the gonadal phenotypes of the Dmrt1 C53R mutants at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 days after hatching (Fig. 3, Table 3). At 5 days after hatching, we used the G10 generation obtained by sib-mating the heterozygous (Dmrt1 +/C53R) individuals from the G9 generation, whereas at 10, 15, 20, and 30 days after hatching, we used the G11 generation obtained by sib-mating the homozygous XX females (Dmrt1 C53R/C53R) with the Dmrt1 +/C53R XY males from the G10 generation. Before obtaining the G9 generation, we back-crossed the homozygous (Dmrt1 C53R/C53R) or heterozygous (Dmrt1 +/C53R) individuals six times with the Hd-rR strain to replace the genomic background with the inbred strain (Fig. 1). In a gene-driven mutagenesis library, it has been calculated that each sperm has approximately 2,300 ENU-induced mutations per genome (Taniguchi et al. 2006; Ishikawa et al. 2010). Furthermore, the mutagenesis library has been made using the Cab strain. We found some XX males in this strain.Histological analyses of the Dmrt1 C53R mutant gonads. The number of germ cells in the Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY gonads resembled that in the wild-type (Dmrt1 +/+) XY gonads (*P < 0.01) at 5 days after hatching (a). The gonads at 5 (b–e), 10 (f–i), 15 (j–m), 20 (n–q), and 30 days (r–u) after hatching. The Dmrt1 +/C53R and Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XX gonads were the ovary type. The Dmrt1 +/C53R XY gonads were the testis type; however, the Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY gonads were the testis type at 5 days after hatching but were the ovary type and contained oocytes at 10, 15, 20, and 30 days after hatching. Black arrowheads indicate gonial-type germ cells; white arrowheads indicate various sizes of oocytes at the diplotene stage. n nephric duct, g gut, ed efferent duct. Scale bar = 40 μmMedaka germ cells become sexually dimorphic at stage 38, 2 days before hatching (Kobayashi et al. 2004). After hatching, the germ cells in the XY gonad (male type) enter mitotic arrest, whereas the germ cells in the XX gonad (female type) proliferate and enter meiosis (Satoh and Egami 1972). Therefore, testicular morphogenesis is distinct from ovarian morphogenesis at 5 days after hatching in normal medaka development. Germ cell numbers at 5 days after hatching differed significantly between the XY and XX individuals; however, there were no significant differences between germ cell numbers in the Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY mutants and those in the wild-type XY individuals (Fig. 3a).Histological analyses also demonstrated significant differences between the XY and XX gonads at 5 days after hatching (Table 3, Fig. 3b–e). XX gonads contained gonial germ cells and oocytes, whereas XY gonads contained only gonial germ cells. At 10 days after hatching, both heterozygous (Dmrt1 +/C53R) and mutant (Dmrt1 C53R/C53R) XX gonads were similar to the ovary type seen in normal development. These gonads contained gonial germ cells and numerous oocytes at different developing stages in which the most advanced oocytes had entered the diplotene stage of meiotic prophase (Fig. 3f, g). Conversely, all of the Dmrt1 +/C53R XY gonads (N = 5) were similar to the developing testis in normal development (Fig. 3h), whereas the Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY gonads (N = 5) were similar to the developing ovary in normal development (Fig. 3i). At 15, 20, and 30 days after hatching, the XX and Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY gonads were observed to be normally developing ovaries filled with many oocytes at various stages of the diplotene stage, with oocytes at the zygotene and pachytene stages and gonial germ cells (Fig. 3j–k, m–o, q–s, u). On the other hand, the Dmrt1 +/C53R XY gonads, which contained gonial germ cells and somatic cells, were similar to the testis type seen in normal development (Fig. 3l, p, t). The somatic cells at 20 and 30 days after hatching formed testis-specific structures—efferent ducts. The Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY gonads appeared to have fewer oocytes than did the XX gonads.All homozygous XY mutants developed into egg-laying females, while all heterozygous XY mutants developed into males. By mating these females with males, we could obtain YY individuals containing heterozygous and homozygous mutants in the Dmrt1 locus. The heterozygous YY individuals developed into male with male secondary sexual characteristics and produced sperm, whereas homozygous YY mutants did not have male secondary sexual characteristics and did not lay eggs. The gonads of homozygous YY mutants contained a few developing oocytes without ovarian cavity (data not shown).Next, we analyzed the gene expression profile of testis- and ovary-specific genes on the day of hatching and 30 days after hatching (Fig. 4). On the day of hatching, the expression of the testis-specific genes Dmy and Gsdf was examined by reverse transcriptase (RT)–PCR and real-time quantitative RT–PCR. All XY individuals expressed Dmy, but XX individuals did not (Fig. 4a). The relative mRNA expression level of Gsdf in the Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY embryos was lower than that in the wild-type XY embryos but higher than that in all of the XX embryos (Fig. 4b).Gene expression analyses of the Dmrt1 C53R mutants. a Expression of Dmy immediately after embryo hatching.

The black arrowhead shows the upper marker, which is used to correct the moving distance of DNA fragments with lower marker, which is the lower position (not shown), in the MultiNA system. The white arrowhead indicates the positions of the Dmy fragments. b The relative mRNA expression of Gsdf in the Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY embryos immediately after hatching was lower than that in the wild-type (Hd-rR) XY embryos but higher than that in all the XX embryos. c Dmrt1 and Dmy expression in the gonads at 30 days after hatching. Dmrt1 expression was detected in all samples. However, wild-type (Hd-rR) XX and Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY gonads showed lesser expression than did the wild-type (Hd-rR) XY and Dmrt1 +/C53R XY gonads. Conversely, Dmy expression was detected only in XY gonads. However, the Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY mutant gonad showed stronger expression than did the other wild-type and Dmrt1 +/C53R XY gonads. The expression of Foxl2 (d) and Cyp19a1 (e). At 30 days after hatching, the PCR products of ovary-specific genes were detected in the Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY gonads and wild-type XX gonads but not in the Dmrt1 +/C53R XY or wild-type XY gonadsAt 30 days after hatching, the expression of the testis-specific genes Dmy and Dmrt1 and the ovary-specific genes Foxl2 and Cyp19a1 were also examined by RT–PCR. The Dmrt1 expression was detected in all samples (Fig. 4c). Wild-type (Dmrt1 +/+) XX and mutant (Dmrt1 C53R/C53R) XY gonads showed lesser expression than did the wild-type XY and heterozygous (Dmrt1 +/C53R) XY gonads. Conversely, Dmy expression was detected in only XY gonads. Moreover, the Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY gonads showed higher expression than did the other wild-type and Dmrt1 +/C53R XY gonads. The wild-type XX gonads expressed both the ovary-specific genes, whereas the expression of these genes was undetectable in the wild-type XY gonads and in the Dmrt1 +/C53R XY gonads (Fig. 4d, e). However, the Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY gonads expressed both the ovary-specific genes (Fig. 4d, e).To determine whether the sex reversal of the Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY mutants was caused by the Dmrt1 C53R mutation, we inserted an exogenous Dmrt1 gene regulated by its own promoter into the genome of Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY mutant embryos. To this end, we constructed a recombinant BAC clone containing the medaka Dmrt1 genomic region derived from an inbred Hd-rR strain and vasa-GFP driven by a medaka germ cell-specific olvas promoter (Tanaka et al. 2001) as a fluorescent reporter gene (Fig. 5a). The BAC was injected into medaka single-cell-staged embryos of a cross between Dmrt1 +/C53R YY males and Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XX females. The Dmrt1 +/C53R YY male was obtained by crossing Dmrt1 +/C53R XY males with Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY females (Fig. 5b). We obtained one germline-transmitting founder in the F0 generation, a Dmrt1 +/C53R XY male. The F0 XY was crossed with a Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XX female to obtain the F1 generation. In the F1 generation, 10 XY individuals and six XX individuals inherited the exogenous Dmrt1.Transgenic rescue experiment of Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY mutants. The structure of the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone containing the Dmrt1 genomic region, which encompasses 35 kb of a six-exon region, 80 kb of the upstream region, and 30 kb of the downstream region (a). A pCC1 vector fragment encoding vasa-green fluorescent protein and a kanamycin resistance gene was replaced in the pBAC-lac vector region of the BAC construct using a homologous recombination system. The Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY mutants carrying the transgene developed into males. The Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY mutants have female secondary sexual characteristics (b), whereas the Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY mutants carrying the transgene are male (c) with a testis (d and e). Scale bar = 100 μmGenotyping of the Dmrt1 allele in the F1 individuals could not be achieved because the copy number of exogenous wild-type Dmrt1 inherited in F1 was significantly higher than that of endogenous Dmrt1, and hid the original Dmrt1 allele in the genotyping assay in each F1. Genotypes of all F1 were judged as being wild type. Therefore, we established an F2 genotyping method in which we mated each of the 10 F1 XY individuals with Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XX females to obtain the next generation (F2). Since we could judge transgene inheritance using the GFP fluorescent from vasa-GFP in the F2, we could select F2 individuals lacking the transgene to genotype for the Dmrt1 allele. Based on the F2 genotypes, we could judge the parental genotypes. Since Dmrt1 C53R/C53R females were used for female parents, when we could not find Dmrt1 +/C53R F2 in the offspring, the F1 parental male was deemed Dmrt1 C53R/C53R. Nine of 10 F1 XY individuals developed male secondary sex characteristics and were identified as being fertile.The results from F2 genotyping revealed that one of the nine F1 XY individuals was homozygous mutant Dmrt1 C53R/C53R and the remaining eight were Dmrt1 +/C53R (Table 4). Furthermore, of the F2 individuals that were obtained from crossing the F1 Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY males (F1 ID = 9) with Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XX females, no XY individuals carrying the transgene developed as females and 10 of 17 developed as males (Table 5). On the other hand, all XX individuals carrying the transgene were developed as females.In this study, we identified and characterized a missense mutant of the medaka Dmrt1 gene Dmrt1 C53R. The heterozygous (Dmrt1 +/C53R) XY gonads developed into testes, whereas the homozygous (Dmrt1 C53R/C53R) XY gonads developed into ovaries. Furthermore, the Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY mutants were fertile, indicating that they underwent a complete male-to-female sex reversal. The influence of the Dmrt1 C53R mutation on the XY individuals shows that Dmrt1 is necessary for testicular development. To determine whether the sex reversal of the Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY mutants was caused by disrupted Dmrt1 function, we inserted an exogenous Dmrt1 gene into the Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY mutants. The resulting Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY “male” carrying the exogenous Dmrt1 was fertile, revealing that Dmrt1 is indispensable for testicular development in medaka. This function is the same as that of mouse Dmrt1 (Raymond et al. 2000) and chicken DMRT1 (Smith et al. 2009), suggesting the functional conservation of DMRT1 among vertebrates.Steroid hormone or high temperature treatments have induced complete sex reversals. These facts have indicated that an XY bipotential gonad can develop into not only a testis but also a complete ovary in medaka (Yamamoto 1958; Sato et al. 2005; Hattori et al. 2007). Although our XY Dmrt1 mutant finally developed into a female, in the early stage before 5 days after hatching, the germ cell number was similar to that of wild-type XY gonads, and the expression patterns of the testis-specific genes were also more similar to that of the wild-type XY gonads than the XX gonads. We found only gonial germ cells in XY mutant gonads at 5 days after hatching, whereas we found oocytes at the diplotene stage in mutant XY gonads that were similar to XX gonads at 10 days after hatching. These observations demonstrate that prior to 5 days after hatching, XY mutant gonads develop along the testis pathway. Conversely, by 10 days after hatching, the gonads of the Dmrt1 C53R/C53R XY mutants have already commenced development along the female pathway. This delayed commencement of ovarian development may cause the low number of oocytes in XY mutant gonads compared to those in XX gonads.An XY bipotential gonad develops into an ovary when fertilized XY eggs are immersed in estrogen-containing water. However, this estrogen treatment does not affect Dmy expression (Scholz et al. 2003; Suzuki et al. 2005). In these estrogen-treated XY gonads, significant increases of germ cell numbers have not been observed before hatching and at 1 and 2 days after hatching, whereas they have been confirmed at 3 days after hatching (Suzuki et al. 2005). On the other hand, Dmy dysfunction also leads XY bipotential gonads to the female pathway by blocking Dmy translation and mutations (Shinomiya et al. 2004; Otake et al. 2006; Paul-Prasanth et al. 2006). The germ cell numbers of these XY gonads are similar to those of XX gonads before hatching (Paul-Prasanth et al. 2006). Therefore, the transdifferentiation process from testis to ovary induced by Dmrt1 mutation differs from that by estrogen treatment and that by Dmy dysfunction. The timing of transdifferentiation in Dmrt1-mutant XY gonads is later than that in estrogen-treated XY gonads.At hatching, Dmy mRNA expression in heterozygous XY embryos was a little lower than those in wild-type and mutant XY embryos (Fig. 4a). However, the germ cell numbers of the heterozygous XY embryos were not affected at 5 days after hatching (Fig. 3a), suggesting that Dmy function was not affected at the mRNA level. Heterozygous Dmrt1 status may affect Dmy promoter activity.Mutant XY gonads at 30 days after hatching were comparable to complete ovaries containing many oocytes at different stages of development and expressing ovary-specific genes (Figs. 3u and 4d, e). However, the testis-specific gene Dmy was expressed at a level that was markedly higher than those of wild-type or heterozygous XY gonads, whereas expression of the testis-specific gene Dmrt1 was very low (Fig. 4c). This is not unusual because Dmy expression has been found in the follicle layer of estrogen-induced adult XY ovaries (Suzuki et al. 2005), suggesting that the Dmy acts on somatic cells surrounding germ cells regardless of testis or ovary status.Three genes are known to be expressed with sexual dimorphism in somatic cells surrounding germ cells of XY gonads in medaka. The first gene is Dmy, whose mRNA has been detected in XY gonads at stage 36 by using in situ hybridization (Kobayashi et al. 2004). Expression of the second gene, Gsdf, at stage 37 is higher in XY gonads than in XX gonads (Shibata et al. 2010). The third gene is Dmrt1. However, in situ hybridization has not been able to distinguish between Dmy and Dmrt1 because the hybridization probe for Dmy mRNA hybridizes both Dmy and Dmrt1 mRNAs due to their high similarity (93% at the nucleic acid level) (Kobayashi et al. 2004). Although these XY-specific genes are expressed in somatic cells, morphological dimorphisms of somatic cells have not been found between XX and XY gonads.Morphological sexual dimorphisms are first found in germ cells at this early developmental stage (Satoh and Egami 1972; Kobayashi et al. 2004). The sexual dimorphism in the number of germ cells results in two distinct types of germ cell proliferation in gonadal sex differentiation: type I proliferation contributes to a linear increase in the number of germ cells in XY gonads, whereas type II proliferation sustains an exponential increase in germ cells in XX gonads, which lack the Dmy gene. In XX gonads, germ cells enter meiosis following type II proliferation (Saito et al. 2007). Since Dmy dysfunction causes female-type germ cell proliferation (Paul-Prasanth et al. 2006), it is assumed that a Dmy function is to inhibit type II proliferation of germ cells until 5 days after hatching. On the other hand, germ cells in Dmrt1-mutant XY gonads, which have the Dmy gene, enter the female pathway at 10 days after hatching. Since the germ cells of normally developing XY gonads in this period are mitotically arrested, one of the presumed Dmrt1 functions is also restraining type II proliferation of these germ cells.Doublesex (dsx) and male abnormality-3 (mab-3) domainN-ethyl-N-nitrosoureaDoublesex- and mab-3-related transcription factor 1DM domain gene on the Y chromosomeHattori RS, Gould RJ, Fujioka T, Saito T, Kurita J, Strüssmann CA, Yokota M, Watanabe S (2007) Temperature-dependent sex determination in Hd-rR medaka Oryzias latipes: gender sensitivity, thermal threshold, critical period, and DMRT1 expression profile.

Progress in these areas has been hampered by the small size of most species in the family and a lack of validated techniques for assessing endocrine function. Research on a relatively small number of species has suggested that androgens are likely regulators of spermatogenesis and the development of the male brood pouch prior to pregnancy whereas prolactin and corticosteroids synergistically promote brood pouch function during pregnancy. No evidence supports a reversal of reproductive steroid hormone function in sex‐role reversed behaviour, but neuropeptides such as arginine vasotocin or isotocin should be examined for their role in regulating parturition and mating behaviour. The diversity of reproductive patterns exhibited by syngnathids suggests that they will provide a unique opportunity to assess how hormonal regulation of integumentary function, gametogenesis and reproductive behaviour have evolved within a teleost lineage. Additionally, their coastal distribution and embryo retention make them potentially important subjects for studies on the effect of endocrine disruption on fitness.Volume78, Issue6Special Issue: The Biology of Syngnathidae: Pipefishes, Seadragons and SeahorsesJune 2011Pages 1662-1680© 2011 The Authors.

Learn about our remote access optionsMale pregnancy in the family Syngnathidae (pipefishes, seahorses and seadragons) predisposes males to limit female reproductive success; sexual selection may then operate more strongly on females and female sexual signals may evolve (sex‐role reversal). A bewildering array of female signals has evolved in Syngnathids, e.g. skin folds, large body size, colouration, markings on the body and elaborate courtship. These female sexual signals do not seem quantitatively or qualitatively different from those that evolve in males in species with conventional sex roles where males provide females or offspring with direct benefits. In several syngnathid species, males also evolve ornaments, females are choosy in addition to being competitive and males compete as well as choosing partners. Thus, sex roles form a continuum, spanning from conventional to reversed within this group of fishes. Cases are presented here suggesting that stronger sexual selection on females may be most extreme in species showing classical polyandry (one male mates with several females, such as many species where males brood their eggs on the trunk), intermediate in polygynandrous species (males and females both mate with more than one partner, as in many species where males brood their eggs on the tail) and least extreme, even exhibiting conventional sex roles, in monogamous species (one male mates solely with one female, as in many seahorses and tropical pipefishes). At the same time caution is needed before unanimously establishing this pattern: first, the connection between mating patterns, strength of sexual selection, sex roles and ornament expression is far from simple and straightforward, and second, knowledge of the actual morphology, ecology and behaviour of most syngnathid species is scanty. Basically only a few Nerophis, Syngnathus and Hippocampus species have been studied in any detail. It is known, however, that this group of fishes exhibits a remarkable variation in sex roles and ornamentation, making them an ideal group for the study of mating patterns, sexual selection and sexually selected signals.Volume78, Issue6Special Issue: The Biology of Syngnathidae: Pipefishes, Seadragons and SeahorsesJune 2011Pages 1647-1661© 2011 The Authors. Journal of Fish Biology © 2011 The Fisheries Society of the British IslesWe evaluated the effects of 17(-ethinylestradiol (EE2) on sexual differentiation in transgenic olvas-GFP/STII-YI medaka (Oryzias latipes) in terms of the proliferative activity of germ cells. This strain contains the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene fused to the regulatory region of the medaka vasa gene, and germ cell-specific expression of GFP can be visualized in living (transparent) individuals. From 0 days post-hatch (0 dph) onwards, juveniles were exposed to graded concentrations of EE2 (25.2–1710 ng/L) for 35 days. The gonads of live specimens were monitored by measuring their size and calculating their GFP-fluorescence area. GFP-fluorescent area in control females was about 10 times that in control males at 10 days posthatch (dph) whereas the gonadal size of 10 dph males that had been exposed to 158 ng/L of EE2 significantly increased up to twice the size of control males, indicating that abnormal sexual differentiation towards female might occur in these individuals. Histological examination and identification of the sex-linked marker SL1 indicated that male to female sex reversal occurred at EE2 exposure ≥45.1 ng/L at 35 dph. These results suggest that observation of proliferative activity of germ cells in the olvas-GFP/STII-YI strain could be applied to facilitated screening fish model to detect adverse effects on sexual differentiation as early as 10 dph juveniles.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

523–529(2011)Cite this article147 Accesses5 Citations0 AltmetricMetricsAlthough the two medaka species Oryzias latipes and O. curvinotus share the sex-determining gene Dmy, XY sex reversal occurs in interspecific hybridization between O. latipes females of the Hd-rR inbred strain and O. curvinotus males. In this Hd-rR-curvinotus mating, all XX and XY hybrids developed as females. In this study, we used another O. latipes inbred strain (HNI) for the mating, and found that 23% of XY hybrids developed as males, although all XX and the remaining XY hybrids developed as females. Linkage analysis using 236 XY hybrid males obtained from (Hd-rR × HNI) F1 females showed that a single major locus, Hybrid maleless (Hml), on autosomal linkage group 17, contributed to the strain difference in the XY sex reversal. Furthermore, we found that crossing females of a different O. latipes inbred strain, HO4C, did not cause XY sex reversal in the interspecific hybrids, and that the XY hybrids from (Hd-rR × HO4C) F1 females showed a 1:1 sex ratio. XY hybrid males had the HO4C allele at sequence-tagged site loci around the Hml locus whereas XY females had the Hd-rR allele, confirming the strong contribution of this locus to XY sex reversal. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis showed a reduced expression of Dmycurvinotus in XY fry of the Hd-rR-curvinotus hybrids at hatching. These results suggest that the Hd-rR allele at the Hml locus interfere with the function of Dmycurvinotus on a hybrid background, thus resulting in XY sex reversal.Gonadal sex determination is a fundamental process in vertebrates because the phenotypic sex depends on whether the gonad develops into a testis or an ovary. In most mammals, a single sex-determining gene on the Y chromosome, SRY is sufficient to induce the undifferentiated gonad to develop as a testis (Gubbay et al., 1990; Sinclair et al., 1990; Koopman et al., 1991; Capel et al., 1993). SRY encodes a high mobility group domain transcription factor, and its downstream target is the Sox9 gene (Sekido and Lovell-Badge, 2008). Many other key downstream genes have been identified as having roles in the sex-differentiation pathway in human and mouse, although their molecular functions and the regulatory networks among these genes are unknown (Wilhelm et al., 2007).A second vertebrate sex-determining gene was identified in the medaka fish, Oryzias latipes. This species also has an XX/XY sex-determination system (Aida, 1921), but initiation of the male-determination pathway begins with the expression of another Y chromosome-specific gene, Dmy (Matsuda et al., 2002). Dmy is the Y-specific paralog of the autosomal Dmrt1 gene which appears to be involved in male sexual development in vertebrates (Nanda et al., 2002). Mutations with impaired Dmy function cause XY sex reversal (Shinomiya et al., 2004; Otake et al., 2006, 2008) and the presence of an exogenous Dmy gene induces XX sex reversal (Matsuda et al., 2007; Otake et al., 2009), suggesting that this gene is necessary and sufficient to induce testicular development. Dmy contains a DNA-binding motif (the DM domain), and is thus thought to encode a putative transcription factor that activates or represses downstream target genes to regulate sexual differentiation of the bipotential gonad. However, it remains unclear how Dmy controls the male-determination pathway and whether its downstream genes are conserved among vertebrates.A straightforward approach for identifying genes involved in the sex-determination pathway is the genetic analyses of sex-reversal conditions. Our previous study demonstrated an intriguing sex reversal in the interspecific hybridization between O. latipes and O. curvinotus (Shinomiya et al., 2006), despite these two species having a common sex-determining pathway with the Dmy gene on the homologous Y chromosome (Matsuda et al., 2003). In XYlatipes hybrids between O. curvinotus females and O. latipes males, Hd-rR strain males produced XY females in the hybrids (110 males and 30 females), whereas HNI males produced no XY females (70 males and 0 females). This demonstrates that there is a strain difference in the incidence of XYlatipes females (Shinomiya et al., 2006; Kato et al., 2010). A congenic approach successfully demonstrated that a small region on the Y chromosome, which included Dmy, was responsible for the strain-specific difference in this XYlatipes sex reversal (Kato et al., 2010).In the opposite cross between O. latipes females (Hd-rR strain) and O. curvinotus males, all XYcurvinotus hybrids developed as females. This suggests that Dmy derived from O. curvinotus cannot determine maleness in the hybrid background (Shinomiya et al., 2006). A previous study reported that O. latipes females from some wild strains produced both males and females in the interspecific hybrids (Sakaizumi et al., 1992), implying that there were genetic background differences in the incidence of the XYcurvinotus sex reversal. However, these strain differences have not been confirmed because there were no sex chromosome-linked markers available in the hybrid fish until recently.In the present study, we compared the ability to induce maleness in the XYcurvinotus hybrids among three medaka inbred strains, Hd-rR, HNI and HO4C, using the Dmy gene as a Y chromosomal marker. Because these strains showed different incidences of XY sex reversal in the interspecific hybrids, we mapped the chromosomal region responsible for the sex reversal. Linkage analysis using the Hd-rR and HNI strains identified a single major locus on linkage group (LG) 17, which was associated with the strain differences in the XY sex reversal. This region also contributed to differences in the frequency of hybrid sex reversal between the Hd-rR and HO4C inbred strains, suggesting that the hybrid XY sex reversal may be caused by an incompatibility between a single autosomal locus derived from O. latipes and the Dmy allele of O. curvinotus. Further analysis will reveal the molecules that interact with Dmy, and allow us to understand the molecular mechanisms of sex determination that begin with Dmy.We used a laboratory stock of O. curvinotus, as well as three inbred strains (HNI, Hd-rR and HO4C) of O. latipes. All fish were supplied by a sub-center (Niigata University, Japan) of the National Bioresource Project (Medaka) (http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/medaka/). The wild stock of O. curvinotus was originally collected in Hong Kong in 1986 (see Takehana et al., 2005). HNI was established from the Northern Japanese Population, whereas Hd-rR and HO4C were from the Southern Japanese Population (Hyodo-Taguchi, 1996; Kinoshita et al., 2009). The fish were maintained in aquaria under an artificial 14-h light/10-h dark photoperiod at 27±2 °C.Hybrid fish were obtained from matings between O. latipes females and O. curvinotus males (XY or YY males) by pair mating. Naturally spawned eggs were collected and incubated under the same conditions as the adult fish. Hatched hybrid fish were reared until maturation for 2–3 months, and examined for their phenotypic and genotypic sexes.Phenotypic sex was judged based on secondary sex characteristics, namely, the shapes of the dorsal and anal fins. Genotypic sex (XY or XX) was determined by the presence or absence of the Dmy gene of O. curvinotus evaluated by PCR amplification of caudal fin clip genomic DNA extracted from adult fish. PCR amplification was performed with the primers PG17.eS (5′-CGCCTTGAGGAGGCAGCAGG-3′) and PG17.20U (5′-GCATCTGCTGGTACTGCTGGTAGTTG-3′) with an annealing temperature of 65 °C (Shinomiya et al., 2006). Because the PCR primers amplify both Dmy and its autosomal paralog Dmrt1, individuals with only Dmrt1 fragments were judged to have an XX genotype, and those with both Dmy and Dmrt1 fragments were judged to have an XY genotype.Fertilized eggs of O. curvinotus were incubated in water containing estradiol-17β (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) at 0.2 μg ml−1 until hatching. Hatched fry were transferred to normal tap water and fed on a commercial pet-food diet until sexual maturation. Sex-reversed XY females were identified by PCR genotyping of Dmy and subsequently mated with normal XY males. YY males were selected by PCR genotyping of Dmy and Casp6 (Kondo et al., 2001; Matsuda et al., 2003).Sixty expressed sequence tag (EST) markers covering twenty-four chromosomes were used to map the locus responsible for strain-specific differences in hybrid sex reversal. The primer sequences used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1, and the mapped positions of the EST markers are available in M Base (http://earth.lab.nig.ac.jp/~mbase/medaka_top.html). In addition, we designed sequence-tagged site (STS) primers based on genome sequence data (UTGB medaka genome browser: http://medaka.utgenome.org/ or Ensembl genome browser: http://www.ensembl.org), and used these STS markers for fine mapping. Primer sequences and chromosomal locations of these markers are listed in Supplementary Table S2. Individual PCR conditions were optimized for each primer pair, and products were digested with restriction enzymes if necessary. Separation of PCR products was performed by conventional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Kimura et al., 2004).Total RNA was extracted from fry at 8 days post fertilization (dpf) using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan), and subjected to reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) using a OneStep RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen). Aliquots (20 ng) of the total RNA were used as templates in 25 μl reaction volumes. The PCR amplification conditions were as follows: 30 min at 55 °C; 15 min at 95 °C; cycles of 30 s at 96 °C, 30 s at the annealing temperature and 60 s at 72 °C; and 5 min at 72 °C. The number of PCR cycles for Dmy and β-actin was adjusted to be 36 cycles and 22 cycles, and the annealing temperature at 63 °C and 55 °C, respectively. The primers for Dmy (cY331, 5′-AGG CTT CGT CCG GCC CTG AA-3′ and cY4-5U, 5′-GAG GCT CCT GGT GCA GAA CG-3′) amplified a 449-bp DNA fragment. The primers for β-actin (3b, 5′-CMG TCA GGA TCT TCA TSA GG-3′ and 4, 5′-CAC ACC TTC TAC AAT GAG CTG A-3′) amplified a 322-bp DNA fragment (Otake et al., 2006). Aliquots of 8 and 2 μl of the Dmy and β-actin RT–PCR products, respectively, were electrophoresed in a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide.Our previous study indicated that interspecific hybridization between O. latipes females and O. curvinotus males caused complete XY sex reversal (Shinomiya et al., 2006). We used Hd-rR inbred strain females for matings with O. curvinotus males (Hd-rR-curvinotus), and found that all 569 hybrids developed as females. Among 99 genotyped individuals, 55 individuals had the XX genotype and 44 had XY, demonstrating that all XY individuals were sex reversed (Table 1). In the present study, we used another inbred strain, HNI, for matings with O. curvinotus males (HNI-curvinotus). All 69 XX hybrids were female, whereas the 60 XY hybrids consisted of 46 females and 14 males (23%), indicating that the HNI strain could produce XY males in the hybrids. This means that the two inbred strains HNI and Hd-rR differ in their incidences of XY sex reversal in the interspecific hybrids. Next, we used (Hd-rR × HNI) F1 females and (F1 × Hd-rR) BC1 females for matings with O. curvinotus males. The F1 females produced 147 females and 38 males (21%) in the XY hybrids, and four out of five BC1 females produced males in the XY hybrids wheras the one remaining female did not (Table 1).To map the chromosomal region(s) responsible for the strain differences in the XY sex reversal ratio, an initial linkage analysis was performed using EST markers established in O. latipes. In the cross between (Hd-rR × HNI) F1 females and O. curvinotus males, the hybrids have either an Hd-rR- or an HNI-derived allele at each locus (Figure 1). Because XY males were found only in the HNI-curvinotus hybrids, we assumed that the chromosomal regions heterozygous for HNI and O. curvinotus were responsible for producing XY males. Among 38 hybrid males obtained from the cross, we selected 24 males and used them for genome-wide genotyping with 60 EST markers covering 24 chromosomes. Then we searched for loci that showed a significant deviation from the expected 1:1 ratio, using a classical chi-squared test. The tests revealed significantly high chi-squared values at four loci, OLa21.11f, OLc30.09h, AU168385 and MF01SSA074C05 (P<0.01), which are all located on LG 17 (Table 2). At these loci, HNI/curvinotus heterozygotes appeared at a significantly higher frequency than the 1:1 ratio, but other loci did not show a significant deviation from the expected 1:1 segregation. Furthermore, genotyping for the BC1 females used in progeny tests (see Table 1) revealed that BC1 females producing XY males had the HNI/Hd-rR genotype whereas those producing only XY females had the Hd-rR/Hd-rR genotype at the EST markers on LG 17 (data not shown). These results suggested that a single major locus, which we named Hybrid maleless (Hml), was associated with the strain differences in the hybrid sex reversal ratio.Mating scheme for linkage analysis. F1 females between Hd-rR and HNI strains were crossed with O. curvinotus males, and the resulting XY males in the hybrids were used for genetic mapping. These XY males had an O. curvinotus-derived Y chromosome and various combinations of HNI chromosomal segments in the autosomes and the X chromosome. We searched for chromosomal regions heterozygous for HNI and O. curvinotus alleles, which could produce XY males. Solid, HNI-derived chromosome; open, Hd-rR-derived chromosome; dotted, O. curvinotus-derived chromosome. The position of the sex-determining gene Dmy is shown.Genetic mapping using all 38 XY hybrid males showed that the Hml locus was located on LG 17 flanked by the two molecular markers AU171199 and LG17-29 (Figure 2a). To map the Hml locus precisely, we obtained an additional 198 XY hybrid males from matings between (Hd-rR × HNI) F1 females and O. curvinotus YY males, and genotyped new STS markers. This analysis narrowed the chromosomal location of Hml to a 1.2 cM interval between the two markers gs20859 and LG17–29, with strong linkage to an additional four markers LG17–54, sca3316, LG17–49 and LG17–51 (0 recombination events in 236 meioses; Figure 2b). On the basis of the latest genome assembly (version 1.0), three scaffolds (354, 435 and 1423) were mapped to this region, although there remain large gaps (approximately 120 and 140 kb) between the scaffolds (Figure 2c). To find candidate genes in this region, we surveyed mapped genes on these scaffolds using the UCSC genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu). Among 12 genes found in this region (chr17: 10.8–11.6 Mb), seven encoded zinc finger proteins, suggesting a clustered organization of these genes on the Hml region.Genetic and physical map around the Hml locus. (a) A sparse genetic map around the Hml locus on linkage group 17. (b) A high-resolution recombination map around the Hml locus. The Hml gene was mapped to a 1.2 cM interval based on the genotyping of 236 XY hybrid males. The numbers under each map indicate the number of recombinants between Hml and the adjacent marker. (c) A physical map around the Hml locus based on the available genome sequence data (version 1.0; http://medaka.utgenome.org/). Three scaffolds (354, 435 and 1423) are mapped to this region but there remain gaps between the scaffolds.For further fine mapping, we used another inbred strain, HO4C, for matings with YY males of O. curvinotus (HO4C-curvinotus). In this cross, all 34 XY hybrids developed as males with no sex reversal (Table 3), demonstrating that Dmycurvinotus sufficiently induced maleness on this hybrid background. Then, we used (Hd-rR × HO4C) F1 females for the matings, and found a 1:1 Mendelian ratio of males to females in the XY hybrids (135 and 121 progeny, respectively) (Table 3). Furthermore, two STS markers, gs20859 and LG17-10, showed strong linkage to the phenotypic sex (Table 4). For these loci, XY females had the Hd-rR/curvinotus genotype whereas XY males had the HO4C/curvinotus genotype. These results strongly suggest that the Hml locus is involved in the different sex reversal ratios between Hd-rR-curvinotus and HO4C-curvinotus hybrids.Reduced expression levels of the sex-determining gene Dmy have been observed in some XY sex-reversal mutants of O. latipes (Matsuda et al., 2002; Otake et al., 2006). To examine the relationship between the hybrid sex reversal and the Dmycurvinotus expression level, we performed an RT-PCR analysis of fry at hatching (8 dpf) in the Hd-rR-curvinotus hybrids, the HO4C-curvinotus hybrids and the male parental strain of O. curvinotus (Figure 3). The Dmy mRNA level was slightly lower in XY fry of the HO4C-curvinotus hybrids than in that of O. curvinotus, although all the XY hybrids developed as males in adulthood. On the other hand, Dmy expression was not detected in XY fry of the Hd-rR-curvinotus hybrids, which developed as all females in adulthood, suggesting that reduced expression of Dmycurvinotus was associated with the XY sex reversal in the Hd-rR-curvinotus hybrids.Expression of Dmy in the medaka hybrids. Dmycurvinotus mRNA expression in fry at hatching (8 dpf) was analysed by RT-PCR. β-actin expression was determined for calibration. Depressed or eliminated expression of Dmy transcripts was observed in XY fry of the Hd-rR-curvinotus hybrids.Our mating experiments clearly demonstrated that the incidence of XY females was different among inbred strains of O. latipes. All XY individuals (44/44) in Hd-rR-curvinotus hybrids were sex-reversed females, whereas 23% (14/60) of XY HNI-curvinotus hybrids developed as males. Furthermore, all XY (34/34) HO4C-curvinotus hybrids developed as males, indicating that there are strain differences in the ability to induce maleness in the XY hybrids. Among these hybrids, the Y chromosome and one set of autosomes are derived from O. curvinotus whereas another set of autosomes and the X chromosome are different, suggesting that the presence or absence of XY females in the hybrids can be attributed to the differences in the maternal genome. Notably, male fish appeared only in XY individuals, indicating that Dmycurvinotus is necessary for the male determination of the hybrids. Taken together, these findings suggest that the XY sex reversal in the hybrids results from incompatibility between the Dmycurvinotus allele and the O. latipes alleles of autosomal and/or X chromosomal loci.The sex reversal condition observed in the medaka hybrids is similar to XY sex reversal in B6-YPOS mice. This situation occurs when the Y chromosome derived from Mus poschiavinus (YPOS) is transferred onto the C57BL/6J (B6) inbred strain that normally carries a M. musculus Y chromosome (Eicher et al., 1982). Genetic background differences have been characterized in the inbred mouse strains. The B6 background was particularly sensitive to XY sex reversal, whereas other strains, including DBA/2J and 129S1/SvImJ, were found to be completely resistant to YPOS-associated sex reversal (Nikolova et al., 2008). Quantitative trait loci mapping using the B6-YPOS and DBA/2J strains identified multiple loci that conferred some but not all of the observed sensitivity to XY sex reversal in B6 (Eicher et al., 1996). More recently, a congenic approach using the B6.129S1/SvImJ-YPOS strain identified that a chromosome 11 region derived from the 129S1/SvImJ strain provided partial protection from sex reversal in XYPOS mice (Nikolova et al., 2008). These findings implicate the combined effects of many loci (rather than a single gene) in conferring the sensitivity to sex reversal in B6-YPOS; this has been confirmed by a recent expression quantitative trait loci approach (Munger et al., 2009).By contrast, a single locus is implicated in sex reversal in the medaka hybrids. (Hd-rR × HNI) F1 females produced XY males in the interspecific hybrids, and four out of five (F1 × Hd-rR) BC1 females produced XY males, whereas the remaining BC1 female did not, implying that a small number of genes contributed to the strain differences in the hybrid XY sex reversal. Our linkage analysis using XY hybrid males obtained from (Hd-rR × HNI) F1 females successfully identified the single major locus Hml on LG 17 that confers sensitivity to the XY sex reversal in the hybrids. In addition, genotyping for XY hybrids obtained from (Hd-rR × HO4C) F1 females revealed strong linkage to STS markers around the Hml locus, suggesting that the same Hml locus contributed to the sex reversal in the different XY hybrids. These results suggest that a single gene, rather than a disrupted global network, causes XY sex reversal in the medaka hybrids. Thus, it is likely that allelic differences at the single Hml locus affect Dmycurvinotus function in the male-determining process in the hybrid fish.Dmy transcripts first appear just before hatching exclusively in XY individuals of O. latipes and O. curvinotus (Matsuda et al., 2003; Kobayashi et al., 2004; Shinomiya et al., 2006). Reduced expression of the Dmy gene causes male-to-female sex reversal in O. latipes, suggesting that a threshold level of Dmy expression is required for male development (Matsuda et al., 2002; Otake et al., 2006, 2008). Our RT-PCR analysis of the medaka hybrids also revealed that Dmy expression levels in XY fry differed between Hd-rR-curvinotus and HO4C-curvinotus hybrids, in agreement with their sex reversal ratio. Hd-rR-curvinotus hybrids showed a loss of Dmycurvinotus expression in the XY fry, which developed as all phenotypic females, suggesting that the Hml gene is an upstream regulator of Dmy. Thus, the XY sex reversal in the hybrids may result from an incompatibility between the cis-regulatory region of the Dmycurvinotus allele and some Hml alleles of O. latipes as a trans-acting factor.In this study, only 23% of XY individuals developed as males in the HNI-curvinotus hybrids. XY hybrids harboring identical genotypes developed as males or females, suggesting an incomplete penetrance for this phenotype. In the medaka mutants, a low level of Dmy expression below a threshold can induce sex reversal in a subset of XY individuals having the same chromosomal condition (Otake et al., 2006). Thus, a certain threshold level of Dmy expression may be required for male determination also in the hybrid backgrounds. Similar to the HNI-curvinotus hybrids, we obtained male XY hybrids from (Hd-rR × HNI) F1 females. However, the incidence of XY males (21%) was higher than expected. In this cross, we estimated that approximately 11% of XY individuals would become males, because half of the XY hybrids would have the Hd-rR allele at the Hml locus, and develop as females, whereas the other half of the XY hybrids would have the HNI allele, and consist of males (23%) and females (77%). The observed high incidence of XY hybrid males is probably due to a background effect when the HNI allele at the Hml locus is in the hybrid background containing a part of the Hd-rR genome. Therefore, the Hd-rR background in the hybrids seems to affect the Dmy expression level itself or the threshold for Dmy expression, and thus cause the higher frequency of the XY males. However, further expression analysis of Dmy is necessary to test these hypotheses.In both O. latipes and O. curvinotus, the first appearance of morphological sex differentiation was a difference in the number of germ cells between XX and XY embryos, and a subset of germ cells in XX entered meiosis around hatching (Shinomiya et al., 2006). Later, morphological sex differences in somatic cells were observed. When Dmy function is impaired, germ cells in XY embryos start to proliferate and then enter meiosis just like XX embryos (Otake et al., 2006, 2008). These findings suggest that Dmy is involved in the regulation of germ cell proliferation at the early sex-determining stage and the formation of the testicular architecture. Previous histological observation of developing gonads in Hd-rR–curvinotus hybrids demonstrated that active proliferation of germ cells and oogenesis occurred in early gonadal development in the XY hybrids, identical to the early ovarian development in the XX hybrids (Shinomiya et al., 2006). Therefore, it is likely that the mismatching of the Hd-rR allele at the Hml locus with the regulatory region of Dmycurvinotus in the hybrids causes reduced expression of Dmy and disruption of the initial testis-determination steps including suppression of germ cell proliferation, thus resulting in XY sex reversal.Detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the sex reversal in the XY hybrids requires isolation and molecular characterization of the Hml locus. Although we found 12 candidate genes including 7 zinc finger proteins within the Hml region, other genes should be potentially located on the gap regions. To find them, we performed genomic synteny analysis using the Genomicus genome browser (version 60.01; http://www.dyogen.ens.fr/genomicus/). However, we could not find other candidate genes by this approach, because the genes around the Hml region were mapped to several chromosomes and/or scaffolds in other fish species including stickleback and Tetraodon. Furthermore, the gene order was not conserved among these fish species. Therefore, we have taken a positional approach to isolate the Hml gene, and started a chromosome walking using a bacterial artificial chromosome clones. So far, we have isolated two bacterial artificial chromosome clones that fill the gaps, and estimated the 1.2 cM region of interest to be 670–720 kb (with the gap region as 200–250 kb in total) which is similar to that in the genome data. To identify the Hml gene, we will determine the complete genomic sequence of these bacterial artificial chromosome clones, identify the functional genes in this genomic region and perform functional analyses of the candidate genes. Isolation of the Hml gene will help to define not only the processes and mechanisms underlying the hybrid XY sex reversal but also the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of Dmy in normal development of O. latipes and O. curvinotus.Aida T (1921).

 11, Article number: 121 (2011) Cite this article5688 Accesses11 Citations4 AltmetricMetricsBoth natural and sexual selection are thought to influence genetic diversity, but the study of the relative importance of these two factors on ecologically-relevant traits has traditionally focused on species with conventional sex-roles, with male-male competition and female-based mate choice. With its high variability and significance in both immune function and olfactory-mediated mate choice, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC/MH) is an ideal system in which to evaluate the relative contributions of these two selective forces to genetic diversity. Intrasexual competition and mate choice are both reversed in sex-role reversed species, and sex-related differences in the detection and use of MH-odor cues are expected to influence the intensity of sexual selection in such species. The seahorse, Hippocampus abdominalis, has an exceptionally highly developed form of male parental care, with female-female competition and male mate choice.Here, we demonstrate that the sex-role reversed seahorse has a single MH class II beta-chain gene and that the diversity of the seahorse MHIIβ locus and its pattern of variation are comparable to those detected in species with conventional sex roles. Despite the presence of only a single gene copy, intralocus MHIIβ allelic diversity in this species exceeds that observed in species with multiple copies of this locus. The MHIIβ locus of the seahorse exhibits a novel expression domain in the male brood pouch.The high variation found at the seahorse MHIIβ gene indicates that sex-role reversed species are capable of maintaining the high MHC diversity typical in most vertebrates.Whether such species have evolved the capacity to use MH-odor cues during mate choice is presently being investigated using mate choice experiments. If this possibility can be rejected, such systems would offer an exceptional opportunity to study the effects of natural selection in isolation, providing powerful comparative models for understanding the relative importance of selective factors in shaping patterns of genetic variation.The impact of natural and sexual selection on genetic diversity has been intensively studied in both natural and captive-bred populations [1], but the majority of our current knowledge in this area is derived from species with conventional sex roles, with choosy females and competitive males [2, 3]. Sex-role reversed species, in which females compete for mating opportunities and males are choosy [4, 5], offer exceptional opportunities to investigate central tenets of sexual selection theory and the importance of sexual selection in the maintenance of genetic diversity.The hypervariable major histocompatibility complex (MHC/MH) has proven to be a powerful model in which to investigate the importance of natural and sexual selection in shaping genetic diversity [6–8]. The MHC is an essential part of the vertebrate adaptive immune system, and includes a suite of more than 200 genes involved in the destruction of infected cells and the antibody response [9]. There are two major antigen-presenting groups of MHC molecules, class I and class II genes, which differ in their function, structure and pattern of expression [9]. The peptide binding region (PBR) of MHC loci encodes a groove that permits the binding of specific antigens, and this region typically exhibits the highest sequence polymorphism within the gene [10].The investigation of MHC genes in a diversity of vertebrates indicates that these loci are more diverse than any other gene family [9]. Natural selection on MHC is thought to be driven primarily by pathogens, leading to balancing selection that acts on the PBR of MHC genes [11]. Balancing selection operates through either negative frequency-dependent selection, in which the relative fitness of individual alleles is influenced by their frequency (reviewed in [6]), or via heterozygote advantage. The advantage of MHC heterozygosity lies in the potential increase of the number of different parasite-derived antigens that can be detected by a MHC-heterozygous individual's immune system [12]. MHC diversity can be further enhanced by selection on linked genes, due to genetic hitchhiking [13, 14]. In addition to the importance of MHC genes as an integral part of the adaptive immune system, MHC-mediated odor cues have been shown to be important in mate choice, kin recognition and inbreeding avoidance [15–19]. Disassortative mating is widely believed to promote MHC diversity and to increase the proportion of heterozygote individuals in natural populations [15, 20, 21]. Sexual selection can thus directly contribute to MHC allelic diversity via disassortative mate choice [12].Despite consistently high levels of variation, there are major differences in the genomic organization of MHC genes in different vertebrate groups. While these loci are physically linked in mammals, class I and II genes are unlinked in bony fishes (class Actinopterygii) [22, 23]. Due to the lack of linkage of MHC genes in actinopterygians, Stet et al. [23] have suggested that major histocompatibility genes in these species are most accurately termed MH loci. The unlinked nature of MH genes may provide increased evolutionary flexibility and contribute to enhanced MH diversity in this group. MH gene diversity is highly variable in teleost fishes, and while some species have a single classical MH class II beta-chain gene (MHIIβ) (e.g. salmonids [24, 25]), most species have multiple copies of this locus (e.g. sticklebacks: 4-6 copies [26], perch: >8 copies [27], cichlids: >10 copies [28]). This variation may be due, at least in part, to ancestral chromosome or genome duplications [29].While previous studies on teleosts have shown that both natural and sexual selection structure MH allelic diversity in species with conventional female-based mate choice [16, 30, 31], no study to date has investigated MH variation in sex-role reversed species in which mating decisions are made by the male. Males and females often differ in their ability to detect odor cues [32, 33], and sex differences in the production, processing and use of MH-mediated signals are expected to influence the relative efficiency of sexual selection in sex-role reversed and conventionally-mating species, potentially reducing the level of MH variation in species with reversed sex-roles.The teleost family Syngnathidae (seahorses and pipefish) is a well-suited model system to study questions concerning the relationship between sex roles and MH diversity. Both conventional and sex-role reversed species exist in the family and sex-role reversal has evolved several times independently in this group [34]. Studies of wild populations of the potbellied seahorse, Hippocampus abdominalis, have found evidence of female-female competition and male mate choice, suggesting that natural populations of this species are sex-role reversed [35].Here, we characterize MH-variation in wild-caught and captive-bred individuals of sex-role reversed populations of the potbellied seahorse, a species with a highly developed form of male parental care. Genome sequencing and transcriptome screening confirm the existence of a single, highly variable copy of the MHIIβ locus in this species, with a pattern of variation identical to that detected in species with conventional sex roles. This pattern of genetic variation has been influenced by a combination of intralocus recombination and positive selection on sites believed to be important for peptide binding. MHIIβ is expressed in brood pouch tissues of male seahorses, suggesting that these molecules may be functionally active during male pregnancy. Our results indicate that sex-role reversed taxa such as the seahorse are capable of maintaining the high MHC diversity typical of vertebrate species with conventional sex roles.Full-length gDNA sequencing of the seahorse MHIIβ locus from a single non-pregnant male identified 2 alleles, closely related to other teleost MHIIβ sequences (Blastn: Hippocampus kuda: e-value = 0.0, Hippocampus sp.: e-value = 2e-100, Monopterus albus: e-value = 2e-35, Archoplites interruptus: e-value = 1e-33, Tetraodon nigroviridis: e-value = 1e-33). The structure of MHIIβ in the seahorse is similar to that in other vertebrates, with 6 exons separated by 5 introns of varying length (Figure 1). The total intron length of the 2 full-length alleles differs, resulting in full gene sequences of 3508 bp and 3523 bp, respectively. Intron length variability is concentrated in 3 single-bp repetitive regions (An, Cn and Tn) located in introns 2 and 4 (Figure 1).Seahorse MHIIβ gene map. The locations of exons, repetitive regions (An, Cn and Tn) and primers used for genome walking and sequencing (see table 3) are indicated. The peptide binding region (PBR) of MHIIβ is located in exon 2. The full gene sequence has been submitted to GenBank (Accession #: HQ902181 and HQ902182).Complete MHIIβ exon 2 sequences were obtained for 96 captive-bred and 5 wild-caught individuals. Irrespective of the primer combination used, a maximum of two alleles were found in all 101 individuals, indicating the existence of a single MHIIβ locus in this species. The comparison of parent-offspring MH profiles in 5 families of seahorses confirmed the Mendelian inheritance of the seahorse MHIIβ locus (Table 1). A 454-cDNA-library of the potbellied seahorse yielded 36 MHIIβ sequences (23 from pregnant pouch tissue (normalized/unnormalized: 18/5), 5 from non-pregnant pouch tissue (2/3), and 8 from normalized reference tissues) which could be assembled into a single contig identical to the MHIIβ genomic DNA sequence. cDNA sequencing indicated that the MHIIβ gene of the seahorse is expressed in muscle, liver and brood pouch tissue.Sequencing of the highly-variable peptide binding region of the seahorse MHIIβ locus identified a total of 17 H. abdominalis MHII β1-domain alleles in 101 individuals (Figure 2). 86% of individuals were heterozygous for MHIIβ (87 of 101), while 14% were homozygous, consistent with Hardy-Weinberg expectations (HWE Exact Test: p = 0.08). An analysis of allelic assortment detected 4 allele combinations more frequently than expected by chance (Figure 3; Hiab-DAB-E2*03/*03 p = 0.020, *04/*05 p = 0.040, *05/*13 p = 0.029, *07/*08 p = 0.001), but none of these values remained significant after correcting for multiple comparisons (Sequential Bonferroni correction). The 17 alleles include 25 polymorphic nucleotide sites and a total of 17 amino acid differences (Figure 4). Each of the 17 alleles differs by at least one amino acid substitution (Figure 4, 5). All alleles detected in wild individuals (Hiab-DAB-E2*01, 04, 05, 09, 13, 16 and 17) were also detected in the captive-bred population. The nucleotide diversity π of the seahorse MHII β1-domain is 0.034. The dataset used for subsequent analyses contains 270 bp of exon 2 (total length: 273 bp), after omitting exon-spanning codons at the 5' and 3' ends of the exon (2 bp and 1 bp, respectively).Nucleotide alignment of exon 2. 17 MHIIβ exon 2 sequences were obtained in 101 H. abdominalis specimens.

Figure 5b: Recombinant alleles (RECCO: p < 0.05) have been removed (DAB-E2*06, DAB-E2*10 and DAB-E2*16).Only 2 of the 25 nucleotide substitutions detected in exon 2 of the seahorse are synonymous, leading to a dN/dS ratio of 3.7 (dN = 0.041, dS = 0.011, Table 2). A strong signal of positive selection was detected in this region (Z-Test p = 0.02), and 11 of the 17 variable amino acid sites are inferred to be under positive selection (p < 0.05, Figure 4) (seahorse sites 4, 6, 8, 17, 43, 60, 63, 67, 70, 74 and 81). A model incorporating positive selection fits the exon 2 dataset significantly better than a neutral model of evolution (M8 vs. M7, LRT = 46.744, df = 2, p < 0.01). Non-peptide binding sites in exon 2 show considerably less non-synonymous variation than do PBS (non-PBS dN = 0.018, PBS dN = 0.128) and exhibit no evidence of positive selection (dN/dS = 1.5; Z-Test p = 0.34; Table 2).An allele network based on non-synonymous substitutions was reconstructed to visualize relationships among the 17 unique MHIIβ alleles. The network shows no clear spatial structure, consistent with the pattern expected for a single locus (Figure 5a). The reticulative loop in the network suggests the presence of recombinant variants in the dataset, a hypothesis supported by statistical analyses (RECCO, p < 0.01), which indicate that 3 MHIIβ alleles are the result of intralocus recombination (Hiab-DAB-E2*06: p = 0.01, Hiab-DAB-E2*10: p = 0.01 and Hiab-DAB-E2*16: p = 0.03). A network without these recombinant alleles is qualitatively similar to the full network, but the placement of Hiab-DAB-E2*09 shifts in the pruned dataset, reflecting its high level of divergence from the central haplotypes (Figure 5b).The sex-role reversed potbellied seahorse, H. abdominalis, has a single MHIIβ gene, which exhibits the typical vertebrate pattern of high genetic diversity. The existence of a maximum of 2 MHIIβ alleles per individual and the analysis of parent-offspring genotypes in 5 families of seahorses supports the Mendelian segregation of a single locus in this species. The high variability of the β1-domain of this gene, the region interacting with antigens, has been generated and maintained by a combination of positive selection and intralocus recombination, factors which have been shown to influence the pattern of MH variation in species with conventional sex roles [7, 26]. The results of targeted gene sequencing are congruent with a transcriptome screen which indicates that a single copy of this locus is expressed in muscle, liver and brood pouch tissue of the seahorse. The expression of MHIIβ in pouch tissue of H. abdominalis males suggests that MH molecules may be immunologically active in brood-pouch tissues, and could possibly play a role in immune protection during the development of embryos in the paternal brood pouch [36].Previous studies of MHIIβ diversity in teleost fishes have demonstrated the exceptionally high diversity of this locus in this group (reviewed in [7]). These studies have, however, focused on species with conventional sex roles, with female-based mate choice and male-male competition (e.g. Gasterosteus aculeatus [37], Oncorhynchus spp., Perca fluviatilis [38] and Poecilia reticulata [39]). As males and females often differ in their ability to detect olfactory cues [32, 33], the efficiency of odor-based MHC-mediated choice as a selective mechanism might be expected to differ between sex-role reversed and conventionally-mating species. Disassortative mating is thought to act together with pathogen-mediated selection to maintain MHC diversity [15, 20], and species which lack the ability to detect and process MHC-based odor cues are thus expected to exhibit reduced levels of MHC diversity relative to species experiencing both forms of selection. Contrary to this hypothesis, MHIIβ diversity in the sex-role reversed seahorse is similar to that detected in other teleosts (see below), suggesting that sex-role reversed species are capable of maintaining the high MH diversity typical in other vertebrates. Both natural and sexual selection are thought to influence MH diversity [8], but the observation of high MHIIβ diversity in a sex-role reversed species suggests that natural selection may be sufficient to generate this high variability, a hypothesis which is currently being investigated using individual-based simulations (Ejsmond MJ, Radwan J and Wilson AB, in prep.). Alternatively, sex-role reversed species may indeed be capable of processing MH-based olfactory cues, something which is currently under investigation in targeted mate choice experiments in the seahorse.MHIIβ gene-copy variation is high in teleosts, and while some teleost fishes have more than 10 functional copies of MHIIβ, a small number of species have only a single locus. Perhaps the best studied example of this are the ancestral tetraploid salmonids, who possess a single classical MHIIβ gene [25]. The high MHII β1-domain diversity of the potbellied seahorse is similar to that found in this group. The seahorse carries a similar number of alleles (H. abdominalis: 17 alleles in 101 individuals, Oncorhynchus gilae gilae: 5/142, O. tshawytscha: 12/144, Salmo trutta: 24/180, O. mykiss: 88/423), but exhibits fewer polymorphic sites (25 variable sites, 6.2% polymorphism) than that found in salmonids (21 - 70 variable sites, 7.7 - 27.2% polymorphism) [40–43]. H. abdominalis and salmonids show comparable nucleotide diversities in the PBR-containing β1-domain of exon 2 (H. abdominalis: π = 0.034; O. gilae gilae: π = 0.040 [43]; S. trutta: π = 0.054 [41]).As interlocus gene conversion is thought to contribute to the diversity of gene families [44], one might expect to see higher intralocus variability in species carrying multiple MHIIβ loci. While species carrying several functional copies of MHIIβ possess a higher total number of alleles, intralocus measures of MHIIβ PBR diversity in these species are in fact less than those observed in species with only a single locus. Three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), an important model system for the study of teleost MH evolution, are thought to carry at least 4 copies of MHIIβ [16, 26, 45]. A recent survey of 48 sticklebacks from locations in Europe and North America detected a total of 31 exon 2 alleles, or ≤ 8 alleles per locus [26]. Similarly, a survey of Trinidadian guppies, Poecilia reticulata, a species with at least 2 MHIIβ loci, recovered 18 exon 2 alleles in 56 individuals (alleles per locus ≤ 9) [21]. This pattern can also be observed in other species, for example in Poecilia formosa [46] and Perca fluviatilis [27], with 9 alleles in 29 individuals (≥ 2 MHIIβ loci; ≤ 5 alleles per locus) and 28 alleles in 58 individuals (≥ 8 MHIIβ loci; ≤ 4 alleles per locus), respectively. Methodological differences in the sample sizes and spatial scales of studies of MH variation complicate comparative analyses of genetic diversity, but the fact that species carrying a single MHIIβ locus have levels of allelic variation equal or greater than those detected in species with multiple copies of these loci (see above), suggests that intralocus allelic diversity of the MHIIβ PBR does not necessarily increase when more genes are present in a species. It is important to note, that maximal MHC diversity may also be constrained, both by interactions with the autoimmune response [47, 48] and by consistently high levels of interlocus gene conversion, which may tend to homogenize genetic variation in species carrying multiple copies of these genes [49]. These factors may, in part, explain the lower than expected levels of MH variation detected in such species relative to species carrying a single copy of these genes.We detected an excess of non-synonymous substitutions relative to synonymous substitutions in the PBR-encoding β1-domain of the seahorse, a pattern consistent with that found in species with conventional female-based mate choice. Due to the lack of X-ray crystallographic structure analyses of teleost MH genes, PBS in fishes are typically inferred by homology modeling to human MHC loci [50]. In addition, sites exhibiting a high variability and signatures of positive selection are also putative candidates for peptide binding sites [8, 51, 52]. 17 of the 90 MHII β1-domain sites of the seahorse are variable (19%), and 11 of these variable sites (65%) show evidence of positive selection. 9 of 11 sites correspond to human PBS as inferred by Reche and Reinherz [50] (Figure 4). While the length of the MHII β1-domain sequenced often differs between studies, several recent studies have analysed site-specific variation in the same 56 amino acid fragment of MHII β1, stretching from position 25 to 80 of the human alignment (Figure 4). A comparison among these studies indicates that the proportion of sites under positive selection in this region is similar between the sex-role reversed seahorse (6/56 = 11%), and conventionally mating salmonids (5-21%, [40]), Poecilia spp. (11-15%, [46]) and perch (22%, [27]), illustrating the striking consistency in the pattern of MH variation among species, despite differences in their sex roles.We provide the first data on the pattern of MH diversity in the seahorse (H. abdominalis), a species with an exceptionally well-developed form of paternal care and male mate choice. The sex-role reversed H. abdominalis exhibits levels of MHIIβ diversity similar to that detected in species with conventional sex roles. This species has a single functional MH class II beta-chain gene that is expressed in the male brood pouch, suggesting that this gene may be immunologically active in these tissues. The pattern of MHIIβ genetic diversity in the seahorse has been influenced by positive selection and recombination, and intralocus genetic diversity in this species exceeds that present in species carrying multiple copies of this gene. Mating experiments are currently being used to determine whether MH-odor cues are used in mate choice decisions in H. abdominalis, data which should help to shed light on the relative roles of natural and sexual selection in generating the high levels of MHIIβ diversity found in the seahorse.Whole genomic DNA was extracted from muscle tissue of a single H. abdominalis individual using a standard proteinase K/phenol-chloroform protocol [53]. To characterize MHIIβ genes in the seahorse, we first designed primers in conserved regions of the gene. These regions were identified using an alignment of published sequences for 11 teleost species (Danio rerio - Dare [GenBank:AAA50043], Salmo salar - Sasa [GenBank:AJ439067], Cyprinus carpio - Cyca [GenBank:CAD89312, CAA64709], Tetraodon nigroviridis - Teni [GenBank:CAF94187], Oryzias latipes - Orla [GenBank:BAA94279, BAA94280], Poecilia reticulata - Pore [GenBank:Z54077], Stizostedion vitreum - Stvi [GenBank:AY158837], Paralichthys olivaceus - Paol [GenBank:AB126922, AB126923, AY848955], Gasterosteus aculeatus - Gaac [GenBank:AY713945], Hippocampus kuda - Hiku [GenBank:AY211533], Takifugu rubripes - Taru [Ensembl:ENSTRUP00000004737], Oryzias latipes - Orla [Ensembl:ENSORLG00000000025]). Sequences were aligned in BioEdit v.7.0.9.1 [54] and primers were designed using Primer3 v.0.4.0 [55]. Primers used for MHIIβ sequencing are provided in Table 3 and their locations on the seahorse MHIIβ gene are indicated in Figure 1.To amplify MHIIβ, we used long-range PCR under the following conditions: 1× ThermoPol reaction buffer (NEB), 1.2 μM dNTPs, 0.9 μM of each primer, 1.5 U of a 1:20 Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) and Taq DNA Polymerase (NEB) mixture and approx. 60 ng DNA per 30 μL reaction. PCR running conditions involved an initial denaturation at 92°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 92°C for 30 sec, 58°C for 30 sec and 68°C for 0.5 - 4 min (depending on product length), with a final extension at 68°C for 5 - 15 min.As the initial primer set provided only a fragment of the MHIIβ locus, genome walking was used to complete the sequence using a protocol modified from the Universal GenomeWalker Kit (Clontech). One μg of high-quality genomic DNA was digested separately with 10 U of the enzymes EcoRV (NEB), PvuII (NEB), StuI (NEB), DraI (NEB), AluI (Promega), HincII (NEB) and Cac8I (NEB) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Purification of digested DNA and adaptor ligation followed the Clontech protocol. Genome walking was performed using a nested PCR approach with 1× ThermoPol reaction buffer, 1 μM dNTPs, 0.4 μM AP1 primer, 0.4 μM gene-specific primer 1, 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (NEB) and 1 μL of the DNA-adaptor-library in a 20 μL reaction volume for the first round PCR. The nested PCR was performed using the same protocol, but with the AP2 primer and a nested gene-specific primer along with 1 μL of a 1:50 dilution of the initial PCR product. Cycling conditions were identical in both PCRs, with 2 min at 92°C, 30 cycles of 30 sec at 92°C, 30 sec at 57°/60°/63°C and 3 min at 68°C.PCR products were purified for sequencing using either a MultiScreen PCR filter plate (Millipore), gel-purification with the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega), or via cloning with a Topo TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturers' recommendations. 10-20 positive colonies per plate were picked into 25 μL of ddH20, directly PCR-amplified and sequenced. Cloned products were compared to direct sequences generated with several different primer combinations, in order to identify allelic phase and to identify any cloning-mediated PCR artifacts. Purified PCR products were prepared for sequencing by adding 1 μL Big Dye v3.1 Terminator Cycle Sequencing mixture (Applied Biosystems) and 1 μL primer to 2-8 μl of purified product in a 10 μL volume. Cycling conditions were 30 cycles of 10 sec at 96°C, 5 sec at 50°C and 4 min at 60°C. Ethanol-purified products were sequenced on an ABI 3730 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems).To determine whether MHIIβ sequences obtained from genomic DNA represent functional alleles, we amplified and sequenced a partial MHIIβ cDNA sequence (exon 2 - 5) from liver, muscle and pouch tissue of a reproductively mature non-pregnant male seahorse. RNA was extracted using TRIZOL® Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers' recommendations. One μg of purified RNA was digested with 9 μL of DNase I (Promega) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with 1 μL ImProm II Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) using 2 μL of a 500 μg/μL solution of a dT-adaptor primer (TAGGAATTCTCGAGCGGCCGCTTTTTTTTTTTT) in 25 μL volume. The program for the RT-PCR followed the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega). 3 μL of a 1:2 dilution of Millipore-purified cDNA was used as template in a PCR reaction with MHIIb-E1F2 and MHIIb-E6R under the standard PCR conditions outlined above.Genomic DNA and cDNA sequencing indicate that H. abdominalis possesses a single functional MHIIβ gene (see below). To further explore this pattern, we screened cDNA libraries of seahorse pouch and reference tissues from pregnant and non-pregnant individuals for the presence of MH genes using 454 sequencing. Briefly, both normalized and unnormalized cDNA libraries prepared from purified total RNA derived from the pouch tissues of a single pregnant and non-pregnant seahorse, together with a pool of normalized reference tissues from the pregnant individual (brain, gills, liver, heart, kidney and testes), were individually MID-tagged with a unique sequence identifier. MID-tagged libraries were sequenced using GS FLX Titanium Chemistry (Roche), following the manufacturer's recommendations. A full plate of 454 sequencing yielded a total of 850 K filtered reads (average read length 230 bp), 92% of which could be assembled into 38 K contigs. The full results of this transcriptome screen will be described in detail elsewhere (Gauthier MEA, Stölting KN and Wilson AB, in prep.).In order to investigate the hypervariable PBR of MHIIβ, complete exon 2 sequences were amplified in an additional 100 individuals as part of a larger study investigating MH-based mate choice preferences in the seahorse. Seahorses are listed under Appendix II of the United Nations Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), and the majority of the samples included here thus originate from a captive-bred population derived from individuals collected from several sex-role reversed Tasmanian populations. The seahorses in this captive-bred population are held in large communal breeding tanks (2,100 L) with 50 males and 50 females per tank, allowing free mate choice (Hawkins R, pers. comm.). This population is genetically diverse (20 - 29 alleles per microsatellite locus; n = 4 loci) and an individual-based assignment test indicates the existence of a single Tasmanian population of captive-bred and wild-caught individuals (Structure: Pr(K = 1) = 1; see Additional file 1). A global test of microsatellite data failed to reject the null-hypothesis of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in this population (HWE Exact Test: p = 0.21). In addition to 95 individuals from the captive-bred population, we obtained complete exon 2 sequences from 5 wild-caught seahorses from Sydney, Australia (2 individuals collected in 2003) and Tasmania (3 individuals collected from 3 populations in 2003 and 2004). Genomic DNA from these individuals was extracted from fin clips using a DNeasy 96 Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). PCR products for exon 2 were generated using either primer MHIIb-E1F2 or MHIIb-I1F together with primer MHIIb-I2R4 (see PCR conditions above) and directly sequenced. Sequencing results were identical using either primer combination (data not shown). All private haplotypes were sequenced in a minimum of 2 independent runs in order to reduce the possibility of PCR artifacts. Degenerate positions in heterozygote sequences were scored using IUPAC nomenclature to facilitate the inference of allelic phase (see below).We obtained exon 2 sequences from 47 F1 individuals from 5 families (n = 8-13 per family), to investigate whether MH alleles segregate in a Mendelian fashion. This approach demonstrates the mode of inheritance of these loci and provides a means to evaluate the reliability of sequence profiles generated for this fragment of the MHIIβ gene, through parent-offspring comparisons.Sequence data were assembled using Sequencing Analysis 5.2 (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were aligned with Muscle v.4.0 [56] and verified by eye in BioEdit v.7.0.9 [54]. To investigate the peptide binding region (PBR), we analysed 270 bp sequences of exon 2 (total length: 273 bp) after omitting the first 2 nucleotides and the final nucleotide of exon 2, to obtain a complete reading frame. As all exon 2 alleles are derived from a single MHIIβ locus (see below), they are named Hiab-DAB-E2*01-17, following standard terminology [57]. MH haplotypes of each individual were inferred from degenerate sequence data using a Bayesian statistical method implemented in PHASE v.2.1 using the default parameters [58], an approach which allows the determination of allelic phase from degenerate electrophoretic profiles [59]. SeqPHASE was used to convert between the PHASE input/output file and the sequence alignment [60].DnaSP v.4.90.1 [61] was used to calculate standard estimates of genetic diversity. To visualize relationships among the different exon 2 alleles and the non-synonymous substitutions separating them, a haplotype network was prepared using TCS v.1.21 [62]. The conversion of the sequence alignment file into a TCS-file was done with FaBox v.1.35 [63] and the final network was prepared using yED v.3.2.0.1 [64]. Tests for Hardy Weinberg equilibrium were performed in Genepop on the web [65, 66] using the default settings for the Markov Chain search. The analysis of non-random associations of alleles was performed using non-parametric simulations (10,000 permutations), incorporating empirical allele frequencies, with the Monte Carlo simulation function in PopTools v.3.0.6 [67]. 95% confidence intervals of simulated data provided an estimate of expected frequencies of allelic combinations.dN and dS were calculated using Mega v.4.0.2 [68] under a Jukes-Cantor model. Mega v.4.0.2 [68] was also used to test for positive selection in the dataset, applying a Z-test under a Jukes-Cantor model (10,000 permutations). Site-specific positive selection was inferred using Codeml, implemented in the PAML v.4.2b package [69]. Codeml tests the goodness of fit of codon substitution models to a dataset using maximum likelihood. A neighbor-joining tree was generated for the 17 exon 2 alleles using Neighbor v.3.5c [70] under default settings, as implemented in BioEdit v.7.0.9. We compared the fit of a neutral evolution model with recombination (M7) with one allowing for positive selection (M8), using a likelihood-ratio test (LRT). Most previous studies on patterns of variation at vertebrate MHC loci have used the original human crystallographic structure of MHCIIβ prepared by Brown et al. [10] to infer putative peptide binding sites. More recently, Reche and Reinherz [50] presented an updated model of human PBS based on a larger sampling of potential peptides. In order to facilitate comparisons with previous studies, codons of the seahorse PBR were inferred through homology modeling to both of these datasets (see Figure 4). Given the more comprehensive dataset included in the Reche and Reinherz paper [50], PBS inferences in future studies should place greater emphasis on this work.Recombination in the seahorse exon 2 dataset was tested using the default settings of RECCO v.0.93 (10,000 permutations) [71]. The identification of recombinant alleles with RECCO is based on a minimal cost solution, in which the relative cost of obtaining a sequence in an alignment from the other sequences by mutation and recombination is evaluated.Andersson M: Sexual selection. 1994, Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University PressGoogle Scholar

View our privacy policyTo investigate how estrogen and androgen affect each other in inducing sex reversal in the medaka, O. Iatipes, 17β-estradiol (E2) and 17α-methyldihydrotestosterone (MDHT) were co-administered by a convenient method for hormonal treatment, in which freshly fertilized eggs were immersed for 24 h in saline containing either or both of the two sex steroids in different concentrations and/or ratios. The minimal concentrations of E2 and MDHT sufficient to induce the maximal rate of sex reversal from male to female and from female to male were 500 ng/ml and 2.5 ng/ml, respectively, both of which were referred to as the most efficacious dose (MED), and each equivalent for the inducing potency in sex reversal. E2 and MDHT, when simultaneously administered at MED, greatly suppressed each other to induce each corresponding sex reversal. Thus, the present experimental results indicate that E2 and DMHT are antagonists that induce corresponding sex reversal, and suggest that genotypic sex in the medaka might be modified through an unknown factor of common affinity to both sex steroids, by which the pathway of differentiation of either sex could be switched at the early stages of development far before gonadal sex differentiation.Molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in artificially induced ovarian differentiation were analyzed by exposing embryos of medaka (Oryzias latipes) to a potent nonsteroidal estrogen, diethylstilbestrol (DES). Embryos were exposed for short-exposure (SE) [from 0 to 8 d postfertilization (dpf)] and long-exposure (LE) periods (from 0 to 18/28 dpf) to 1 ng/ml of DES, and status of sexual differentiation in somatic and germ cells of these gonads was analyzed at 8, 18, and 28 dpf by histology, cell proliferation assays, TUNEL assay, and in situ hybridization using sex-specific somatic and germ cell markers. Additionally, gonads of exposed fry were examined after withdrawal of DES to see whether effects of DES in exposed fish were reversible or not. DES induced germ cell proliferation and meiosis in XY fry of SE and LE groups. However, SE induced only a partial reduction in expression of gonadal soma-derived factor, the male-dominant somatic cell marker, and was not sufficient to induce ovarian development after withdrawal of DES. On the contrary, LE resulted in complete loss of such male-specific gene expression in somatic cells of XY gonads, and these gonads underwent sustained ovarian development even after withdrawal of DES. Importantly, LE to DES affected germ cell proliferation in XX gonads adversely during early stages of sexual differentiation, leading to reduced gonad weight in adulthood. Interestingly, apoptosis was not the cause for reduction in germ cell number. Taken together, these results indicated that DES exposure has long-lasting effects on the gonadal development in genetic males (sex reversal) and females (reduced gonad weight) of medaka.Sexual differentiation in vertebrate gonads is initiated by diverse sex determining mechanisms ranging from genetic [genetic mode of sex determination (GSD)] to environmental (environmental mode of sex determination). Among vertebrates, teleost fishes exhibit both GSD and environmental mode of sex determination modes of sex determination, rendering them as ideal models for studying interplay between these two mechanisms. Estrogens play a key role in differentiation of the ovaries of nonmammalian vertebrates, including teleosts (1–3); and thus, initiation of sexual differentiation in their gonads remains susceptible to influences from several estrogenic agents and endocrine disruptors. Many studies have shown that genetic males of several gonochoristic teleosts with GSD mechanisms developed ovaries when the embryos were exposed to estradiol-17β (E2) or 17α-ethynylestradiol (1, 2). These studies in general analyzed the changes in gene expression pattern or alterations in germ cell morphology with respect to the sexual phenotype. Several somatic and germ cell-specific genes like doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1 (dmrt1), cytochrome P450 aromatase, ovarian form (cyp19a1), and synaptonemal complex protein 3 (scp3) have been found to change according to sexual phenotype of the developing gonads during artificially induced ovarian differentiation (1, 4, 5). However, it remains unresolved how estrogenic chemicals disrupt the default GSD program of the genetic males and initiate formation of ovaries. Furthermore, many inconsistencies and discrepancies exist among different species especially in the stages of development that are sensitive to estrogens.The small gonochoristic teleost, Oryzias latipes (Japanese medaka) with an XY/XX male heterogametic mode of sex determination like the eutherian mammals is an exemplary model for studies related to artificially induced sexual differentiation. In this species, the presence or absence of the male sex-determining gene, DM-domain gene on the Y chromosome (dmy)/dmrt1bY (6, 7), directs the indifferent gonads into either the testicular or ovarian pathway of development, respectively. According to the available information, the first noticeable sign of sexual difference in medaka is the initiation of dmy expression exclusively in the somatic cells surrounding the germ cells of XY gonads, at stage 36 [6 d postfertilization (dpf)] (6, 8). Initiation of dmy expression is followed by stoppage of further differentiation of primordial germ cells (PGCs) in XY gonads, whereas in XX gonads, PGCs start to differentiate actively by undergoing mitotic, as well as meiotic, divisions in the absence of dmy. Despite the presence of dmy, estrogenic agents can drive primordial gonads of genetic males toward ovarian development (4, 9). However, these reports claimed that E2 does not have any effect on early sexual differentiation in medaka XY gonads, because PGCs in these gonads exposed to exogenous E2 remained dormant like those of normal XY gonads. According to these reports, this effect was probably because of the actively transcribed dmy even in the presence of an excess amount of E2. Reportedly, these gonads started to change toward ovarian differentiation pathway after hatching. However, dmy expression was unaltered (9), suggesting that ovarian development was compatible with its expression. Moreover, when dmy was knocked down in XY gonads, PGCs were found to be entering into mitosis and meiosis exactly like in XX gonads. Therefore, it remains unclear whether E2 induces female sex differentiation synchronously in both somatic and germs cells or whether differentiating germ cells in E2-treated XY gonads feminize the dmy-expressing somatic cells later. Absence of an early sex-specific marker exclusive to the somatic cells made it impossible to carry out such studies until recently. Medaka homologue of rainbow trout gonadal soma-derived factor (gsdf) has recently been cloned from medaka, and it was shown to be up-regulated at 6 dpf exclusively in the XY gonads (10). More interestingly, gsdf transcripts were found to be coexpressed with dmy in the gonadal somatic cells of genetic males, and above all, male-specific up-regulation of gsdf during embryogenesis was abolished by exposure of the embryos to E2, making it an ideal marker for studying the direction of somatic cell differentiation in medaka.The present study was carried out to investigate the process of gonadal sexual differentiation in somatic and germ cells of medaka XY and XX gonads by giving an emphasis to the feminization process in these two cell types in response to an estrogenic agent. We used a very potent nonsteroidal synthetic estrogen, diethylstilbestrol (DES), which is also a proven endocrine disruptor (as reviewed in Ref. 11), to treat the medaka embryos. DES has been used as a model estrogenic agent, as well as an endocrine disruptor, widely by studies in the field of reproduction and carcinogenesis. In utero exposure to DES caused adverse effects on male and female reproductive tracts in human, causing developmental anomalies even in subsequent generations (12–14). Although DES was demonstrated to be effective in inducing female-specific pattern of development in fish species (15, 16), the mechanism by which it influences the early sexual differentiation events has not been studied in detail. In fact, DES-induced pathologies remain poorly characterized in species other than mammals. Female sexual differentiation in medaka progresses in a step-wise manner, and each step is characterized by distinct morphological changes in gonads. Therefore, we exposed the fertilized XY and XX embryos for different time regimens based on the landmark stages during female sexual differentiation to delineate the effects of DES on each morphological event. Gonadal sex differentiation in the exposed fry was analyzed at a later point after the withdrawal of DES to test whether DES has long-lasting effects on gonadal development and reproduction (for detailed description on exposure, please see Material and Methods and Fig. 1). Effect of DES on initiation of sexual differentiation and further gonadal development in XY and XX medaka was analyzed by histology and cell proliferation assays. To understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms associated with the action of DES, we analyzed the marker genes that express sex specifically in somatic and germ cells by in situ hybridization (ISH) and real-time PCR. We found that DES exposure has long-lasting effects on the gonadal development in both sexes of medaka.Treatment strategy. A, Sexual differentiation in XY and XX gonads of medaka fish. Stage-wise land marks in gonadal sex differentiation of XY and XX embryos are indicated by open rectangles. Arabic numbers in rectangles denote days after fertilization. At 6 dpf, dmy expression is initiated exclusively in XY gonads, and subsequently, PGCs in these gonads undergo mitotic arrest, XY and XX larvae hatch at 8 dpf, and germ cells in XX gonads enter into meiosis at this stage. Further, between 8 and 18 dpf, cyp19a1 expression is initiated in the somatic cells of XX gonads; after initiation of cyp19a1 expression, meiotic germ cells start to initiate as oocytes, and from 18 dpf, oocytes undergo primary growth. At 28 dpf, XX gonads contain growing oocytes arrested at meiosis-I predominantly, and cyp19a1-expressing cells appear in the interstitial regions, XY gonads show morphological features characteristic of testis by 68 dpf, and at 128 dpf, both XY and XX fish become breeding adults. B, Exposure groups. SE, From 0 to 8 dpf; LE, from 0 to 18 or 28 dpf. Stages at which sampling was done is represented as circles, presence of DES is indicated by dark straight lines, and washing is indicated by dotted lines. Dark circles represent sampling stages with DES in the medium, and white circles represent sampling stages after the withdrawal of DES.Qurt strain of Japanese medaka (National Bioresource Project, National Institute for Basic Biology, Aichi, Japan) was used in this study. In this strain, genetic sex of the embryos can be identified by the presence or absence of leucophores on the head region from 3 dpf (17). Leucophores are present on the head region of XY embryos but not XX embryos. The adult male and female medakas were set for mating at laboratory conditions (28 C; 14-h light, 10-h dark cycle). DES (Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) was used as the estrogenic chemical. The study was conducted according to the guidelines for animal use and care set by National Institute for Basic Biology.The stock solution of DES was prepared in 99.5% ethanol (Wako Chemicals). The fertilized eggs were collected within 1 h of mating and immersed in MilliQ water containing various concentrations of DES (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 ng/ml) in plastic culture plates. Treatment was done according to the design depicted in Fig. 1. The embryos were exposed for a short-exposure (SE) period from 0 to 8 dpf; and further, hatched fry from this group were divided into four batches. The first batch was sampled at hatching (SE group) for histology and ISH, whereas the second, third, and fourth batches were reared in normal water without DES until 18, 68, and 128 dpf (SE-washed groups), respectively. In long exposure (LE), embryos were exposed to DES from 0 to 18 or 28 dpf (LE groups). After stopping the treatment at 18 dpf, one batch of this LE group was sampled at 18 dpf, another batch was reared up to 28 dpf in normal water without DES and sampled, and yet another batch was reared up to 68 dpf without DES and sampled (LE-washed group). One more batch in this group was grown up to 128 dpf (LE-washed), and the gonado-somatic-indices (GSI) of these fish were estimated.Genotypic sex of the samples was ascertained by checking the presence or absence of leucophores. Normal embryos without any treatment were kept as controls and sampled accordingly. Because only 2 μl was the maximum volume of ethanol used, a vehicle control was not considered necessary. Moreover, in previous experiments, we have seen that such a small volume of ethanol had no specific effect on sexual differentiation of medaka embryos (4).Control and treated fry were sampled at various stages of development according to the treatment schedule. Samples were fixed in Bouin's reagent for overnight. Dehydrated samples were embedded in paraffin, and sections were cut at 5-μm thickness with a semiautomatic microtome (Leica RM 2255; Leica Systems, Wetzlar, Germany). Sections were subjected to hematoxylin-eosin staining using standard protocols. Gonadal structure was analyzed under a binocular microscope (Leica DMLB; Leica Systems), and germ cells were counted according to the descriptions provided elsewhere (9).Fertilized eggs were treated with 1 ng/ml DES from 0 to 8 or 18-dpf stages. Hatched fry were collected at these stages and cotreated with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (Amersham cell proliferation kit; GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Princeton, NJ) for 24 h according to the manufacturer's protocol. After a 24-h treatment, fry were fixed in Bouin's reagent as explained in the previous section. Sections were cut at 5-μm thickness and subjected to immunohistochemistry according to the manufacturer's protocol. BrdU-positive germ cells were counted under a binocular microscope (Leica DMLB; Leica Systems).As described in previous sections, fertilized embryos were treated with 1 ng/ml DES, and samples were collected at 18 dpf. Fry were fixed with 4% PFA for 4 h at 4 C and washed with 1× PBS and methanol. Fixed samples were embedded in paraffin, and TUNEL assay was performed for the detection of in situ cell death using the in situ cell death detection kit, fluorescein (Roche Diagnostics, Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), following the manufacturer's protocol for paraffin-embedded tissue. A positive control was prepared by incubating the sections with ribonuclease-free, recombinant deoxyribonuclease (DNase) I (Takara Bio, Inc., Shiga, Japan). Additionally, two negative controls, which were treated only with the labeling solution, were included. Treated slides were mounted with Fluoromount (Diagnostic Biosystems, Pleasanton, CA) and observed under a fluorescence binocular microscope (Leica DMLB; Leica Systems).Sexual differentiation status of somatic and germ cells was analyzed by ISH using sex-specific marker genes. The two earliest known sexually dimorphic somatic cell markers in medaka are gsdf (10) in males and ovarian aromatase (cyp19a1) (18) in females. Likewise, two earliest known germ cell markers in females are scp3 (meiosis-specific marker) (4) and the RNA binding protein, 42sp43 (early oogenesis marker) (19). Control, DES-treated, and DES-washed off larvae were sampled at each time point of the exposure and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde as described elsewhere (4). RNA probes were amplified from PCR products of the cDNAs of gsdf (AB525390), cyp19a1 (D82968) (18), scp3 (AB162905) (4), and 42sp43 (AF128814). These genes were hybridized to 8-μm-thick sections following the standard ISH protocols.Gonads were dissected from 28-dpf control and DES-treated XY and XX fry. Gonads of the fry at these stages were too small to obtain enough total RNA for the quantification of target genes. To overcome this problem, 95 gonads from 28-dpf control and DES-treated fry were pooled into one sample, and RNA was extracted using RNAeasy micro kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer's protocol. However, samples were not replicated due to difficulties in obtaining such a large number of larvae. For RNA extraction from 68-dpf gonads, gonads from five individuals were pooled into one sample for each group. Again, samples were not replicated due to difficulties in obtaining enough fish.Five nanograms of total RNA extracted from each sample were reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Quantitect RT kit (QIAGEN GmbH). Quantitative expression profiles of dmy (AB071534), gsdf, amh (NM_001104728), dmrt1 (AF319994), and cyp19a1 (D82968) were analyzed using SYBR Green (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Primers used for the amplification of each gene were as follows: dmy, forward TCCTATTATGGAAACCTGCACAACTAC and reverse GAAGGAGTGCATGCGGTACTG; gsdf, forward GGGCTGGACACTATTCGAGA and reverse CATGACACAGAGGAGCTGGA; anti-Müllerian hormone (amh), forward AGATGGAAGCAGCGGAGAG and reverse CCCACAGATGTTGCCCTTG; dmrt1, forward TCCTCCTACTATGGAAACCTGTACCA and reverse same as the reverse primer used for dmy; and cyp19a1, forward AGCTTATTTTTGCCCAAGGCC and reverse TTGAGCAGCAGGAGCATGAAA. Quantification of target genes were done using ABI 7000 real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). Standard curve method was used to measure the absolute quantity of target genes per 5 ng of the total RNA from each group. Quantification of a house-keeping gene as an internal control could not be included due to limited amount of total RNA extracted. As mentioned before, samples were not replicated due to difficulties in obtaining enough number of fish. Quantitative expression data were not used as the basis for making the major interpretations of this study. Rather, this data were used only to confirm the trend revealed by ISH experiments.Data shown in Figs. 2, A and B, and 3B were statistically analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparison as a post hoc test using GraphPad Prism (version 5.03;). Data shown in Fig. 2, C and D, were analyzed by Student's t test (unpaired) using the online tool (available at http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/ttest1.cfm).Effect of DES on mitosis and meiosis in XY and XX gonads. A, Effect of various dosages of DES on mitosis. Dosages ranging from 0.01 to 100 ng/ml of DES were administered to XY and XX fry from 0 to 18 dpf; germ cells were counted in each gonad. B, Effect of various dosages of DES on meiosis. Germ cells at different stages of meiosis like zygotene, pachytene, and diplotene were counted. Cont, No treatment. C, Effect of SE and LE to DES on germ cell number of XY and XX gonads at 8 and 18 dpf. Treatment was done from 0 to 8 dpf (SE) and 0 to 18 dpf (LE); germ cells were counted in each gonad. D, Effect of DES on germ cell proliferation. SE and LE to DES were done as described before, and BrdU was added to the water in which the larvae were reared for 24 h. Data in each graph represent the mean ± SE for each category, and sample number is shown in parentheses above the bars. Open bars denote respective controls for each graph, and dark bars denote the groups exposed to DES. Letters above the bars indicate that these groups differ significantly from each other at least at P > 0.05. **, Statistical significance at P > 0.01; ***, P > 0.001.Effect of DES on germ cell apoptosis. Using TUNEL technology, in situ cell death was analyzed in the paraffin-embedded sections of 18-dpf control and LE group XX fry. Positive control, Sections of 18-dpf control XX fry were incubated with recombinant DNase I. DNA fragmentation is visible as green fluorescence in both germ and somatic cells. Control, 18-dpf XX fry. No sign of DNA fragmentation was detected. DES, Exposed XX fry. No signals of apoptosis could be seen. Gonadal area is marked by dotted rectangles. Scale bar, 80 μm (for all images).First, we subjected the fertilized eggs to various concentrations of DES from 0 to 18 dpf to ascertain the least effective dosage that induce mitosis and meiosis in XY gonads. Germ cells in the gonads of control and DES-treated XY and XX larvae were counted at 18 dpf. Among the concentrations tested, 1 ng/ml and above induced germ cell proliferation (Fig. 2A) and meiosis (Fig. 2B) in the 18-dpf XY gonads. On the contrary, all the concentrations tested reduced the total number of germ cells in XX gonads (Fig. 2A). Significant reduction in the number of meiotic germ cells was seen in XX gonads at 10 and 100 ng/ml concentrations (Fig. 2B). This difference was noticeable in XY gonads also at the same dosages when compared with that of XY fry treated with 1 ng/ml DES. For further experiments, we selected 1 ng/ml dose because of its effectiveness in inducing both mitotic and meiotic cell divisions in the XY gonads.Next, embryos were exposed to DES for a short period to examine the effect of DES on initiation of sexual differentiation. There was a significant increase in germ cell number of XY fish of SE group, whereas that of XX fish remained unaltered (Fig. 2C). As mentioned before, XY gonads belonging to LE group also showed increases in germ cell number, whereas XX gonads of this group showed a dramatic decrease in the number of germ cells. To investigate whether DES was inhibitory to germ cell proliferation in these fry, cell proliferation assays were conducted by incorporating BrdU, followed by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2D). Control XX fry of 8 and 18 dpf showed more number of BrdU-positive germ cells than control XY fry. However, LE affected the mitotic activity of germ cells in XX fry. BrdU-positive germ cell count was reduced by more than 50% in LE group XX gonads. Further, we examined whether DES induced apoptosis of the germ cells using TUNEL technology. Because the reduction in the number of germ cells was found specifically in XX fry belonging to LE group, only the LE group XX fry were analyzed after exposure for 18 d. TUNEL reaction was found to be positive in the positive control samples, in which DNA fragmentation was induced by DNase I treatment. No signals for cell death were detectable in the control or LE group XX fry at 18 dpf (Fig. 3).Further, we compared the morphology of germ cells in control and treated XY and XX gonads at different stages of development by histology. Germ cells of XY fry showed PGC-like characteristics with round shape, large nucleus, and prominent nucleolus. These cells were separated from each other and sequestered within the somatic cells (Fig. 4A). On the contrary, XX fry undergoing female development showed clusters of germ cells at zygotene stage of the first meiotic phase along with single, isolated germ cells sequestered within the somatic cells. XY fry of SE group showed both clusters of germ cells at zygotene and single, isolated PGC-like germ cells. Germ cells in the gonads of SE group XX fry possessed a morphology that was identical to those of the control XX fry.Effect of DES on germ cell morphology and GSI. A, Morphology of germ cells in control and exposed gonads of SE and LE groups. Single isolated PGC-like germ cells sequestered by somatic cells are seen in control 8- and 18-dpf gonads, whereas 8-dpf XY gonads of SE groups show germ cell clusters and meiotic germ cells at zygotene, and 18-dpf XY gonads of LE groups show germ cell clusters, germ cells at pachytene and diplotene stages of meiosis. Additionally, developing oocytes are seen clearly in these gonads. Scale bar, 80 μm. B, GSI of control and treated fish at 4 months of age (128 dpf). Body lengths (BL), body weights (BW), and gonad weights were measured, and GSI were calculated. Note a significant reduction in GSI of XX fish of LE-washed group. Sample numbers for each group were as follows: control XY, 4; SE-washed XY, 3; LE-washed XY, 3; control XX, 4; SE-washed XX, 4; and LE-washed XX, 4. Letters above the bars indicate that these groups differ significantly from each other at least at P > 0.05.At 18 dpf, control XY fish showed more organized gonads that appeared smaller as the body lumen had expanded laterally on both sides, but the germ cells did not show any change in their morphological appearance from 8 dpf (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, control XX fish possessed diplotene stage oocytes undergoing primary growth. They were separated from each other and showed increasing amounts of cytoplasm. In addition to the oocytes, XX fish had germ cell cysts and PGC-like germ cells. Both XY and XX fish of LE group displayed a distinct female morphology with growing oocytes. At maturity, XY fish of SE-washed group exhibited male secondary sexual characteristics and fully mature testes (data not shown). In contrast, XY fish of LE-washed group were fertile females with female secondary sexual characteristics and well-developed ovaries. Expectedly, GSI of the LE-washed XY fish were higher than that of the control and SE-washed XY fish. Surprisingly, GSI of LE-washed XX fish was significantly reduced in comparison with control and SE-washed XX groups (Fig. 4B).Next, we examined the status of sexual differentiation in the somatic and germ cells of the treated fry before and after the withdrawal of DES by screening expressions of the somatic cell marker gsdf as well as germ cell markers scp3 and 42sp43 by ISH. Germ cells in the control 8-dpf XY gonads were surrounded by gsdf-expressing somatic cells (Fig. 5A), whereas scp3 expression was undetectable in the germ cells of these gonads. Control XX of the same stages showed no expression of gsdf, but intense signals for scp3 were seen; gsdf expression was detectable in some somatic cells of SE group XY gonads at 8 dpf, and surprisingly, scp3 expression was very strong in the germ cells of these fish. In contrast to the above results, gsdf expression was completely absent in the gonads of LE group XY fry at 18 and 28 dpf. A weak signal was detectable for gsdf in 18-dpf control XX gonads. As meiotic germ cells in normal XX gonads at 18 dpf start to develop as oocytes, the oogenesis marker 42sp43 was used to assess the direction of germ cell differentiation in XY fry of LE groups. Expression of this gene was absent in the germ cells of control XY gonads at 18 and 28 dpf, whereas it was very intense in control XX gonads of the same stages. Although expression of 42sp43 was detectable in the germ cells of LE group XY gonads at 18 dpf, the signals were weaker than that of control XX gonads of the same stages. At 28 dpf, germ cells of XY gonads of LE group were strongly positive for 42sp43.Changes in somatic and germ cell-specific gene expression in response to SE and LE. A, Expressions of gsdf, scp3, and 42sp43 in XY gonads at 8, 18, and 28 dpf in response to DES. B, Expression of gsdf, scp3, and 42sp43 in exposed gonads after washing DES. Weak expression is indicated by dark arrows. Scale bar, 80 μm; control, without treatment.After the withdrawal of DES, gsdf expression got intensified by 18 dpf in XY gonads of SE-washed group (Fig. 5B). In accordance with this effect, scp3 expression became undetectable in the germ cells of these fish. Somatic cells of 28-dpf XY gonads of LE-washed group did not show any gsdf signals even after the withdrawal of DES, whereas 42sp43 expression was very strong in the germ cells of these gonads.No signals were found for cyp19a1 in control XY gonads at 8, 18, and 28 dpf (Fig. 6A). Surprisingly, cyp19a1 signals were not detectable in 8-, 18-, and 28-dpf XY gonads of SE and LE groups when the treatment was going on. Expression of cyp19a1 was not detectable in the gonads of control and SE group XX fry at 8 dpf. Control XX fish at 18 dpf was showing expression of cyp19a1 exclusively in somatic cells located on the ventral periphery of the gonads. However, 18-dpf XX fish of LE group did not show cyp19a1 signals in the gonadal somatic cells. At 28 dpf, cyp19a1-expressing cells were observed in interstitial regions between the oocytes in control XX gonads, and additionally, a very weak expression was seen in somatic cells surrounding the oocytes of these fish. But expression of cyp19a1 was not observed in the gonads of 28-dpf XX fry belonging to LE group. Next, we examined whether cyp19a1 expression was recoverable after the withdrawal of DES. When checked at 18 dpf, XY gonads of SE-washed group lacked cyp19a1 expression (Fig. 6B). On the other hand, 28-dpf XY fish from LE-washed group showed positive signals for cyp19a1 after the withdrawal of DES at 18 dpf. In the case of XX fish, cyp19a1 expression was observable in gonads of SE- and LE-washed groups at 18 and 28 dpf, respectively. Nevertheless, both XY and XX fry of the washed groups showed expression of cyp19a1 only on the ventral periphery of the gonads at 28 dpf. No cyp19a1-expressing cells were found in the interstitial regions of these gonads.Expression of cyp19a1 in control and various treatment groups. A, Expression of cyp19a1 in 8-, 18-, and 28-dpf XY and XX gonads in response to DES. B, Expression of cyp19a1 in exposed gonads after withdrawal of DES. Scale bar, 80 μm.We further analyzed the quantitative expression pattern of cyp19a1 by real-time PCR. Very low levels of cyp19a1 transcripts were found in control and LE group XY gonads at 28 dpf (Fig. 7A); cyp19a1 transcript levels were high in 28-dpf control XX gonads; however, XX gonads of the same stage belonging to LE group showed lesser quantity of transcripts for cyp19a1. We further checked whether cyp19a1 transcript levels were recovered later in adulthood after the withdrawal of DES, by real-time PCR. XY and XX fish recovered from SE and LE groups were sampled at 68 dpf. XY fry of control and SE-washed group showed extremely low levels of cyp19a1 transcripts (Fig. 7B). High expression levels of cyp19a1 were seen in XY gonads of LE-washed group at 68 dpf. At 68 dpf, cyp19a1 expression was very high in XX gonads of control and SE-washed groups. However, transcript levels of cyp19a1 in XX gonads of LE-washed group were comparatively lesser than that of the control females.Quantification of cyp19a1 expression in LE group fish under treatment and after withdrawal. A, cyp19a1 in 18-dpf XY and XX gonads of LE group. For quantification of cyp19a1 in treated fish, gonads from 95 embryos were pooled for each sex, RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed, and copy number of mRNA per 5 ng total RNA was measured using standard curve method; regression coefficient was between 0.99 and 1. B, cyp19a1 expression in 68-dpf gonads of SE- and LE-washed groups. Gonads from five individuals were pooled into one sample in each group, and RNA was extracted. Open bars represent controls, and dark bars indicate treatment groups. SE- and LE-washed groups are indicated by gray bars. Data shown here are the mean of reactions run in triplicate.We analyzed the quantitative expression profiles of some key genes like dmy, gsdf, amh, dmrt1, etc., in the control and treated fry at 28 dpf; dmy expression was unaltered by DES, as already seen with other sex hormones. XY gonads of control and LE groups showed similar expression levels of cyp19a1 (Fig. 8A). No expression was detectable for dmy in control XX gonads. However, very low levels of dmy transcripts were found in XX gonads of LE group probably because of the contamination of white females with a recombined dmy in their genome. It has already been reported that 3.2% of Qurt embryos undergo recombination at the sex determining locus (17). In the case of gsdf, high expression levels were observable in control XY gonads, but a significant reduction was apparent in the XY gonads of LE group. However, the expression was maintained at a level equivalent to that of the normal females (Fig. 8B). There was no difference in expression levels of gsdf between XX gonads of control and LE groups. Control XY gonads showed increased expression levels for amh, whereas XY gonads of LE group showed lesser levels of amh transcripts (Fig. 8C). Control and LE group XX gonads had similar levels of amh expression; dmrt1 expression was high in control XY gonads (Fig. 8D). XY gonads of LE group showed reduced levels of dmrt1 expression. No difference was noticed in the levels of dmrt1 expression between XX gonads of control and LE groups.Quantification of male-specific, somatic cell genes in XY and XX gonads at 28 dpf. Gonads from 95 embryos were pooled for each sex, RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed, and copy number of the mRNAs per 5 ng total RNA was measured for the genes dmy (A), gsdf (B), amh (C), dmrt1 (D). All these genes except dmy were reduced in XY gonads of LE groups. However, expression in exposed XX gonads remained unaltered. Open bars represent controls, and dark bars indicate treatment groups. Data shown here are the mean of reactions run in triplicate; Control, Without treatment.The teleost fish, medaka, is a good model for the investigation of early gonadal sex differentiation, because the gonads of this species can develop according to not only an intrinsic GSD program but also external cues like hormones and temperature (20, 21). Here, we report the possible mechanisms involved in very early stages of artificially induced female sexual differentiation by exposing the fertilized, XY and XX eggs to a potent, synthetic estrogen DES. Effects of DES on induction of female sexual differentiation in genetic males were unequivocal in all the exposure groups, but oocyte differentiation and ovarian development were highly dependent on the length of treatment. Increase in germ cell number, germ cell cyst formation and meiosis are the early signs of female sexual differentiation in medaka. Exposure for both short and long time induced all these events in XY gonads, but fish recovered from SE group showed testicular development with functional sperms in adulthood, suggesting that effect of DES on initiation of female sexual differentiation in short treatment was reversible. In contrast, withdrawal of DES after LE did not cause reversion of the sex-reversed XY gonads to testes, and these fish possessed functional ovaries at maturity.To find out the reasons for the differential actions of DES based on the exposure length, we examined the direction of sexual differentiation that the somatic and germ cells followed in the exposed as well as DES-withdrawn fry using sex-specific markers for these two cell types. According to our recent report, somatic cells in XY medaka gonads express gsdf from 6 dpf in a male-dominant pattern (10). Moreover, its expression was found to be closely associated with initiation of testicular differentiation in medaka as well as spermatogonial proliferation in rainbow trout (22), rendering it as an ideal marker for assessment of the sexual differentiation pathway that the somatic cells follow. Therefore, we closely followed the expression pattern of gsdf in exposed XY gonads for ascertaining the direction of somatic cell differentiation along with scp3 and 42sp43 as markers for meiosis and oogenesis, respectively. Somatic and germ cells of XY gonads of SE group revealed a discordant manner of sexual differentiation by showing expressions of gsdf in some somatic cells and scp3 in germ cells. Usually, scp3 expression is found exclusively in the germ cells of XX embryos during early stages of sexual differentiation in medaka (4). Intense gsdf expression in somatic cells and absence of scp3 expression in germ cells of 18-dpf XY fry reared without DES after SE suggest that the unaffected somatic cells restored testicular differentiation in these fry. Quantitative expression analysis of gsdf transcripts by real-time PCR in our previous work (10) also showed a decline in embryonic XY gonads in response to E2, but ISH revealed that some gsdf expression was retained in these gonads similar to the present study. Absence of scp3 expression in the gonads of XY fry recovered from short treatment might indicate that scp3-positive germ cells disappeared probably through apoptosis in the absence of DES.In contrast to SE group, LE group exhibited consistent and stable development of ovaries even after the withdrawal of DES. Strikingly, somatic and germ cells of these gonads underwent female sexual differentiation in a synchronized manner as evidenced by absence of gsdf in all the somatic cells and presence of 42sp43 in germ cells at 18 and 28 dpf. Real-time PCR analysis further confirmed that other key genes involved in testicular differentiation like dmrt1 and amh also were down-regulated by LE to DES, although dmy remained unaltered. All these results reveal that direction of somatic cell differentiation was the key to stable ovarian development in XY gonads. In medaka, the somatic cells are said to be predisposed to male lineage-specific development in the absence of germ cells, whereas germ cells are committed to female development (23, 24). During normal development and sexual differentiation, PGCs of XY gonads of medaka embryos are stopped from clonal proliferation, meiosis, and oogenesis, and before this event, somatic cells sequestering germ cells of XY gonads start to express dmy (8) and gsdf (10). In contrast, PGCs of XX gonads undergo clonal proliferation, meiosis, and oogenesis, and no somatic cells have been found to enclose the germ cells undergoing clonal proliferation in these gonads. These facts suggest that somatic cells of XY gonads undergo some level of differentiation toward the male direction before differentiation of the PGCs. Hence, it is possible that prolonged presence of DES promoted further growth and development of the mitotically and meiotically active germ cells of XY gonads of LE groups, and the presence of these developing oocytes was essential for redirection of the already-committed somatic cells toward female development. Providing further support to our notion, a previous study found that knocking down of cxcr4 in medaka generated germ cell-deficient XX fish expressing male-specific genes in somatic cells (23). On the contrary, SE failed to induce ovarian development in XY fry probably because of the withdrawal of DES from the medium before initiation of oocyte growth, leaving the developmental fate of these gonads to the somatic cells that remained unaffected by DES. A previous report on transplantation of XY somatic cells from blastula embryos of medaka into XX embryos had shown that the recipient gonads differentiated as testes (25), proving XY somatic cells as the effectors of testicular differentiation.Surprisingly, LE to DES resulted in reduced number of germ cells in XX embryos (>50%), and analysis of cell proliferation using BrdU-labeling revealed that DES affected the mitotic activity of germ cells adversely. Additionally, we examined whether the reduction in germ cell number was caused by DES-induced programmed cell death of the PGCs, but the results revealed that this possibility was unlikely. Accordingly, GSI of these fish were found to be significantly reduced at 4 months of age, proving that the exposure to DES during early stages of development had a long-lasting effect on germ cell proliferation in XX females. A recent report from mouse showed that exposure to DES reduced number of oocytes and spermatogenic cells (26). Previously, also neonatal exposure to DES has been shown to reduce the number of germ and Sertoli cells in testes of rats and mouse (27, 28), implying that the signaling pathway that is affected by DES could be well conserved across the species. Interestingly, DES did not affect mitotic activity of the germ cells in the gonads of XX fry of SE group, indicating that only prolonged presence of DES was inhibitory to gonial proliferation. Although the exact reasons for such an action of DES are currently not explainable, we noticed that somatic cells of not only the XX gonads but also the sex-reversed XY gonads of LE group lacked the transcripts of cyp19a1 completely. Absence of cyp19a1 expression in exposed gonads indicates that endogenous E2 was not produced in these gonads. Thus, ovarian differentiation was apparently under the direct regulation of DES. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the negative action of DES on the mitotic activity of germ cells remain unknown. It would be interesting to investigate whether DES-mediated epigenetic modifications of genes involved in germ cell proliferation are involved in this action of DES or not.As shown by the present study and a previous report (29), location of cyp19a1 expression changes dynamically during early ovarian development. Withdrawal of DES restored cyp19a1 expression in XY and XX gonads of both SE and LE groups, but cyp19a1-expressing cells located in interstitial regions of gonads found in 28-dpf XX gonads were absent in same stage fish recovered from LE group, suggesting a delay in the development or migration of these cells. Probably, a negative feedback might have shut off the transcription of cyp19a1 to minimize the quantity of estrogens produced by the gonads because DES was already present. Earlier studies showed that treatment with E2 and 17α-ethynylestradiol to induce female sexual differentiation in European sea bass (5) and rainbow trout (30) resulted in reduced levels of cyp19a1 transcripts. Furthermore, studies using aromatase inhibitors for sex reversal in medaka (31, 32) and other species (33) have also suggested a negative feedback relationship between estrogen levels and ovarian aromatase gene. Additionally, DES was previously shown to be causing a decline in the transcription of other steroidogenic enzymes like cytochrome P450 sidechain cleavage enzyme and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein in mouse (28). Nevertheless, it remains to be proved experimentally whether DES can directly suppress the transcription of cyp19a1.DES is a proven endocrine disruptor, and the above findings suggest that DES disrupts the endogenous endocrine activity in medaka probably by replacing E2 production. It is not clear whether DES had impaired the development or migration of the cells expressing cyp19a1 during early stages of ovarian differentiation or just shut down E2 production through a negative feedback on cyp19a1 transcription. DES was found to impair the follicle development in mouse exposed neonatally (34), suggesting that the cascade of physiological processes that DES modulates could be the same between mouse and fish. The presence of functional ovaries in exposed XX fish in the present study implies that fish were able to recuperate the signaling pathway impaired by DES to a certain extent. However, sex reversal in genetic males and reduced GSI in 4-month-old genetic females of LE group proves that exposure to DES during early development had a long-lasting effect on the gonadal development in fish. In mammals, including human, exposure to DES during early development often compromised the reproductive potential in adulthood by causing gonadal dysgenesis. Our results from medaka implicate that the pathways affected by DES are conserved from fish to mammals. Further, other xenoestrogens that are currently used by the industries and pharmaceutical companies also may impair the same developmental pathway that DES acts on, necessitating more vigilant examination of these chemicals using species like fishes.In conclusion, we found that during artificially induced sex reversal, the status of sex differentiation in somatic cells plays a critical role in the decision of the developmental fate of gonads. Stable ovarian development occurred only in genetic males of LE group, which incidentally resulted in down-regulation of the genes characteristic of male somatic cells. DES induces oocyte development directly by replacing endogenous E2 through repression of cyp19a1. The presence of DES during early development had long-lasting adverse effects on gonad size of XX females. Furthermore, our research has shown that medaka could be a very useful model organism for biomedical research involving the synthetic hormones and their impact on reproduction.We thank Ms. C.

Learn about our remote access optionsIn poikilothermic vertebrates, sex determination is sometimes influenced by environmental factors such as temperature. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying environmental sex determination. The medaka (Oryzias latipes) is a teleost fish with an XX/XY sex determination system. Recently, it was reported that XX medaka can be sex‐reversed into phenotypic males by high water temperature (HT; 32–34°C) treatment during the sex differentiation period. Here we report that cortisol caused female‐to‐male sex reversal and that metyrapone (an inhibitor of cortisol synthesis) inhibited HT‐induced masculinization of XX medaka. HT treatment caused elevation of whole‐body levels of cortisol, while metyrapone suppressed the elevation by HT treatment during sexual differentiation. Moreover, cortisol and 33°C treatments inhibited female‐type proliferation of germ cells as well as expression of follicle‐stimulating hormone receptor (fshr) mRNA in XX medaka during sexual differentiation. These results strongly suggest that HT induces masculinization of XX medaka by elevation of cortisol level, which, in turn, causes suppression of germ cell proliferation and of fshr mRNA expression.

A Y-linked DM domain gene, DMY, has been isolated by positional cloning as the sex-determining gene in this species. Previously, we conducted a field survey of genotypic sex and found that approximately 1% of wild medaka are sex-reversed (XX males and XY females). Here, we performed genetic analyses of nine spontaneous XX sex-reversed males to elucidate its genetic basis. In all cases, the F1 progeny were all females, whereas XX males reappeared in the backcross (BC) progeny, suggesting that XX sex reversal is a recessive trait. Although the incidences of sex reversal in the BC progeny were mostly low, 40% were males derived from one XX male. We performed linkage analysis using 55 BC males and located a single major factor, sda-1 (sex-determining autosomal factor-1), controlling sex reversal in an autosomal linkage group. Thus, genes involved in the sex-determining pathway can be isolated from spontaneous mutants in wild populations.In vertebrates, primary sex determination occurs in the gonad and the establishment of phenotypic sex outside the gonads is regulated by the gonadal sex. In most mammals, sex determination is controlled genetically by the presence or absence of SRY/Sry (sex-determining region on the Y chromosome), which encodes a putative transcription factor containing a high-mobility group-box DNA-binding domain (Gubbay et al., 1990; Sinclair et al., 1990; Koopman et al., 1991). Although no ortholog for SRY has been identified in non-mammalian vertebrates, a Y chromosome-linked gene, DMY (DM domain gene on the Y chromosome, also known as dmrt1bY), was found to be a prime candidate for the sex-determining gene in the teleost medaka (Matsuda et al., 2002; Nanda et al., 2002). DMY encodes a putative transcription factor composed of 267 amino acids. It contains a DNA-binding motif, termed the DM domain, which was originally described as Dsx in Drosophila melanogaster and MAB-3 in Caenorhabditis elegans (Raymond et al., 1998). DMY is expressed during gonadal sex differentiation (Matsuda et al., 2002; Kobayashi et al., 2004) and a loss-of-function mutation of DMY results in XY females (Matsuda et al., 2002; Otake et al., 2006). In addition, testes developed in chromosomally female (XX) medaka when a DNA fragment containing DMY was introduced as a transgene (Matsuda et al., 2007). These results show that the DMY gene in the medaka behaves dominantly to trigger the differentiation of a testis from a gonadal primordium that would otherwise develop into an ovary. DMY is expected to function as a transcription factor; however, the target gene(s) of DMY and other genes implicated in testis and ovary determination are poorly understood.Analyses of gonadal sex reversal can help uncover the molecular function of a sex-determining gene and identify other genes that might be involved. In our previous study, a survey of 3004 wild fish from 109 localities covering the four genetically divergent groups of the medaka revealed that approximately 1% of XX (DMY-negative) and XY (DMY-positive) fish in wild populations were spontaneously sex-reversed individuals (Shinomiya et al., 2004). Examination of the progeny of 23 XY females from the wild revealed that the spontaneous XY females were fertile and had Y chromosome-linked mutations (Shinomiya et al., 2004; Otake et al., 2006). All the XY sex reversals were related either to mutations in the open-reading frame of DMY or to reduced-expression mutations of DMY (Otake et al., 2006).In contrast with XY females, the molecular and genetic basis of the spontaneous XX sex reversals remains unclear. XX males have been reported in some laboratory medaka strains (Aida, 1936; Nanda et al., 2003). Based on crossings between XX females and XX males, Nanda et al. (2003) suggested the existence of a number of autosomal modifier genes affecting sex determination. However, no locus relating to such XX sex reversals has been identified. In this study, we performed genetic analyses of nine spontaneous XX males from eight wild populations and report strong evidence for a gene causally related to XX sex reversal on an autosome, linkage group (LG) 8.Nine DMY-negative (XX) males from eight localities in Japan were used (Table 1). To obtain F1 progeny, each XX male was mated with XX females of an inbred strain, Hd-rR (Hyodo-Taguchi and Sakaizumi, 1993). These Hd-rR females were supplied by a subcenter (Niigata University) of the National Bio-Resource Project (medaka) in Japan. An F1 female from each cross was mated with the male parent to obtain backcross (BC) progeny. All fish were raised and maintained under standard conditions (27±2 °C, with a 14:10 h light/dark cycle).The phenotypic sex was determined from secondary sex characters (shape of dorsal and anal fins; Yamamoto, 1975). The genotypic sex was diagnosed from the presence or absence of the DMY gene by PCR amplification from fin clip DNA using common primers for DMRT1 and DMY (PG17.5, 5′-CCGGGTGCCCAAGTGCTCCCGCTG-3′ and PG17.6, 5′-GATCGTCCCTCCACAGAGAAGAGA-3′). PCR conditions were as follows: 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C and 40 s at 72 °C, followed by 5 min at 72 °C. The length of the DMY PCR product was different from that of DMRT1, which allowed us to determine the genetic sex using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis (Shinomiya et al., 2004).DNA was extracted from the tails of the BC fish using a Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Genome screening was carried out using 120 expressed sequence tag (EST) markers, which cover the 24 medaka chromosome pairs (LG) (Naruse et al., 2004; M Base, http://earth.lab.nig.ac.jp/~mbase/medaka_top.html; Medaka UT Genome Browser Database, http://medaka.utgenome.org/). PCR amplification of each EST marker was performed as follows: 4 min at 95 °C, followed by 12 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 64–55 °C, 3 min at 72 °C and 22 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 53 °C, 3 min at 72 °C, with a final elongation step of 3 min at 72 °C. Polymorphism between Shirone 01 and the Hd-rR strain was identified by length differences of the PCR products, restriction fragment length polymorphisms or heteroduplex polymorphisms using 9% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Kimura et al., 2004). Marker names, assigned LG, primer sequences and types of polymorphisms are listed in Supplemental Table 1. For each marker, we compared the genotype distributions of the 32 BC males and the expected 1:1 ratio using standard χ2-tests. A simple binomial model was then used for investigating the statistical significance of a departure from the expected 1:1 ratio in the genotyping data of markers on LG 8 and LG 19 in 55 BC males. These markers on LGs 8 and 19 are listed in Supplemental Table 2. The binominal model for assessing the significance of the deviation of the expected 1:1 ratio of homozygotes to heterozygotes was constructed as follows. Under the null hypothesis of no linkage, the probably (p) that a male possesses a homozygous genotype is equal to 0.5. The probability that k of the 55 males possess a homozygous genotype can be computed from the simple binomial formula:Under the alternative hypothesis that a male-inducing locus is linked to a marker locus: P>0.5. The maximum likelihood estimate of p under the alternative hypothesis is given simply as k/55. A logarithm (base 10) of odds (LOD) score comparing the hypotheses of linkage and nonlinkage for a particular locus can be computed as log10 (prob(k/p=k/55)–prob(k/p=0.5)). Supplemental Table 3 gives relevant probabilities and LOD scores for different outcomes.Gonads of adult fish and larvae were fixed overnight in Bouin's fixative and then embedded in paraffin wax. Cross sections were cut serially at 5 μm thickness and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.To investigate whether the spontaneous XX sex reversal found in wild populations is a simple genetic trait, we crossed nine wild-derived XX males with XX females of the Hd-rR inbred strain and backcrossed each F1 female to its male parent. In all cases examined, the F1 progeny were all female, whereas males appeared in BC progeny (Table 1). The male ratios in the BC were low (1.2–13%) except for one case, Shirone 01 (40%).To confirm testicular development of the Shirone 01 line histologically, we dissected adult fish of the BC line and inspected the gonad under a stereomicroscope. All females examined (n=73) had an ovary and all males (N=55) had a testis. Histology showed that a number of oocytes had developed in the BC ovaries (Figure 1c) and that testicular architecture had formed and spermatogenesis proceeded normally in the BC testes (Figure 1d) as in normal gonads (Figures 1a and b). We also analyzed the gonads of the BC larvae in earlier stages, which were derived from the crossing of another F1 female with the Shirone 01 male, at 10 and 30 days after hatching. At 10 days after hatching, gonads in 88% of the BC larvae (N=24) were similar to the ovary type seen in normal development. These gonads contained gonial germ cells and numerous oocytes at different developing stages, in which the most advanced oocytes had entered the diplotene stage of meiotic prophase (Figures 2a and c). Conversely, the remaining gonads had gonial germ cells, fewer oocytes at the zygotene or pachytene stages of meiotic prophase and no oocytes at the diplotene stage (Figure 2d). These gonads were similar to the developing testis seen in normal development (Figure 2b). At 30 days after hatching, the BC gonads could be clearly classified into two types. Eighteen (75%) BC gonads were normally developing ovaries filled with many oocytes at various stages of the diplotene stage, with oocytes at the zygotene and the pachytene stages and gonial germ cells (Figures 2e and g). In the remaining six gonads (25%), we observed gonial germ cells and somatic cells, which formed testis-specific acinous structures: precursors of seminiferous tubules in normal development (Figures 2f and h) (Kanamori et al., 1985). An efferent duct was present in the central region of the gonads.Gonadal histology of adult fish in backcross (BC) progeny of the Shirone 01 male. Gonads in the Hd-rR (a, b) and BC (c, d) adult fish.

Scale bar=50 μm.To confirm the reappearance of XX male in Shirone 01 progeny, we crossed one of the BC (G2) males again to an Hd-rR female. The G3 progeny (N=28) were all female. Backcrossing a G3 female with the BC male produced 13 males (33%) in the G4 progeny (N=40). All BC and G4 males were confirmed to lack the DMY gene by PCR on genomic DNA samples.These histology results and the crossing data indicate that the DMY-negative XX sex reversal originating from Shirone 01 is a heritable trait. The appearance of males in the BC (G2) and G4 generations and the absence of males in F1 (G1) and G3 generations suggest that the Shirone 01-derived alleles at one or a few major loci could cause sex reversal in a homozygous state. Histology showed that the effect of the mutation on the ovarian development appeared around 10 days after hatching.To search for a gene that caused the XX sex reversal, we first conducted a genome-wide linkage analysis using 120 polymorphic ESTs on a sample of 32 BC males (Supplemental Table 1). The map length of each LG ranged from 38.8 to 98.8 cM and the total map length was 1452.7 cM (Supplemental Table 1), which compares well with the cumulative map length (1436.8 cM) with a panel of 93 female meioses shown by the Medaka UT Genome Browser database (http://medaka.utgenome.org/).Positions on the LGs showing a correlation between maleness and homozygosity for Shirone 01 alleles are represented graphically in Figure 3. From the χ2 values alone, a significant deviation (0.727, P<0.01) from the expected 1:1 ratio of Shirone 01 homozygosity to Shirone 01/Hd-rR heterozygosity was observed in only two loci on LG 8 (the dark gray area in Figure 3). Two other loci in LG 8 and one locus located in the distal region of LG 19 showed rather a high value (0.719, P=0.013; light gray areas in Figure 3). Other loci located on LGs except for LGs 8 and 19 showed lower values than 0.66 (P=0.077).Scanning the genome for linkage in 32 BC males. Plotted is the frequency of homozygous Shirone 01 genotypes among the 32 males at loci spanning the linkage group (LG) 1 through LG 11 (top tier) and LG 12 through LG 24 (bottom tier). Each locus corresponds to the locus listed in Supplemental Table 1. The medaka sex chromosome is LG 1. Map distances were calculated using mapping function of Kosambi (1944). Relative lengths and marker distances along each LG are indicated. The frequency of the Shirone 01/Shirone 01 genotype was expected to be 0.5 (solid line) for chromosomal regions not contributing to sex reversal. Those above 0.727 (dashed line) represent statistically significant departures from expected values using χ2-tests (P<0.01) (dark gray area). Light gray areas indicate loci showing rather high values (0.719, P=0.013).To better resolve the location of the loci determining maleness, we increased the sample size to 55 males: 10 loci on LG 8 and 3 on LG 19 were analyzed (Supplemental Table 2). After full analysis, deviations from Mendelian expectations of Shirone 01 having a homozygous overrepresentation in BC males remained statistically significant for the loci on LG 8 (Table 2). These results indicate that a major factor that controls XX sex reversal in the medaka is closely linked to Olc01.04h (P=2.37 × 10–6, LOD=5.2). Therefore, we designated the LG 8 locus as sda-1 (sex-determining autosomal factor-1). The distal region of LG 19 was barely significant after full analysis (P=0.043, LOD=0.9; Table 2), ruling out the presence of a strong sex-determining locus.We have been conducting a broad survey of the genotypic sex of wild medaka since 2001 (Shinomiya et al., 2004) and have found 42 spontaneous DMY-negative XX males to date. In this study, we examined the sex of the progeny of nine wild-derived XX males. To obtain progeny, we used XX females of a laboratory-inbred strain, Hd-rR, in which no spontaneous XX male appeared under typical conditions in our laboratory (Sato et al., 2005). All the F1 progeny from the Hd-rR female (XX) and XX males from wild populations developed as female fish, whereas XX sex reversals appeared in the BC progeny. Because BC progeny were raised under the same conditions as the F1 progeny, we deduced that the occurrence of XX sex reversal in BC depended on genetic factors and that XX sex reversal might be a recessive trait. However, the frequency of the sex reversal was low (1.2–13%) in eight of the nine cases, which does not indicate a simple monogenic trait. Spontaneous XX sex reversals have also been observed in closed colony breeding stocks: 3.7–15.4% of males were XX in six of the eight strains analyzed (Nanda et al., 2003). The incidences of the XX sex reversal varied among the crossings, but there were no XX males in crossings between different strains (Nanda et al., 2003).Together with the present results, these results of Nanda et al. (2003) suggest that polygenic factors controlling XX sex reversal might be distributed on the medaka autosomes and/or the X chromosomes and these seem to be population and strain specific. In the medaka, the phenotypic sex (male or female) essentially depends on the presence or absence of a functional DMY. In addition to this master male-determining gene on the Y chromosome, autosomal or X-chromosomal polymorphic genes might also influence male determination in the medaka.In comparison with the eight cases of the wild-derived XX males, more XX males reappeared in the Shirone 01 line: all the F1 (G1) and G3 progeny were females, whereas 40 and 33% of BC (G2) and G4 progeny were males, respectively. These results suggest that female-to-male sex reversal is a recessive trait controlled by one or only a few major genes. Linkage analysis on the 55 BC males showed the existence of a major gene, sda-1, which is involved in XX sex reversal. χ2 analysis of the LG 8 allele distribution in the BC males clearly showed that it was significantly different and that sda-1 was located on the region closely linked to Olc01.04h (P=2.37 × 10–6, LOD=5.24; Table 2). The region was localized between two EST markers, Olc05.03b and Olb31.12a, in a region spanning 2.8 Mb (Table 2). These data suggest that the Shirone 01 allele at the sda-1 locus predisposes XX gonads to develop into testicular tissue. The male ratios in BC (G2) and G4 progeny were under 50% and not all of BC males were Shirone 01 homozygotes at the sda-1 locus (Figure 3, Supplemental Table 2). These results suggest that there must be multiple minor modifiers that affect the XX sex reversal caused by sda-1. The difference in male ratios seen among BC offspring from the two F1 females and G4 progeny might depend on the difference of composition of the modifier alleles among the F1 and G3 females used in each crossing. These modifiers might be polygenic factors, which would be expected in the other wild-derived XX males and XX males in some laboratory strains. The effects of such modifiers make fine-scale genetic mapping of the sda-1 locus difficult. To remove these effects and to perform fine mapping of the sda-1 locus, we need to establish a Shirone 01-XX/XX strain with a homogenous genetic background. To establish a congenic strain having the sda-1 region from the Shirone 01 on the Hd-rR genetic background, we have started repeating backcrosses of the XX sex-reversed males to the Hd-rR inbred females.The Shirone 01 XX male was found originally in a wild population at Shirone in Niigata prefecture, Japan. We have performed genotypic sexing of wild-caught fish from the same site every year from 2001 to 2006 and found a total of nine males from 322 XX fish. Three of these caught in 2001 were crossed with the Hd-rR strain females, and an F1 female from each cross was mated with the BC male offspring of Shirone 01. In all three crosses, the F1 progeny were all females whereas 25–57% were XX males in the subsequent generation, suggesting that these three XX males had the same recessive mutation at the sda-1 locus as the mutation in Shirone 01. For the XX males found in subsequent years, it seems that the mutant allele of the sda-1 gene has been maintained in the wild Shirone population through successive generations.In the medaka, the sex chromosomes are homomorphic (Matsuda et al., 1998) and sex-reversed XY females and XX males are fully fertile (Yamamoto 1953, 1958). The Y chromosome-specific region in the medaka is no more than 258 kb in length and DMY is regarded as the only functional gene in the Y-specific region (Kondo et al., 2006). Thus, the medaka Y chromosome is regarded as equal to the X chromosome except for its sex-determining function. Aberrant Y chromosomes with a loss-of-function mutation in DMY behaved as X chromosomes and were maintained in some wild populations (Otake et al., 2008), indicating that functional transformation from the Y chromosome into the X chromosome occurs naturally. In this study, we have shown inherited XX sex-reversal from wild populations and identified the sda-1 locus on a medaka autosome. This is one of the major factors controlling spontaneous XX sex reversal. In the Shirone 01 line, successive generations can continue without the Y chromosome and a pair of autosomes, LG 8, has taken over the role of the sex chromosomes.In conclusion, we suggest that mutations in genes that interfere specifically with sex determination might not be selected out from wild population in species having undifferentiated sex chromosomes. Such mutations can affect normal sex determination and have the potential to take the place of the current sex-determining gene. Analyses of sex reversals occurring in wild populations can provide us information about the molecular mechanisms of sex determination and will help in understanding unstable sex-determining systems and sex-determining genes in fishes.Aida R (1936).

191–195(2010)Cite this article181 Accesses7 Citations0 AltmetricMetricsOryzias latipes and Oryzias curvinotus are closely related medaka species that have the common sex-determining gene, DMY, on their homologous Y chromosomes. We previously reported that sex-reversed XY females were produced in hybrids between O. curvinotus females and O. latipes males (Hd-rR inbred strain). In this study we used HNI inbred strain males of O. latipes for mating with O. curvinotus females, and found that all the XY hybrids developed as males. To map the factor responsible for this strain-specific XY sex reversal, O. curvinotus females were mated with two Y-congenic strains (HNI.YHd-rR and Hd-rR.YHNI) and a recombinant congenic strain (Hd-rR.YHNIrr). HNI.YHd-rR produced sex-reversed females in the XY hybrids, whereas no sex-reversed females were obtained in the XY hybrids from Hd-rR.YHNI and Hd-rR.YHNIrr, demonstrating that a small region on the Y chromosome, which includes DMY, is responsible for the XY sex reversal. Sex-reversed hybrids were only produced in the presence of the Y-chromosomal region derived from the Hd-rR strain, suggesting that missense or regulatory mutations specific to the Hd-rR Y-chromosomal region induce the sex reversal.Mutations or new combinations of genes that give rise to phenotypic differences provide novel insights into genes and their functions in the molecular pathways underlying development. Consequently, inconsistencies between the genetic sex (XX or XY) and the phenotypic sex (male or female) are useful for identifying the genes involved in the sex-determination pathway. In mammals, the sex-determining gene, SRY/Sry, located on the Y chromosome, induces the undifferentiated gonad to develop as a testis (Gubbay et al., 1990; Sinclair et al., 1990; Koopman et al., 1991; Capel et al., 1993). Some human XY sex reversals with gonadal dysgenesis have deletions or mutations in coding or regulatory regions of the SRY gene, providing compelling evidence of its sex-determining function (Berta et al., 1990; Jager et al., 1990; Page et al., 1990). An essential role of Sox9 for testis differentiation was detected by analysis of XY sex-reversed patients with campomelic dysplasia (Foster et al., 1994). Furthermore, loss-of-function mutations in R-spondin1 cause XX male sex reversal in humans (Parma et al., 2006). Many other autosomal and X-chromosomal genes have been identified as having roles in the sex-differentiation pathway based on the analyses of human sex-reversal cases and functional analyses in mice (reviewed in Koopman, 2001).In the medaka, Oryzias latipes, which has an XX/XY sex-determining system (Aida, 1921), DMY was found to be the Y-specific sex-determining gene (Matsuda et al., 2002, 2007). In this fish species, many sex-reversal mutants (XX males and XY females) have been found in wild populations (Shinomiya et al., 2004; Otake et al., 2006, 2008). All the observed XY sex-reversed females had Y-linked gene mutations and were classified into two groups: a group with mutations in the amino acid coding sequence of DMY and a group with an intact coding region but reduced DMY expression during critical periods for sex determination (Matsuda et al., 2002; Otake et al., 2006). These findings show that DMY is required for male sex determination. In addition, a genetic analysis of an XX male suggested the presence of autosomal modifiers for sexual differentiation of the gonads (Shinomiya et al., 2004).Oryzias curvinotus is a closely related species to O. latipes, and also has an XX/XY sex-determining system (Hamaguchi et al., 2004). The DMY gene was identified on the homologous Y chromosome, and is only expressed in XY embryos (Matsuda et al., 2003). The process of gonadal sex differentiation in O. curvinotus is similar to that in O. latipes (Shinomiya et al., 2006), suggesting that O. curvinotus and O. latipes have a common sex-determining pathway. Furthermore, interspecific hybrids between O. curvinotus and O. latipes are viable and develop normal secondary sexual characteristics, although males are sterile and females lay diploid eggs (Hamaguchi and Sakaizumi, 1992; Sakaizumi et al., 1992, 1993). In a previous study, we analyzed the genetic and phenotypic sexes of hybrids between O. curvinotus females and O. latipes males of the Hd-rR inbred strain, and found that this mating yielded not only XX females and XY males, but also XY females (Shinomiya et al., 2006). Male fish only appeared in the XY hybrids, indicating that DMY is required for male determination of the hybrids. However, 21% of the XY hybrids were females, demonstrating that DMY cannot always determine maleness in the hybrids.In this study, we used O. latipes males of the HNI inbred strain for mating with O. curvinotus females. Unlike the results with the Hd-rR strain, all the XY hybrids developed as males, indicating that the Hd-rR and HNI inbred strains differ in their ability for male determination in the XY hybrids. We also found that the Y chromosome of O. latipes was involved in the sex reversal in the XY hybrids by using two Y-congenic strains, HNI.YHd-rR and Hd-rR.YHNI, and a recombinant congenic strain, Hd-rR.YHNIrr, derived from Hd-rR.YHNI. Sex-reversed hybrids were only produced in the presence of the Y-chromosomal region derived from the Hd-rR strain, irrespective of the autosomal background, suggesting that divergence in the Y-chromosomal region is associated with the different sex-reversal ratios in the XY hybrids.We used a laboratory stock of O. curvinotus, as well as two inbred strains (HNI and Hd-rR), two Y-congenic strains (HNI.YHd-rR and Hd-rR.YHNI) and a recombinant Y-congenic strain (Hd-rR.YHNIrr) of O. latipes (Figure 1). All the strains were supplied by a sub-center (Niigata University, Niigata, Japan) of the National Bioresource Project (Medaka) (http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/medaka/). The wild stock of O. curvinotus was originally collected in Hong Kong in 1986 (Takehana et al., 2005). HNI and Hd-rR were established from Northern and Southern Japanese Populations, respectively (Hyodo-Taguchi and Sakaizumi, 1993). HNI.YHd-rR is a Y-congenic strain established from HNI females and an Hd-rR male. An F1 hybrid male was backcrossed to HNI females for 12 generations. This strain has the Y chromosome derived from Hd-rR on the HNI background. Similarly, Hd-rR.YHNI has the Y chromosome derived from HNI on the Hd-rR background (Matsuda et al., 1998). Hd-rR.YHNIrr is a recombinant strain derived from Hd-rR.YHNI, and has a small region of the Y chromosome of the HNI strain. This region is in an interval of 1.8 cM between two DNA markers, SL1 and 51H7.F, and includes DMY (Matsuda et al., 2002). The fish were maintained in aquaria under an artificial 14-h light:10-h dark photoperiod at 27±2 °C.Genomic constitutions of XY individuals in five strains of O. latipes and sex-reversal ratios in their XY hybrids. The HNI inbred strain is derived from the Northern Japanese Population and the Hd-rR inbred strain is derived from the Southern Japanese Population (Hyodo-Taguchi and Sakaizumi, 1993). HNI.YHd-rR and Hd-rR.YHNI are Y-congenic strains. The former has the Y chromosome derived from Hd-rR on the HNI background, whereas the latter has the Y chromosome derived from HNI on the Hd-rR background. Hd-rR.YHNIrr is a recombinant strain of Hd-rR.YHNI, and carries a small region of the Y chromosome derived from HNI on the Hd-rR background. This region is in an interval of 1.8 cm between two DNA markers, SL1 and 51H7.F, and includes the DMY gene (Matsuda et al., 2002). The largest chromosomes represent the XY sex chromosomes, and the other chromosomes represent autosomes. Open, Hd-rR-derived chromosome; r and R, alleles of the r locus (a sex-linked pigment gene); Solid, HNI-derived chromosome.O. curvinotus females and O. latipes males of each strain were crossed by pair mating, and the naturally spawned eggs were collected and incubated under the same conditions as the adult fish. The hatched hybrid fish were reared for 2–3 months, and examined to determine their phenotypic and genotypic sexes.Phenotypic sex was judged on the basis of secondary sex characteristics, namely, the shapes of the dorsal and anal fins. Genotypic sex (XY or XX) was determined on the basis of the presence or absence of the DMY gene, evaluated using PCR amplification of caudal fin clip genomic DNA extracted from adult fish. PCR amplification of DMY and DMRT1 was performed with the primers PG17.5 s (5′-CCGGGTGCCCAAGTGCTCCCGCTG-3′) and PG17.6U (5′-GATCGTCCCTCCACAGAGAAGAGA-3′) (Shinomiya et al., 2004) at an annealing temperature of 55 °C. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel.Total RNA was extracted from fry at hatching using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan), and subjected to RT-PCR using a OneStep RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen). Aliquots (20 ng) of the total RNA samples were used as templates in 25-μl reaction volumes. The PCR amplification conditions were: 30 min at 55 °C; 15 min at 95 °C; 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C and 30 s at 72 °C; and 10 min at 72 °C. For DMY, the initial PCR products were diluted by 1:200 and re-amplified. The conditions for the second PCR amplification were: 5 min at 95 °C; 22 cycles of 20 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 65 °C and 30 s at 72 °C; and 3 min at 72 °C. The specific primers used were as follows: DMY first amplification: PG17.5 s, 5′-CCGGGTGCCCAAGTGCTCCCGCTG-3′ and PG17.12U, 5′-GACCATCTCATTTTTTATTCTTGATTTTT-3′; DMY second amplification: DMYspe, 5′-TGCCGGAACCACAGCTTGAAGACC-3′ and 48U, 5′-GGCTGGTAGAAGTTGTAGTAGGAGGTTT-3′; β-actin: actin3b, 5′-CMGTCAGGATCTTCATSAGG-3′ and actin4, 5′-CACACCTTCTACAATGAGCTGA-3′ (Otake et al., 2006).In a previous study, we showed that sex-reversed XY females were produced from interspecific hybridization between O. curvinotus females and Hd-rR strain males of O. latipes (Shinomiya et al., 2006), as shown in Table 1. In brief, all 138 XX hybrids were females, whereas the 140 XY hybrids consisted of 110 males and 30 females, indicating that 21% of XY individuals developed as females in the hybrids.In this study, we used O. latipes males of another inbred strain, HNI, for mating with O. curvinotus females, and analyzed the phenotypic and genotypic sexes of the F1 hybrids. The results showed that all 81 XX hybrids developed as females and all 70 XY hybrids developed as males, with no sex reversal (Table 1). The gonads of 68 XX females and 60 XY males were dissected out and observed using a stereomicroscope. All females had ovaries and all males had testes, indicating that HNI males did not produce sex-reversed XY females in the hybrids. These results suggest that the two inbred strains, HNI and Hd-rR, differ in their incidences of XY sex reversal in the interspecific hybrids.To test the possibility that the Y chromosome of O. latipes contributes to the strain-specific difference in the hybrid sex reversal, we mated males of two Y-congenic strains (HNI.YHd-rR and Hd-rR.YHNI) of O. latipes with O. curvinotus females (Table 1). HNI.YHd-rR males produced 42 XX hybrids that developed as females and 62 XY hybrids that consisted of 51 males (82%) and 11 females (18%). These findings indicated that HNI.YHd-rR males also produced sex-reversed XY females in the hybrids. In contrast, all 82 XX hybrids were females and all 75 XY hybrids were males in the mating with Hd-rR.YHNI males, indicating that Hd-rR.YHNI males did not produce sex-reversed XY females. These results clearly show that strain-specific differences in the Y chromosome of O. latipes contribute to the sex-reversal ratio in the XY hybrids.To locate precisely the responsible region on the Y chromosome, we used Hd-rR.YHNIrr, a recombinant strain of Hd-rR.YHNI. This strain has a small region (including the sex-determining gene DMY) derived from the HNI strain on the Hd-rR genetic background (Matsuda et al., 2002). In this mating, all 110 XX hybrids developed as females and all 98 XY hybrids developed as males, demonstrating that the small region on the Y chromosome has a crucial role in the hybrid XY sex reversal.Reduced DMY expression levels have been observed in some XY sex-reversal mutants of O. latipes (Matsuda et al., 2002; Otake et al., 2006). To examine DMY expression in the hybrids during the sex-determining period, we performed RT-PCR analyses of fry at the hatching day. We analyzed the hybrids obtained from crosses between O. curvinotus and Hd-rR that produced sex reversal, and crosses between O. curvinotus and Hd-rR.YHNIrr and between O. curvinotus and HNI that produced no sex reversal. In addition, we analyzed the parental Hd-rR, Hd-rR.YHNIrr and HNI strains of O. latipes. Although DMY transcripts were detected in all XY fry, the expression levels were clearly lower in the XY hybrids between O. curvinotus and Hd-rR, compared with the other XY hybrids and the XY individuals of each strain (Figure 2). Similar reductions in the expression levels of DMY were also observed in the XY hybrids from crosses between O. curvinotus and Hd-rR at 10 and 15 days after hatching (data not shown).Expression of DMY in the XY hybrids. DMY mRNA expression at hatching was analyzed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). β-actin expression was determined for calibration. DMY transcripts are detected in all the XY embryos, but are clearly lower in the XY hybrids between O. curvinotus females and Hd-rR males.Our previous study showed that sex-reversed XY females were produced in the mating between O. curvinotus females and Hd-rR strain males of O. latipes (Shinomiya et al., 2006). However, this study has shown that no XY females were obtained in the hybrids between O. curvinotus females and HNI males. These findings indicate a strain difference in the ability to induce maleness in the XY hybrids. The two inbred strains, HNI and Hd-rR, were established from two regionally differentiated groups, namely Northern and Southern Japanese Populations, respectively (Sakaizumi et al., 1983; Takehana et al., 2003). They show high single-nucleotide polymorphism rates (Kasahara et al., 2007) and differ in terms of various quantitative traits, such as body shape, behavior and susceptibility to chemicals (Ishikawa, 2000). Furthermore, a recent analysis detected many differences in the craniofacial traits between the two inbred strains, and successfully identified chromosomal regions responsible for these traits using quantitative trait locus mapping (Kimura et al., 2007). Therefore, we consider that the hybrid XY sex reversal observed in this study is attributable to genetic differences between the HNI and Hd-rR strains, and that these differences make it possible to identify chromosomal regions associated with the sex reversal.Using the two reciprocal Y-congenic strains (HNI.YHd-rR and Hd-rR.YHNI), we have clearly shown that the Y chromosome of O. latipes is responsible for the strain-specific difference in the hybrid sex reversal, as the former yielded XY sex reversal in the hybrids whereas the latter did not. Furthermore, a recombinant congenic strain (Hd-rR.YHNIrr) derived from the Hd-rR.YHNI strain produced no sex reversal in the hybrids, indicating that a small region of the Y chromosome contributes to the sex reversal. This critical region of the Y chromosome is in an interval of 1.8 cM between SL1 and 51H7.F, and contains the sex-determining gene, DMY (Matsuda et al., 2002). Taken together, these results suggest that the XY sex reversal in the hybrids results from incompatibility between the Hd-rR allele of the Y chromosomal locus and the O. curvinotus alleles of autosomal and/or X-chromosomal loci.In O. latipes, mutations of DMY are associated with male-to-female sex reversal, and many mutations have been identified within the DMY open reading frame (Matsuda et al., 2002; Otake et al., 2006, 2008). Most of them were insertion/deletion mutations in the third exon of DMY, resulting in truncation of the DMY protein. As a consequence, all offspring that inherited these mutant alleles of DMY developed as XY females. On the other hand, some XY sex-reversal mutants with reduced expression of DMY produced both XY males and XY females in their progeny (Otake et al., 2006). The entire coding region of DMY was intact in these mutants, indicating that the XY sex reversal is associated with mutations that control DMY expression. Furthermore, the incidence of XY sex reversal was correlated with the DMY expression level, suggesting that a certain threshold level of DMY expression is required for male determination (Otake et al., 2006). These results suggest that the reduced expression of the DMY transcript can induce sex reversal in a subset of XY individuals having the same chromosome composition.DMY expression first appears just before hatching, and morphological sex differentiation can be detected at hatching in both O. latipes and O. curvinotus (Matsuda et al., 2003; Kobayashi et al., 2004; Shinomiya et al., 2006). Our RT-PCR analyses indicated that the expression levels of DMY at hatching in the XYHd-rR hybrids were severely reduced compared with those in the XYHNI hybrids and in the XY individuals of the HNI and Hd-rR strains. This reduced expression suggests that the XY sex reversal in the hybrids could result from incompatibility between the cis-regulatory region of the DMYHd-rR allele and autosomal or X-linked trans-acting loci of O. curvinotus. However, further expression analyses of DMY by quantitative PCR or in situ hybridization are necessary to determine whether the DMY expression levels are responsible for the XY sex reversal in the interspecific hybrids.Similar conditions were found in mice, as XY sex reversal occurred when a certain variant of the Mus musculus domesticus type Y chromosome (YDOM) was transferred onto the C57BL/6J (abbreviated to B6) inbred strain background (Eicher et al., 1982). This B6-YDOM sex reversal was classified into three groups based on the gonadal phenotypes (Bullejos and Koopman, 2005). The first group, represented by YPOS and YTIR, showed XY sex reversal with some ovaries or ovotestes on a B6 genetic background. The second group, represented by YAKR and YRF/J, had normal testes on a B6 genetic background, although the testis cord formation was delayed. The third group, represented by YFVB and YSJL, showed normal testis development on a B6 genetic background. It has been suggested that the B6-YDOM sex reversal is caused by abnormal interactions of B6-derived autosomal or X-linked loci with the M. musculus domesticus type Y chromosome. Furthermore, expression analyses showed reduced expression levels and delayed expression of Sry, which were correlated with the degree of sex reversal in each B6-YDOM strain, suggesting that regulatory mutations affecting the timing and/or levels of Sry expression are responsible for the sex reversal in B6-YDOM (Nagamine et al., 1999; Bullejos and Koopman, 2005).As O. latipes and O. curvinotus are closely related species that are considered to have a common sex-determining pathway, sex reversal in their hybrids should arise from abnormal combinations of genes, rather than defective genes, in this pathway. Our results clearly showed that a Y-chromosomal region including DMY causes a strain-specific difference in the ability to induce maleness in the XY hybrids, suggesting that the hybrid sex reversal could result from incompatibility between this Y-chromosomal region of O. latipes and the O. curvinotus alleles of autosomal and/or X-chromosomal loci. Future analyses, including evaluation of the functional differences of DMY proteins among strains, analysis of the DMY expression patterns in the XY hybrids, and identification of the DMY regulatory elements and the factors controlling DMY expression, will help to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the DMY action and sex reversal in the hybrids.Aida T (1921).

Here, we review recent studies on gonadal sex differentiation in medaka, as well as the experimental sex-reversal models available for this organism. The accumulated literature on teleost gonadal development facilitates comparative interspecies studies. Among these, comparison between medaka and zebrafish is of special interest, because zebrafish is an undifferentiated gonochorist that, nevertheless, shares many similarities with medaka and is also used as a small fish model for developmental biology. Accordingly, here we focus on the comparative aspects of gonadal development in medaka and zebrafish. In medaka, oogenesis begins in female gonads, whereas oogenesis is suppressed and germ cells remain in an undifferentiated state in male gonads. In zebrafish, oogenesis begins in all individuals, regardless of their future sex, while actual sex differentiation begins later in gonadal development, which means that degeneration of immature oocytes occurs in presumptive males, while oogenesis proceeds to completion in presumptive females. Despite these apparent differences between medaka and zebrafish, the process of gonadal development comprises similar stages: early oogenesis, early aromatase expression, later oocyte development or loss, sexually dimorphic expression of somatic genes, and spermatogenesis. We propose the concept of canalization as a key to gaining a comprehensive understanding of gonadal sex differentiation. In this respect, the possible role of the male-determining gene DMY/dmrt1bY is also discussed.© 2009 S. Karger AG, BaselReceived: September 08, 2008

Karger AG, BaselAdvanced SearchThe medaka, Oryzias latipes, has an XX/XY sex-determination system, and a Y-linked DM-domain gene, DMY, is the sex-determining gene in this species. Since DMY appears to have arisen from a duplicated copy of the autosomal DMRT1 gene ∼10 million years ago, the medaka Y chromosome is considered to be one of the youngest male-determining chromosomes in vertebrates. In the screening process of sex-reversal mutants from wild populations, we found a population that contained a number of XY females. PCR, direct sequencing, and RT–PCR analyses revealed two different null DMY mutations in this population. One mutation caused loss of expression during the sex-determining period, while the other comprised a large deletion in putative functional domains. YY females with the mutant-type DMY genes on their Y chromosomes were fully fertile, indicating that the X and Y chromosomes were functionally the same except for the male-determining function. In addition, we investigated the frequencies of the sex chromosome types in this population over four successive generations. The Y chromosomes bearing the mutant-type DMY genes were detected every year with no significant differences in their frequencies. These results demonstrate that aberrant Y chromosomes behaving as X chromosomes have been maintained in this population.IN vertebrates, only two genes have been identified as master sex-determining genes, namely SRY/Sry in mammals (Gubbay et al. 1990; Sinclair et al. 1990; Koopman et al. 1991) and DMY (DM-domain gene on the Y chromosome) in the medaka, Oryzias latipes (Matsuda et al. 2002, 2007; Nanda et al. 2002). It has been assumed that SRY/Sry evolved before the eutherian radiation ∼80 million years ago (MYA), since humans and rodents, and all other orders of eutherian mammals examined so far, have an SRY/Sry gene (Graves 2002). In contrast to the widespread distribution of SRY/Sry in mammals, DMY is found only in the medaka and O. curvinotus, the closest relative to the medaka (Kondo et al. 2003; Matsuda et al. 2003; Tanaka et al. 2007). The DMY gene appears to have arisen from a duplicated copy of the autosomal DMRT1 gene (Nanda et al. 2002; Kondo et al. 2006) and this DMRT1 duplication event is estimated to have occurred ∼10 MYA in a common ancestor of O. latipes and O. curvinotus (Kondo et al. 2004).In mammals, sex chromosomes are highly dimorphic. The large gene-rich X and small heterochromatic Y chromosomes are almost completely differentiated. The human X chromosome bears ∼1000 genes with a variety of general and specialized functions (Ross et al. 2005), whereas the human Y chromosome encodes only 45 unique proteins (Skaletsky et al. 2003). In addition, crossovers occur only in a small homologous region, designated the pseudoautosomal region. On the other hand, both X and Y chromosomes are homomorphic in the medaka. Sex chromosomal crossovers occur over almost the entire length of the corresponding linkage groups. In fact, the Y chromosome-specific region is ∼260 kb in length (Kondo et al. 2006). In addition, the genotypic sex can easily be reverted by sex hormone or high-temperature treatments (Kobayashi and Iwamatsu 2005; Sato et al. 2005; Iwamatsu et al. 2006; Hattori et al. 2007). These results indicate that the medaka sex chromosomes are quite undifferentiated and suggest that sex determination in the medaka is at an early stage of evolution and has not reached a similar stability to that in other vertebrates like birds and mammals.Since the identification of DMY, we have screened sex-reversal mutants from wild populations of the medaka to reveal the molecular functions of DMY and identify other genes involved in sex differentiation. In the process of screening, we found a population in O-bu (Aichi prefecture) that contained a number of XY sex-reversed females. In the present study, we demonstrate that there are two types of Y chromosomes that have loss-of-function-type DMY mutations in this population and found that these Y chromosomes were stably maintained for at least four successive generations. These facts imply that in organisms like the medaka with undifferentiated sex chromosomes, the Y chromosome that has lost the male-determining function can behave as an X chromosome.Phenotypic sex was judged from secondary sex characters, namely the shapes of the dorsal and anal fins and the papillary processes on the male anal fin rays. Genotypic sex, XY or XX, was determined by the presence or absence of the DMY gene using PCR amplification of caudal fin clip DNA extracted according to Shinomiya et al. (1999). PCR was performed with the primer set PG17.5 and PG17.6 for DMY and DMRT1 at an annealing temperature of 55°. This primer set amplified a 982-bp DMY fragment and a 1245-bp DMRT1 fragment. The PCR products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Individuals with only the DMRT1 fragment were judged to be XX, while those with both the DMY and DMRT1 fragments were judged to be XY.The DMY gene of the northern population had 21 nucleotide deletions in intron 2 compared to that of the southern population (Shinomiya et al. 2004). In order to distinguish between Y chromosomes derived from XY females and that derived from inbred strain XY males, O-bu XY females were mated with XY Hd-rR.YHNI males, which had the HNI (northern population)-derived DMY gene on the genetic background of Hd-rR (southern population) (Matsuda et al. 1998), since the O-bu population belongs to the southern population. Four genotypes were distinguished in the F1 progeny (XX, XYm, XYp, and YmYp; where Ym and Yp are maternal and paternal Y chromosomes, respectively) by separating the DMY PCR products in 10% vertical polyacrylamide slab gels according to a previous report (Shinomiya et al. 2004).To screen for mutations in the amino acid coding sequence of DMY, exons 2–6 of DMY were PCR amplified from caudal fin clip DNA using the following primer sets: exon 1: PG17_103S, 5′-GGA AAC AAT TTT GCC TTG GA-3′ and PG17_102U, 5′-ACA CAA CGC ACG CAT AAA AA-3′; exon 2: PG17ex2.1, 5′-GGA GTC ACG TGA CCC TCT TTC TTG GG-3′ and PG17ex2.2, 5′-TTT CGG GTG AAC TCA CAT GGT TGT CG-3′; exon 3: PG17ex3.1, 5′-GCA ACA GAG AGT TGG ATT TAC GTC TCA-3′ and PG17ex3.2, 5′-CTT TTG ACT TCA GTT TGA CAC ATC AAT G-3′; exon 4: PG17ex4.1, 5′-CTC AGG TTT GAC TTG GAT GCT GAC CTG A-3′ and PG17ex4.2, 5′-CAA ACC AGG CCA TGA CCA TTC CGA-3′; exon 5: PG17ex5.1, 5′-CCG ATT CTA GCG GAT GAT GCC ACC-3′ and PG17ex5.2, 5′-GGG AGC CAA AAA TGC GCC ACA TAA-3′; and exon 6: PG17ex6.1, 5′-GTC ATT AAC ACA ACG CAC AAC AAC TT-3′ and PG17ex6.2, 5′-AAA AAC CAG AAG ACC CGA GAG GAA G-3′ (Figure 1). The PCR products were sequenced directly in an ABI Prism 310 automated sequencer. Two additional primers in intron 1, upDMY_D_31 (5′-GAG TGT GTG TGA GCG CAA GT-3′) and upDMY_D_33 (5′-TTG AAA TCC GAG CTT CTG AAA-3′), were used for PCR and direct sequencing of mutant DMY genes.Total RNA was extracted from embryos or fry at 9.5 days after fertilization in the F1 generation using an RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN) and subjected to RT–PCR using a OneStep RT–PCR kit (QIAGEN). Aliquots (20 ng) of the total RNA samples were used as templates in 25-μl reaction volumes. The PCR conditions were 30 min at 55°; 15 min at 95°; 35 cycles of 20 sec at 96°, 30 sec at 55°, and 60 sec at 72°; and 5 min at 72°. The primers for DMY (DMYspe, 5′-TGC CGG AAC CAC AGC TTG AAG ACC-3′ and 48U, 5′-GGC TGG TAG AAG TTG TAG TAG GAG GTT T-3′) amplified a 404-bp DNA fragment. The primers for β-actin (3b, 5′-CMG TCA GGA TCT TCA TSA GG-3′, and 4, 5′-CAC ACC TTC TAC AAT GAG CTG A-3′) amplified a 322-bp DNA fragment. A primer in exon 1, PG17_61S (5′-CGT CTG GCT TCA CCG TTG GA-3′), was used to amplify the mutant-type DMY of YwObu2.Wild medaka DNA was extracted according to Shinomiya et al. (1999). The purity and concentration of the DNA were determined using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). The DNA concentrations of all samples were adjusted to give a total of 20 ng for each real-time quantitative PCR assay. Primers were designed to amplify a 106-bp fragment of DMY exon 4 (DMY_RT_4-1, 5′-GAG GAA GCG TCT GAC TGC-3′ and DMY_RT_4-2, 5′-CCT GGT ACT GCT GGT AGT TGT G-3′). SYBR Green PCR master mix (Takara) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol with an ABI 7000 real-time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems). The PCR conditions were 1 min at 94°; 40 cycles of 5 sec at 95°, and 30 sec at 65°. To confirm that the amplified PCR products were specific for the DMY gene, their melting temperatures were determined from dissociation curves generated by the real-time quantitative PCR instrument. The fact that the melting temperature was the same for each product indicated that the same product was amplified from all the DNA samples. Direct sequencing confirmed that each product was amplified from the DMY gene (data not shown). Quantification of the copy number of DMY was achieved by comparison of the real-time quantitative PCR results to a standard curve generated from the inbred strain Hd-rR. Hd-rR DNA was serially diluted by 1:2 from 80 ng to 5 ng. The real-time quantitative PCR instrument software was used to plot the threshold cycle (cycle number of each sample that intersected the threshold line) of each sample on the standard curve of Hd-rR DNA and thereby determine the quantity. Since each sample had an identical amount of DNA as the initial template (20 ng), the DMY gene copy number could be calculated as a ratio of the quantity of each sample to that of Hd-rR. The real-time quantitative PCR experiments were repeated three times.The significance of differences among the frequencies of sex chromosomes was tested by the G-test.Previously, we performed genotypic sexing of 2274 wild-caught medaka from 40 localities and found 12 XY females from 8 localities (Shinomiya et al. 2004). The average frequency of XY sex-reversed females was 1.1% (12 of 1089 XY individuals). In 2003, we performed genotypic sexing of 113 fishes in the O-bu population (Aichi prefecture) and found 17 XY females (Table 1). The frequency of XY sex-reversed females in this population was 21.8% (17 of 78 XY individuals). This value was significantly higher than those in the other populations examined in our previous study.Phenotypic and genotypic sexes of the wild medaka in the O-bu population (2003)To clarify the cause of the XY sex reversals, three XY females were mated with XY males of Hd-rR.YHNI, and the genotypic and phenotypic sexes of the F1 progeny were analyzed (Table 2). All XX individuals in the F1 progeny were female and all XYp and YmYp individuals were male, while all XYm individuals were female (where Ym and Yp are maternal and paternal Y chromosomes, respectively). In other words, the occurrence of XY sex reversals in the F1 progeny was perfectly linked to the presence of the maternal Y chromosome. Since DMY is considered to be the sole functional gene in the Y-specific region (Kondo et al. 2006), this finding suggests that the sex-reversal mutants had a mutation at DMY or a gene tightly linked to DMY. A previous study demonstrated that all XY sex-reversal mutants in wild populations were associated with defective DMY and could be classified into two types. One had mutations in the amino acid coding sequence of DMY, while the other had a normal coding sequence but exhibited depressed or no DMY expression during the sex-determining period (Otake et al. 2006). Therefore, we sequenced exons 2–6 of DMY to identify possible mutations in the amino acid coding sequence. We found a C-to-T substitution in exon 4 and a C-to-G substitution in exon 6 (Figure 1), both of which were synonymous substitutions. Next, to examine DMY expression during the sex-determining period, we performed RT–PCR on the hatching day. DMY transcripts were not detected in F1 XYm progeny (Figure 2), suggesting that the cause of the sex reversal in the XY females was severe suppression or elimination of DMY expression during the sex-determining period, similar to the case for sex-reversal mutants from Oura (Otake et al. 2006). We designated this Y chromosome YwObu1. This mutated DMY may contain regulatory mutations in the flanking region of this gene.Progeny test of XY females in the O-bu populationDMY structure of the Hd-rR.YHNI congenic strain.

The DMY PCR products obtained using the DMYspe and 48U primer set were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. β-actin served as a positive control.To investigate the frequency of YwObu1, we performed a PCR–RFLP analysis for all 78 XY individuals in the O-bu population. Since the mutant-type DMY on YwObu1 had a C-to-T substitution in exon 4, PCR amplification using the Ex4.1 and Ex4.2 primer set (Figure 1) and restriction enzyme digestion with Hpy8I produced three bands for wild-type DMY, two bands for mutant-type DMY, and four bands for wild-type and mutant-type heterozygote DMY (Figure 3). We found 16 individuals with YwObu1 and 4 individuals with both wild-type Y and Ywobu1. These results demonstrated that YwObu1 existed at a high frequency in the O-bu population and raised the possibility that there were YwObu1YwObu1 individuals in this population since XYwObu1 females were fully fertile. Since the PCR–RFLP method cannot distinguish between XYwObu1 and YwObu1YwObu1 individuals, we performed real-time PCR for quantification of the copy number of mutant-type DMY. By comparison of the threshold cycle of each sample with the standard curve of Hd-rR genomic DNA, which contains one copy of the DMY gene, we determined the copy number (see materials and methods). We examined 16 individuals with YwObu1 and concluded that 14 individuals had a single copy and 2 individuals had two copies of the mutant-type DMY. As a result, PCR–RFLP and real-time PCR analyses could detect 14 XYwObu1, 2 YwObu1YwObu1 and 3 YYwObu1 males, and interestingly one YYwObu1 female in this population.Electrophoretic patterns of PCR–RFLP products for identifying XYwObu1. DMY PCR products digested with Hpy8I were subjected to 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The DMY fragments of Hd-rR and XYwObu1 have one and two recognition sites, respectively.Our previous study showed that all YY individuals with wild-type and mutation-bearing Y chromosomes with low DMY expression developed as males (Otake et al. 2006). In fact, the normal Y chromosome could induce male development in three YYwObu1 individuals in this population. These findings raised the possibility that the YYwObu1 female had another null mutation at the DMY locus. Therefore, we mated the YYwObu1 female with XX males of an Hd-rR inbred strain induced by high-temperature treatment (Sato et al. 2005; Hattori et al. 2007). Not only the F1 progeny with YwObu1 but also the progeny with the other Y chromosome grew as females (Table 3). These results demonstrated that the other Y chromosome had also lost the male-determining function and bore another DMY mutation. We designated this new deficient Y chromosome YwObu2. Next, we carried out PCR and direct sequencing analyses of the DMY gene using the F1 XYwObu2 female progeny. The sequences of exons 1 and 4–6 were normal. However, the primer sets for exons 2 and 3 resulted in no amplification. Thus, we designed a new primer, upDMY_D_31, in intron 1 and performed PCR with 48U in exon 4 (Figure 1). This primer set amplified an ∼2-kb fragment in XYwObu2 females in contrast to a 5.5-kb fragment in normal XY males (Figure 4A). Sequencing analysis of these PCR fragments revealed that an ∼3.5-kb genomic region including exons 2 and 3 was deleted in the DMY gene of YwObu2. RT–PCR and direct sequencing analyses of embryos on the hatching day demonstrated that exons 2 and 3 were deleted in the transcripts (Figure 4B). Exons 2 and 3 of DMY contain the DM domain, a putative functional DNA-binding motif found in DSX of Drosophila melanogaster and MAB-3 of Caenorhabditis elegans (Raymond et al. 1998). Since all the F1 XYwObu2 progeny were females, the DMY transcripts lacking the DM domain appeared to be nonfunctional. In addition, the fact that the DMY gene on YwObu2 did not have a C-to-T substitution in exon 4 (data not shown) suggested that YwObu1 and YwObu2 were generated independently. The DMY gene in YwObu2 carries a deletion of the region bound by the primers for genotyping (PG17.5 and PG 17.6), thereby raising the possibility that XYwObu2 individuals had been judged as XX. To explore this possibility, we examined all 35 individuals judged as XX using the upDMY_D_33 and 48U primer set (Figure 1), which amplified a 1013-bp fragment of the DMY gene in YwObu2. As a result, we found one XYwObu2 female. Collectively, seven combinations of sex chromosomes were found: XX, XYwObu1, YwObu1YwObu1, XYwObu2, YwObu1YwObu2, XY, and YYwObu1 in the 2003 O-bu population (Table 4).Genomic and RT–PCR analyses of DMY in XYwObu2. (A) The DMY PCR products obtained using the upDMY_D_33 and 48U primer set were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. (B) The DMY RT–PCR products obtained using the 61S and 48U primer set were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.Progeny test of YYwObu1 femalesPhenotypic sex and sex chromosome types in the O-bu populationFour types of sex chromosomes, namely two aberrant Y chromosomes with loss-of-function DMY mutations and normal X and Y chromosomes, were observed in the O-bu population. To explore whether the mutant-type Y chromosomes were maintained in subsequent generations, we analyzed the frequency of each sex chromosome type in this population over four successive generations (Table 4). We found the YwObu1 chromosome in each year and the YwObu2 chromosome in 2006. The differences in the frequencies of each sex chromosome over 4 years were not significant (G-test, Gadj = 12.542, d.f. = 9, P = 0.1844; Table 5). These results demonstrated that the mutant-type Y chromosomes have been maintained in this population. In addition, the facts that XYwObu1, YwObu1YwObu1, XYwObu2, and YwObu1YwObu2 are viable in the wild and XYwObu1 and YwObu1YwObu2 females are fully fertile in the laboratory condition suggest that X and mutant-type Y chromosomes were functionally the same and these Y chromosomes appear selectively neutral.The frequency of XY sex-reversed females in the O-bu population was considerably high compared with the average frequency of other wild populations (∼1%) described in Shinomiya et al. (2004). High frequency of XY females has been observed in Goshogawara (Aomori prefecture). We found 14 XY females (18.2%) of 77 XY individuals from this population in 2005 (M. Sakaizumi, unpublished data). All these XY females had a single nucleotide insertion in the poly (C) tract in exon 3 of DMY identical to the case for XY sex-reversal mutants from Awara (Matsuda et al. 2002; Otake et al. 2006). Both populations appear to have small population sizes and to be isolated from other populations. These facts imply that the mutant-type Y chromosomes could have become frequent by means of genetic drift due to population bottlenecks.On the other hand, the following three results indicated that the XX/XY genetic sex-determination system controlled by the DMY gene appeared to be active. First, all male individuals had a normal Y chromosome (Table 4). Second, no significant deviation from the expected 1:1 ratio was found for the sex ratio in each year (χ2 = 0.72 in 2003, 1.72 in 2004, 0.45 in 2005, and 1.1 in 2006). Third, the frequency of the normal Y chromosome was ∼25% (Table 5).Estimated number and frequency of each sex chromosome in the O-bu populationTaken together, our data demonstrated that the Y chromosome lacking the male-determining function behaved as an X chromosome in this population. This phenomenon appears to be characteristic of organisms like the medaka that have quite undifferentiated sex chromosomes.We thank Ai Shinomiya, Masaru Matsuda, and Kazunori Yamahira for their helpful technical advice and invaluable suggestions.

Fertilized eggs were exposed from either shortly after fertilization (8–16 cells; embryonic stages 5–6) or from middle embryogenesis (heart development stage; stage 36) until hatching to temperatures ranging from 17°C to 34°C. Secondary sexual characteristics, gonadal histology, progeny testing, sex-linked body coloration and gene expression were used to determine phenotypic and genotypic sex. Sex determination was unaffected by low or high temperatures in genotypic (XY) males. In contrast, genotypic (XX) females treated from stages 5–6 showed increasing rates of sex reversal into phenotypic males at temperatures above 27°C up to 100% at 34°C. Thermal manipulation of sex was ineffective after stage 36, indicating that gonadal fate in medaka is determined considerably earlier than histological differentiation (stage 39). High temperature induced DMRT1 expression in genotypic females, which was observed already from stage 36. Sex-reversed males had histologically normal testes, were capable of sexual courtship and, with the exception of fish from 34°C, sired viable progeny when mating with fertile females. These results clarify the pattern of TSD in medaka and provide important clues to understand the mechanism of sex determination in this species. They also suggest that a brief exposure to high temperature early in life could impair the fertility of medaka as adults.© 2007 S. Karger AG, BaselA growing body of experimental evidence suggests that the process of sex determination (or differentiation) in fish is quite sensitive to the effects of environmental temperature [Baroiller et al., 1999; Devlin and Nagahama, 2002; Strüssmann and Nakamura, 2002]. In temperature-dependent (or thermolabile) sex determination (TSD), the thermal conditions during a critical phase in early life can induce the formation of functional ovaries or testes regardless of putative genetic orientation. This phenomenon occurs over a broad range of environmentally relevant temperatures and appears to be not restricted to species from any phylogenetic group, lifestyle or habitat, although it is common and very marked among Atheriniformes [Strüssmann and Patiño, 1995; Strüssmann and Nakamura, 2002]. In this taxon, TSD is indeed the main determinant of the sex ratios in natural populations [Conover and Kynard, 1981; Middaugh and Hemmer, 1987; Strüssmann et al., 2003] and supposedly confers an adaptive advantage to some species (e.g. the Atlantic silverside, Menidia menidia) [Conover, 1984]. However, reports of TSD are available also on dozens of unrelated species, including many which have previously been assumed to have strictly genotypic sex determination (GSD) such as sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka [Craig et al., 1996], tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus [Baroiller et al., 1995], zebrafish, Danio rerio [Uchida et al., 2004], channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus [Patiño et al., 1996], and even viviparous species such as Poeciliopsis lucida [Schultz, 1993]. In this context, there appears to be room for the argument that some degree of TSD could very well be the rule rather than the exception among fishes, and that modulation of sex differentiation by temperature probably owes as much to the poor state of development of the mechanisms of sex determination in fish as to poikilothermy itself [Strüssmann and Patiño, 1999]. Moreover, in view of the projected trend of rising average global temperatures and ensuing thermal anomalies, the possibility of effects of temperature on the process of sex differentiation becomes a grave concern to the reproductive health of fish populations.In medaka Oryzias latipes, the first species of fish in which a main sex determining gene was documented (DMY or DMRT1bY as identified by Matsuda et al. [2002] and Nanda et al. [2002], respectively), sex is generally considered to be strictly determined by the animal’s genotype. In this case it is an XX/XY system, as demonstrated by detailed progeny analysis [Aida, 1921; Yamamoto, 1969], cytogenetic analysis [Matsuda et al., 1998], and linkage mapping [Matsuda et al., 2002; Nanda et al., 2002]. Although this sex determining system appears to be fairly conserved within the genus Oryzias, only a few species appear to possess the DMY/DMRT1bY gene [reviewed by Schartl, 2004]. Moreover, naturally occurring XX males have been found in several wild [Shinomiya et al., 2004] and laboratory [Nanda et al., 2003] populations of medaka, suggesting that there might be alternate systems of sex determination in this species. Of interest is the observation of Aida [1936] who reported increased proportions of males during hot summers, but little has been done to explain this phenomenon. More recently, studies conducted in our laboratory provided preliminary evidence of TSD in medaka in the form of synergism and antagonism between exposure to low and high temperatures, respectively, and a feminizing hormone (estradiol) during the early stages of sex differentiation [Minamitani and Strüssmann, 2003]. We have since conducted a thorough examination of the effects of temperature on the sex determination of this species. While this paper was in preparation, a report of a similar study on the effects of temperature on sex determination of the Hd-rR and HNI strains of medaka appeared [Sato et al., 2005]. That study provided the first clear evidence of TSD in medaka, showing that embryos of genotypic (XX) females of both strains developed as functional males when exposed to a temperature of 32°C between fertilization and hatching. However, no information was provided on the timing of TSD in relation to sex differentiation and on the effects of other temperatures in this process. Likewise, the molecular mechanism of TSD in this species has not been clarified.In this study, we present the results of experiments spanning the full range of viable temperatures of embryos (15°C to 34°C) on the sex differentiation of both genotypic males and females of the Hd-rR strain of medaka. We also examined the timing of sex determination by thermal treatment of medaka embryos during two different developmental stages and examined the fertility of sex reversed individuals. Finally, we examined the pattern of expression of the putative sex-determining gene DMY/DMRT1bY and of the autosomal gene DMRT1, which in medaka is associated with spermatogonial differentiation [Kobayashi et al., 2004], in order to obtain clues on the molecular mechanism of high temperature-induced masculinization in medaka.Medaka from the highly inbred Hd-rR strain were a kind gift from the Animal Supply Facilities, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan. To obtain fertilized eggs, we set up nine 20-liter plastic tanks containing 4 adult females and 2 males each. This brood stock was reared in brackish water (0.1–0.4% NaCl) at a temperature of 25°C and a photoperiod of 14L-10D. Fish were fed Tetramin (Tetra®) flakes and supplemented with live Artemia nauplii ad libitum.Fertilized eggs were collected daily within 2 h of spawning, and stocked in Petri dishes with brackish (0.1–0.4% NaCl) water and methylene blue (50 ppm) as a prophylactic at a stocking density of up to 50 eggs per dish. To assess the effects of temperature and the thermolabile period, groups of eggs were transferred within 1 h of collection (3 h from spawning, developmental stages 5–6) [Iwamatsu, 1994] to incubators (IUCHI Mini-Incubator UI-50) pre-set at 17, 21, 25, 27, 30, 32 and 34 ± 0.3°C or after a preliminary incubation period of 6 days at 25°C (until the heart development stage, or stage 36) to incubators set at 15, 18, 22, 25, 26, 30, 31, and 34 ± 0.3°C. These experimental temperatures were chosen based on empirical results on the thermal tolerance and hatchability of Hd-rR strain medaka eggs and those of Yamamoto [1975]. After 24 h, unviable eggs were discarded, the chorionic filaments were trimmed off, and the rearing water was exchanged completely for new water previously adjusted to the same temperature. Thereafter, unviable eggs were removed and the water was exchanged every 48 h until hatching.Hatched larvae were immediately separated into groups according to their incubation temperature and reared under the same standard conditions as for brood stock until reaching sexual maturity at about 2–3 months. No attempt was made to discriminate between larvae from different spawnings or parents within the same temperature incubation group because of the high degree of inbreeding of the brood stock. After attaining sexual maturity, each fish was analyzed to determine its phenotypic and genotypic sex. Phenotypic sex was determined by observation of secondary sexual characteristics in fin morphology and anal papilla under a stereomicroscope following identification criteria of Yamamoto [1975] and Iwamatsu [1999]. Phenotypic sex was also examined by light histological analysis of the gonads in selected individuals to confirm the findings of the observation of secondary sex characteristics. For this purpose, fish were fixed in Bouin’s solution for 24 h and preserved in 70% ethanol. The trunk region containing the gonads was then processed for histological analysis by routine histological methods. Sagittal histological sections of 6 µm of thickness were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and examined under a microscope. The genetic sex of each individual was identified by two methods. First, we observed each fish under the stereomicroscope concomitant with the determination of secondary sexual characteristics and scored the genetic sex based on body pigmentation. This is possible in the Hd-rR strain of medaka because inheritance of sex and body pigmentation are linked: genotypic (XX) females are white and genotypic (XY) males are orange-red [Yamamoto, 1975].Second, animals were subjected to DNA analysis for the presence of the DMY/DMRT1bY gene. For this purpose, we collected a piece of the caudal fin of all individuals sacrificed for histology and extracted their total DNA using the DNeasy® Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). A PCR analysis was then performed using 4 sets of primers (table 1) to cover the DMY gene in its entirety. β-Actin was amplified as a positive control in the case of primers EX3.1/3.2, EX6.1/6.2, and DMT1K/DMT1l, since genetic females do not show any band with them. The PCR products were analyzed on a 0.9% agarose gel.Primers used in the analysis of genotypic sexFor the progeny and fertility test, selected sex-reversed males (genotypic females; see below) from the 32 and 34°C groups were mated individually to control brood stock females that were reared throughout at 25°C and which had proven fertility records. Eggs were collected daily and checked for fertilization and development. All other rearing procedures for the progeny test were the same as those described above.Offspring from the cross of control (XX) females with control (XY) and sex-reversed (XX) males from the 32°C group was incubated from fertilization to hatching at 25°C and 32°C, respectively. Twelve embryos were sampled from each group at developmental stages 36 and 39 (hatching) and individually analyzed for DMY/DMRT1bY and DMRT1 gene expression by reverse transcription-PCR analysis following the primers and methods of Nanda et al. [2002].Eggs that were incubated at 17 and 34°C from immediately after fertilization hatched in approximately 25 and 7 days, respectively. These results match the developmental times for these temperatures and the thermal tolerance of medaka embryos reported by Yamamoto [1975]. However, we noted that embryos incubated at high temperatures, particularly at 34°C, frequently showed abnormal embryonic development. The most common types of abnormalities were those in the nervous system such as deformed and atrophied brains, small or missing eyes, and general cranial deformities, and these developmental problems likely led to the reduced viability observed in these groups. Nevertheless, embryos with milder degrees of deformities were in general able to hatch, start exogenous feeding, and grow until adulthood, and these were the animals that were sexed and submitted to progeny testing as described below.Determination of genotypic and phenotypic sex in sexually mature individuals from all groups was first performed non-destructively by examination of body color and secondary sexual characters, respectively. The results of these analyses were then confirmed by gene amplification and histology, respectively. Overall, the results of sex ratios compiled in table 2 clearly indicate that temperature treatment caused sex reversal from genotypic female into phenotypic male at the highest temperatures (30, 32 and 34°C). We also observed two sex reversed males at the temperature of 27°C but, since most fish in this group were accidentally lost, the actual proportion of sex reversal in this group could not be calculated. Determination of genotypic sex from body color was very accurate as all XX individuals, including sex reversed males and normal females, showed only the autosomal DMRT1 fragment by amplification with primers PG17.5 and 17.6 and none with the other three primer sets (fig. 1). The XX genetic makeup of sex reversed males was also confirmed in the progeny testing, as they sired all female (XX) progeny when mated to control females (results not shown). In genotypic males, however, primers PG17.5 and 17.6 amplified two fragments, a larger one (∼1 kb) corresponding to DMRT1 and a smaller one (∼0.7 kb) corresponding to DMY/DMRT1bY. In these animals, a single band corresponding to DMY/DMRT1bY was also amplified with the other three primer sets (fig. 1).Frequencies of sex phenotypes per incubation temperature, timing (embryonic stage) of treatment, and genotypic sex in Hd-rR strain medakaGenetic screening of normal and sex reversed medaka by amplification of DMY/DMRT1bY using the primers P17.5 and P17.6 (a) and E3.1 and 3.2 (b). Note that for the first set of primers the autosomal DMRT1 is also amplified. The positive control for primers E3.1 and 3.2 (β-actin) is shown in c. The other two primer sets produced the same pattern as found in b. M = Molecular weight marker.The proportion of sex-reversal of genotypic females at the temperature of 32°C obtained in this study (40%) was grossly equivalent to that reported by Sato et al. [2005] for the same temperature (24%) if slight differences in temperature between the two experiments are taken into consideration. This study, however, shows for the first time that the efficiency of sex reversal by temperature in genotypic females of Hd-rR medaka increases proportionally with temperature above 27°C, reaching 100% at 34°C (table 2). On the contrary, our results suggest that sex differentiation in genotypic (XY) males is greatly resilient to thermal effects, as sex-reversed females were not found in any of the temperature groups. This was rather surprising, as we expected to find also sex reversal at the low temperatures. Our expectation was based on studies showing that the expression of various genes purportedly involved in the process of sex differentiation in fish is affected by environmental temperature in a similar way as by treatment with exogenous steroid hormone treatments [reviewed in Devlin and Nagahama, 2002; Strüssmann and Nakamura, 2002]. Moreover, in support of our assumption, Minamitani and Strüssmann [2003] showed that the efficiency of feminization by administration of estradiol to Hd-rR medaka embryos increased by incubating fertilized eggs at low temperature during hormone treatment. The results of this study, however, suggest that low temperature alone is not sufficient to corrupt the putative genetic mechanism of sex differentiation in medaka although we cannot rule out the possibility that exposure to even lower temperatures (for short duration to guarantee viability) could still cause sex reversal.The above results have important implications for the discussion of the mechanism and evolution of sex determination in medaka. For example, one puzzling aspect of sex determination in this species is the paradoxical facets of the DMY/DMRT1bY gene: it is both new and old (= disappearing), and it is both sufficient but not absolutely necessary for testicular differentiation [see Schartl, 2004]. In fact, two studies [Nanda et al., 2003; Schartl, 2004] suggest that autosomal modifiers could be implicated in male fate determination in medaka. The findings of this study and those of Sato et al. [2005] add a new dimension to this discussion, as they show that part, if not all, of the masculinizing role of DMY/DMRT1bY could readily be taken over by (high) environmental temperature. Thus, whereas Schartl [2004] has envisioned the loss of the Y chromosome of medaka and its replacement by other genetic factors, we suggest that environmental temperature may actually accelerate its demise. Indeed, it is noteworthy that sex reversal of genotypic females was observed at a temperature of 27°C in the HNI [Sato et al., 2005] and Hd-rR (this study) strains, so it is possible that at least part of the F1 and F2 XX males attributed by Nanda et al. [2003] to autosomal modifiers could have been sex reversed by the rearing temperature in their experiments (27°C). Given the occurrence of sex reversal at environmentally realistic temperatures (27–32°C) and projected trends in global warming, the postulated disappearance of the Y chromosome could be even accelerated by the ‘dilution effect’, in which sex reversed XX males compete with XY males for mating with XX females, leading to a gradual reduction of the proportion of XY individuals in the population [assuming the persistence of the masculinizing temperatures; see Kanaiwa and Harada, 2002]. Thus, our results point to a new paradox concerning the Y chromosome of medaka: that it is both strong, as it is able to fend off the feminizing effects of (low) temperature, but at the same time weak, as it can be readily replaced by alternative genetic and environmental factors and unable to prevent its own extinction.A second important finding of this study was that the thermally sensitive period of sex differentiation in medaka embryos lies between developmental stages 5–6 (8 to 16 cells) and 36 (heart development stage), as thermal treatments only effectively induced sex reversal in this time/developmental window. This result conflicts with the prevailing view that gonadal sex is determined in medaka around the later half of embryogenesis (between stages 36 and 39), as implied from the results of histological analysis of gonadal sex differentiation [particularly germ cell proliferation; Satoh and Egami, 1972; Quirk and Hamilton, 1973; Yoshikawa and Oguri, 1981; Kobayashi et al., 2004]. It also contradicts estimates obtained from hormonal manipulation of sex in this species; for such treatments are 100% effective even when started after the heart development (or eyed-egg) stage [Iwamatsu, 1999; Minamitani and Strüssmann, 2003], a fact commonly taken as an indication that gonadal sex is still not determined at that time. It is worth mentioning, however, that sex steroid hormones are potent inducers of sex that can override putative processes [even in the adult gonads; Bhandari et al., 2006]. On the contrary, wherever it has been possible to determine the time of sex determination by other means, such as thermal manipulation of sex in TSD species, for example, it was shown that sex is determined considerably earlier than the first signs of gonadal sex differentiation [Conover and Fleisher, 1986; Baroiller et al., 1995; Strüssmann et al., 1997; Wang and Tsai, 2000]. For the above reasons, we consider that our results obtained by thermal manipulation reflect more closely the time of natural sex determination in (untreated) medaka than previous determinations using either histology or hormonal manipulation.This revised estimate of the period of natural sex determination in medaka may be fundamental for the functional analysis of the role of genetic factors in this process. The DMY/DMRT1bY gene, for instance, is considered as the prime testis-determining factor in this species, with functional (but not necessarily structural) analogy to the sex determining genes in other taxa [Matsuda et al., 2002; Nanda et al., 2002]. Kobayashi et al. [2004] observed expression at stage 37, when the primordial germ cells (PGCs) have already migrated into the gonadal anlagen and before the appearance of a sexual dimorphism in the number of germ cells at stage 39. Expression of DMY/DMRT1bY was detected specifically in Sertoli-like cells surrounding PGCs, leading the authors to suggest that it regulates the differentiation of these cells and/or the proliferation/differentiation of germ cells and thereby induces testicular differentiation. Nanda et al. [2002], on the other hand, detected DMY/DMRT1bY expression already from the neurula stage (stages 17–18), but did not elaborate on a role at this early stage. Thus, although DMY/DMRT1bY is presumably located far upstream in the male pathway, its target genes still remain unknown [Nanda et al., 2002; Schartl, 2004]. It is notable that the early window of expression observed by Nanda et al. [2002] coincides temporally with the thermally sensitive period of masculinization determined in this study, and that both occur even before migration of PGCs and their entry into the germinal ridges. These facts suggest a similar key role for these two factors during early development, although they do not prove that the mechanism of action in both cases is the same, as for example water temperature could have cumulative effects on other genes. As expected in the absence of the gene [see also Nanda et al., 2002; Kobayashi et al., 2004], expression of DMY/DMRT1bY was not observed in any of the genotypic female (XX) embryos regardless of developmental stage and incubation temperature (fig. 2). In spite of the absence of DMY/DMRT1bY, however, substantial amounts of DMRT1 mRNA were found in 6 out of 12 XX embryos incubated at 32°C, a fact not observed at the ‘sexually neutral’ temperature of 25°C. This finding is in good agreement with the proportion of sex-reversed males found at this temperature (e.g. 40%; table 2). This is the first demonstration that genotypic female medaka embryos express this crucial gene for testis formation in response to masculinizing temperatures. Likewise, DMRT1 expression at 32°C was observed as early as developmental stage 36. This contrasts with a temperature of 25°C, where it is observed only after hatching [stage 39; this study; Nanda et al., 2002; Kobayashi et al., 2004]. Thus, high temperature greatly accelerates the cascade of molecular events leading to testicular differentiation. Further studies must examine how high temperature triggers the expression of DMRT1, if this early expression actually induces premature testicular differentiation, and further clarify the molecular cascade leading to gonadal sex differentiation in medaka.Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of DMY/DMRT1bY and DMRT1 gene expression in XX and XY medaka embryos of two developmental stages (36 and 39) at sexually neutral (25°C) and masculinizing (32°C) temperatures. For clarity, only representative results for each genotype, incubation temperature, developmental stage, and pattern of DMRT1 gene expression are shown from among the twelve embryos available for each condition. Results for adult medaka testis are included for comparison. M = Molecular weight marker.Histological analysis of sex-reversed males from the high temperature groups revealed that their testes were morphologically normal, presenting the characteristic tubular organization and cysts of germ cells (spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatozoa) [Kanamori et al., 1985], and were undistinguishable from those of males from the control group (25°C; fig. 3). We did not find any differences between females from the various groups either and intersex features were never observed. The progeny tests showed that sex-reversed males from the 32 and 34°C groups were capable of normal sexual courtship but only animals from the former treatment produced viable offspring. The fertility of animals from 32°C agrees with the results of hormonal [Yamamoto, 1958] and temperature treatments by Sato et al. [2005], who showed that XX males are in general functional, although we cannot discard the possibility that they are reproductively inferior to XY males [see Fineman et al., 1975]. The infertility of sex reversed males from the 34°C treatment, on the other hand, resembles in all respects the infertile XX males observed by Yamamoto [1958] after hormonal manipulation in that they had normal testicular histology, produced mature spermatozoa, mated actively, but did not sire viable progeny. In the present study, it might represent a problem of orchestration between the neural system and the gonads since fish at the highest temperatures frequently showed cranial and brain abnormalities. This possibility and that of genotoxic effects of heat [Anitha et al., 2000] should be examined in further studies.Sagittal histological sections of gonads from normal female (a, b), normal male (c, d) and sex-reversed male from the 34°C treatment (e, f). Figures on the left and right were all taken at the same magnification. Figures on the right are magnifications of the respective boxes on the left. Symbols: oc = ovarian cavity; po = perinucleolar oocyte; og = oogonia; sg = spermatogonia; so = spermatocytes; sp = sperm cells.The results of this study show unmistakably that the process of gonadal sex differentiation in Hd-rR medaka is under the control of genetic and environmental (temperature) factors at a very early stage of embryonic development. They also reveal that a brief exposure to high temperatures early in life could greatly impair the fertility of fish as adults. Thus, medaka constitutes an invaluable research tool to study the effects of temperature on the process of sex differentiation and provides the opportunity to test the strength of a clear sex determination mechanism, which shares a high degree of homology with that of other vertebrates, in a poikilothermic context. Such studies may help to shed light on the mechanism of TSD in fish and to provide tools to forecast the impact of global warming and climatic change on the reproduction of fish populations.We would like to thank Dr. Y.

Karger AG, BaselAdvanced SearchEdited by Ryuzo Yanagimachi, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI, and approved September 7, 2007 (received for review November 9, 2006)To further elucidate the roles of germ cells in the sex differentiation of gonads, we have used the medaka, a teleost fish, to generate mutants that lack germ cells from the onset of gonadogenesis by the morpholino-mediated knockdown of cxcr4. The resulting germ-cell-deficient medaka show female-to-male sex reversal of their secondary sex characteristics, accompanied by increased levels of androgen and reduced levels of estrogen. A failure to maintain granulosa cells or estrogen-producing cells also occurs at early stages of sex differentiation in the cxcr4 morphants, before the initiation of gonadal morphogenesis. In contrast, androgen-producing cells are unaffected in germ-cell-deficient medaka of either sex. In addition, a single tube-like gonad that expresses male-specific genes is formed in these mutants irrespective of the genetic sex. Significantly, each of these mutant phenotypes occurs in a somatic cell-autonomous manner, suggesting that gonadal somatic cells are predisposed toward male development in the absence of germ cells. This highlights the importance of germ cells in the sexual dimorphism of the gonads.The vertebrate gonad consists of both germ cells and gonadal somatic cells. When these cells ultimately form the gonadal primordium, in mammals and in the medaka, the gonads develop into either ovaries or testes, depending on the genetic program (1–5). The somatic cell lineages then develop into both granulosa cells and theca cells in the ovary and become Sertoli cells and Leydig cells in the testis. The granulosa and Sertoli cells are known as supporting cells and directly enclose germ cells, whereas theca cells and Leydig cells function as sex steroid hormone-producing cells. Although mutations and in vitro manipulations have now provided insights into the molecular pathways through which each of these lineages chooses its cell fate (6, 7), little is still known about the interplay between somatic and germ cells.Specific cell ablation has proved a useful method to analyze the roles of specific cell lineages during organogenesis, and the effects of the loss of germ cells during gonadogenesis have been reported in a number of studies in mammals (8–10). In the mammalian ovary, the absence of germ cells (oogonia/oocytes) in the genital ridges does not appear to affect ovarian formation or early differentiation (11, 12). However, the loss of oocytes in the follicles inhibits the maturation of granulosa cells and induces their transdifferentiation to Sertoli cells, which harbor tubule-like structures (13–15). This is followed by the appearance of cells that produce male steroid hormones within the interstitial regions of the gonad (16–18). On the other hand, germ cell loss in the testis does not affect the formation or differentiation of somatic cells in an immature state (19–21). Recently, the ablation of germ cells in zebrafish was also reported (22), and these fish develop as sterile males with no gonadal structures evident in the adult. However, the cellular processes underlying sex reversal remain to be investigated.The medaka has also been established as a model organism that is particularly useful in the analysis of gonadogenesis. The medaka gonadal primordium is formed at ≈4 days postfertilization (dpf) (stage 33) (23), at which time the testis-determining gene on the Y chromosome, DMY/dmrt1bY, begins to be expressed in the male gonadal somatic cells (24) (Fig. 1). Other than DMY/dmrt1bY, all of the genes that have been shown to be expressed in the gonads show no sex-specific expression until ≈10 days posthatching (dph). Moreover, the gonadal primordia of both sexes express sox9b and ftz-f1 and are almost morphologically indistinguishable until around the time of hatching (23, 25). The germ cells in the female medaka gonads then begin to dramatically increase in number (25–27), which is not observed in the male gonads (25, 28–31). Ovarian follicles with diplotene oocytes become evident at ≈20 dph (29), and the expression of the sex-dependent genes becomes evident by 10 dph. DMRT1 and sox9b are preferentially expressed in the male gonads, whereas foxl2 and cytochrome P450 aromatase (hereafter, aromatase) are expressed in the female gonads (25, 32, 33).Schematic representation of medaka gonadal development from stage 33 (4 dpf) to adulthood. Morphological events are indicated by black characters. Red characters indicate both the timing and location of the gene expression tested in this study. The early stages of gonadal development include the period of cell differentiation, which should be discriminated from later morphogenic stages. Secondary sex characteristics in the medaka manifest after 40–50 dph in both sexes.Steroid-producing cells expressing genes encoding steroidogenic enzymes such as P450c17 (cytochrome P450 hydroxylase and c17 lyase) are also detectable by 20 dph in both sexes. The male germ cells enter meiosis at ≈50 dph. During the period between 30 and 50 dph, gonadal morphogenesis initiates in both sexes. The ovarian cavity in the ovary and an efferent duct and lobule structures in the testis are then formed, and secondary sex characteristics gradually become apparent under the influence of the sex steroid hormones.In our current study, we have generated a medaka strain with a germ-cell-deficient gonad by inhibiting primordial germ cell migration. The resulting adult germ-cell-deficient medaka displays a female-to-male secondary sex reversal phenotype. By analysis of the germ-cell-deficient gonads, we demonstrate that the germ cells exert multiple effects upon gonad formation and sex differentiation. The differentiation of female-specific cell lineages was found to be impaired during the early stages of gonadal development, whereas cells expressing male-specific genes were observed to develop in both the female and male germ-cell-deficient gonads. Furthermore, adult germ-cell-deficient gonads from both sexes were found to possess a single tube-like structure with an organization resembling both the ovarian follicles and seminiferous tubules of wild-type medaka gonads.To investigate the roles of germ cells during gonadal development in the medaka, we generated a germ-cell-deficient strain of this fish by injection of morpholino antisense oligonucleotides that were directed against the chemoattractant receptor gene, cxcr4 (cxcr4-MO). Previously, we have shown that cxcr4 is involved in the migration of primordial germ cells in the medaka at the gastrulation stage, and that this process is severely impaired by inhibiting this gene (34). Coinjection of an RNA-encoding EGFP with the olvas-3′ UTR, which drives EGFP expression in germ cells, confirmed the mismigration of fluorescent germ cells and their subsequent loss in the gonads at stage 35 in the resulting morphants [supporting information (SI) Fig. 5]. The morphant embryos were further allowed to grow for 2 months until they reached sexual maturity.At the adult stage, we reexamined the absence of germ cells in the cxcr4-MO embryos. Among the adult XX morphant medaka (n = 131), 68% (n = 89/131) did not possess any germ cells in the gonads. Each of these XX medaka exhibited female-to-male sex reversal of their secondary sex characteristics with well developed anal and dorsal fins, as well as the loss of urinogenital papillae (Fig. 2 A–C). Only those fish with a complete loss of germ cells were used for all subsequent analysis.Sex reversal of germ-cell-deficient medaka and its associated gonadal morphology.

A single empty lumen with several foldings is present in the germ-cell-deficient gonad. Arrowheads indicate blood vessels. (H and I) Electron micrographs of germ-cell-deficient medaka gonads. The lumen (L), basement membrane (arrowheads), and desmosomes (arrows) are indicated. A single layer of innermost cells is shaded with a pale blue color.Thirty-two percent of the adult XX morphants (n = 42/131) possessed germ cells and were fertile, indicating in these cases that gonads containing small numbers of germ cells were present but were misidentified as germ-cell-deficient at embryonic screening, possibly because of the weak fluorescence of the germ cells. Although these fish were excluded from all subsequent analyses, it is noteworthy that 26% (11/42) of the fertile XX morphants grew as functional males, whereas the remaining 74% (31/42) developed as females.The XY morphants all (n = 30) showed normal male secondary sex characteristics. The control wild-type adult medaka showed no sex-reversal properties (n = 46 for XX and 47 for XY).We next examined the gonadal morphology of adult morphant fish. Germ-cell-deficient gonads from both XX and XY morphants show a translucent and single tube-like structure (Fig. 2 D and G and SI Fig. 5C ). As shown by electron microscopy, a single layer of the innermost cells bordering the lumen of the tube-like gonad is lined with cells that are separated by a basement membrane from a region of outer stromal cells (Fig. 2 H and I). In some of the tube-like gonads, the innermost cells also develop blebs and conspicuous microvillous processes on their apical surfaces, characteristic of germinal epithelia (surface epithelia in mice) (35). These innermost cells invariably contact their neighboring cells to form desmosomes at the apicolateral regions, contain numerous mitochondria, and develop an endoplasmic reticulum. The outer stromal layer comprises a mixture of heterologous cells, including steroidogenic cells and cells of the vasculature. This organization was observed irrespective of the genetic sex of the morphants. These results demonstrate that gonadal somatic cells can intrinsically form this structure irrespective of their genetic sex in the absence of germ cells.The tube-like gonad and the sex-reversal phenotype of our cxcr4 morphants raised the possibility that the production of sex steroids is severely impaired in the gonads of these germ-cell-deficient animals. Both female and male secondary sex characteristics develop via the activity of sex steroid hormones secreted from the gonads, estradiol-17β and 11-ketotestosterone, respectively. In the ovary, the theca cells produce testosterone via steroidogenic enzymes such as P450c17, which is immediately converted into estradiol-17β in the granulosa cells by the action of aromatase (36–39). In the testis, Leydig cells produce 11-ketotestosterone from testosterone by the action of two enzymes, 11β-hydroxydehydrogenase 2 (11β-HSD2) and P45011β. The administration of 11-ketotestosterone has been shown to cause phenotypic female-to-male sex reversal in the medaka (40).To examine whether the production of sex steroids was altered in the cxcr4 morphants, we isolated the gonads from both normal and morphant adult fish and measured the levels of sex steroid hormones by enzyme immunoassays. We found that germ-cell-deficient XX morphant gonads contained 11-ketotestosterone at 2.3-fold greater levels than wild-type ovaries (Table 1) and at ≈50% of the amounts present in wild-type testes. This steroid was also detected in other tissues, such as the head kidney-containing interrenal cells (the adrenal equivalent in fish) and liver, at equivalent levels in XX morphants and wild-type males. This may suggest that 11-ketotestosterone is produced in the gonads and circulates with serum. Estradiol-17β, which is an abundant steroid in normal ovaries, was found to be below the detection threshold in XX morphant gonads.Measurement of sex steroid hormone contents in wild-type and cxcr4-morphant adult medaka (picogram per organ, mean ± SEM)These endocrinological profiles demonstrate that the emergence of male secondary sex characteristics in the XX morphants results from the increased production of 11-ketotestosterone and reduced levels of estradiol-17β.The alteration in the sex steroid profiles of the cxcr4 morphants suggests there is aberrant expression of steroidogenic enzymes in corresponding gonads. To test this possibility, we examined the gene expression patterns of steroidogenic enzymes by both RT-PCR and in situ hybridization in adult germ-cell-deficient medaka gonads. As expected, aromatase was undetectable in both the XX and XY morphant gonads, whereas the P45011β and 11βHSD2 transcripts necessary for the production of 11-ketotestosterone were detectable (Fig. 3 A). In addition, P450c17, which is essential for the production of the precursor steroids for estrogen and androgen, was found to be expressed in the germ-cell-deficient gonads of both sexes.Gene expression analysis of germ-cell-deficient gonads in the adult medaka.

Nuclei are counterstained with neutral red. Insets show the whole section in each case. (Scale bars, 20 μm.)In the medaka normal testis, P450c17, P45011β, and 11βHSD2 transcripts are expressed in the Leydig cells of the stromal regions (SI Fig. 6 A–C ). In situ hybridization analysis showed these transcripts could also be detected in an outer region of the germ-cell-deficient XX morphant gonads (Fig. 3 B and C and data not shown), but there was no detectable expression of aromatase (data not shown), consistent with the earlier RT-PCR data. In the normal ovary, the expression levels of P45011β and 11βHSD2 are so low that these transcripts cannot be detected by in situ hybridization (data not shown). These results are consistent with the fact that the androgen, 11-ketotestosterone, is produced in the germ-cell-deficient gonads of both sexes.Our initial results indicated that steroidogenic cells are masculinized in germ-cell-deficient medaka gonads regardless of the genetic sex. We thus examined whether the gene expression profile of the supporting cell lineages is also affected in these adult morphants. In the normal medaka testis, the male supporting cells, known as Sertoli cells, express DMRT1, amh, and sox9b (Fig. 1, SI Fig. 6 D–F , and data not shown). In the medaka ovary, however, the female supporting cells, the granulosa cells, express amh and foxl2 (27, 41). A weak DMRT1 signal in the wild-type ovary is detectable in small oocytes only by in situ hybridization (data not shown) (42). By RT-PCR analysis, we found that in both the XX and XY cxcr4 morphant gonads, the Sertoli cell markers, DMRT1 and sox9b, were highly expressed, whereas the granulosa cell marker foxl2 was undetectable (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, amh was also found to be undetectable in either the XX or XY morphant gonads (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that a reciprocal cross-talk between the germ cells and gonadal somatic cells is required for expression of this gene in both sexes (43). In addition, the medaka orthologue of mammalian Ad4BP/SF1, ftz-f1, which is expressed in the steroidogenic cells and supporting cells of both sexes (SI Fig. 6 G and H ), was also detectable in both the wild-type and morphant gonads (Fig. 3 A).By in situ hybridization analysis, we found that DMRT1 is strongly expressed in the innermost cells (Fig. 3 D), and that ftz-f1 was detectable in both the innermost cells and in some of the cell populations in the outer stromal region (Fig. 3 E). In contrast, the expression of sox9b, amh, and foxl2 was barely detectable by in situ hybridization (data not shown). This expression profile was observed in both the XX and XY morphant gonads, suggesting that, although the supporting cells may not be fully differentiated, their lineages are present and have acquired more masculinized characteristics.To investigate cell lineage differentiation at the earlier stages of gonadal development (10–20 dph) in germ-cell-deficient medaka, in situ hybridization was performed by using the developing gonads of the XX morphants. In the medaka, ftz-f1 and sox9b are established markers of the gonadal somatic cell precursors in undifferentiated gonads (23). Both ftz-f1 and sox9b were found in our current experiments to be expressed in the germ-cell-deficient gonads of the XX morphants at 10 dph (Fig. 4 D and E), indicating that the gonadal somatic cell precursors can form normally in the absence of germ cells. At a later stage, ftz-f1 expression was observed to be confined mainly to both the steroidogenic and granulosa cells, as reported in mammals (44), whereas sox9b becomes preferentially detectable in the Sertoli cells (32, 33). In normal female gonads at 10 dph, sox9b expression can be observed in the somatic cells surrounding relatively small oocytes, suggesting these sox9b-expressing cells have not fully differentiated into granulosa cells at this stage (Fig. 4 B) (25).Gene expression analysis of both wild-type and germ-cell-deficient developing gonads. The XX gonads of 10 dph wild-type (A–C and G–I), 10 dph morphant (D–F and J–L), and 20 dph morphant (M–O) were analyzed by in situ hybridization for the marker genes, which are indicated on the top of columns. Nuclei are counterstained with neutral red. The gonad in each image is enclosed by a black dotted line. Nephric duct (nd), gut (g). (Scale bars, 20 μm.)In the wild-type XX medaka gonads, foxl2 expression is detectable in the granulosa cells around the oocytes (Fig. 4 G), and aromatase is expressed near the ventral regions (Fig. 4 H). In germ-cell-deficient XX gonads, however, foxl2 is only weakly expressed in the interstitial region (Fig. 4 J) and then diminishes by 20 dph (Fig. 4 M). Aromatase is detected in the ventral region of germ-cell-deficient XX gonads at 10 dph (Fig. 4 K). However, this expression also diminishes at 20 dph (Fig. 4 N). The eventual loss of aromatase and foxl2 expression is thus consistent with the results of our RT-PCR analysis of adult morphant gonads. These results indicate that the germ cells are required for the maintenance of both aromatase and foxl2 expression.Androgen-producing cells were detectable by monitoring the expression of P450c17 at 10 dph in both wild-type and germ-cell-deficient XX gonads (Fig. 4 C and F). These cells persist into adulthood (Fig. 3 A and B). The Sertoli cell marker, DMRT1, also begins to be expressed at 10–20 dph in the XX morphant gonads (Fig. 4 L and O). The loss of foxl2 expression and concomitant induction of DMRT1 expression in the developing gonads of germ-cell-deficient XX morphants thus suggest that the female supporting cell lineage has been transdifferentiated into a male cell lineage. Alternatively, male supporting cells could newly develop in these tissues during the early stages of gonadal development before the initiation of gonadal morphogenesis.The results of our current study show that germ-cell-deficient XX medaka morphants manifest a female-to-male sex reversal of their secondary sex characteristics, which are induced by androgen and estrogen, respectively. The sex reversal phenotype of our XX morphants is therefore consistent with the increasing amounts of 11-ketotestosterone and reduced levels of estradiol-17β that we measured in their gonads. Female-specific estrogen-secreting cells were impaired in the XX morphant gonads.In addition to the loss of female-specific steroidogenic cells that we observe in our morphants, we find that the germ-cell-deficient gonads are partly masculinized in terms of their gene expression profile, although the number of genes examined was small. Significantly, this event occurs in the absence of germ cells and thus in a cell-autonomous manner in the soma. In this regard, our present results suggest that the gonadal somatic cells are predisposed to male development in the medaka.In contrast to mammals, the ovaries in teleost fish contain not only developing follicles but also cyst-forming mitotic and gonia-like germ cells (30, 45, 46). A previously reported sex-reversal experiment in the medaka suggested that the gonia-like germ cells are sexually indifferent, and that the branching point toward either sex occurs either before or somewhere during the process of meiosis (47). This finding raises the possibility that a functional sex-reversal event could arise in fertile XX morphant gonads with a small number of undifferentiated gonia-like germ cells that are under the influence of the gonadal somatic cells with a masculine predisposition. This may also be related to the sex differentiation of zebrafish, known as “juvenile hermaphroditism,” in which all of the individuals initially develop ovaries, but the oocytes are lost in the presumptive male gonads by apoptotic cell death, leading to testicular development (48). In mammals also, the loss of oocytes induces the transdifferentiation of granulosa cells into Sertoli-like cells (15), indicating that normal ovarian development requires the presence of developing oocytes. These phenomena support our contention that somatic cells are predisposed to developing male characteristics, but that the presence of oocytes canalizes them into female development pathways.To generate germ-cell-deficient medaka, the migration of primordial germ cells was blocked by the inhibition of the cxcr4 gene by morpholino injection (34). The effects of morpholinos generally persist for 3 days at most after injection into fertilized eggs. Given that the onset of gonadal formation initiates at 3–4 dpf in the medaka, and that ovarian cavity formation initiates at ≈30 dph, it is thus highly unlikely that the development of male somatic cells and the tube-like structure is due to the secondary effects of the injected cxcr4-MO.In support of this contention, we have also generated germ-cell-deficient medaka via a morpholino knockdown of medaka nanos, a gene that is essential for the maintenance of germ cell identity (49). These nanos morphants also exhibited sex reversal of their secondary sex characteristics and a tube-like structure of the gonad (SI Fig. 7). These findings are also consistent with a previous study in zebrafish showing that a germ cell deficiency generated by the inhibition of deadend, a gene involved in primordial germ cell development, causes sex reversal (22).Ovaries and testes are composed of structurally similar units (fundamental units) that comprise a layer of supporting cells surrounding the germ cell(s), which is separated from the outer stromal region by a basement membrane. This structure is evident in ovarian follicles and testicular tubules in the normal ovary and testis, respectively. In contrast to previous reports (8, 11, 19–21, 50), however, we show in our current study that medaka gonads with impaired cell lineages resulting from the forced absence of germ cells develop a single tube-like structure comprising this fundamental unit in terms of both histology and gene expression. Moreover, we find that this occurs irrespective of the genetic sex. Our findings thus indicate that gonadal somatic cells can form this fundamental unit without the function of the germ cells, whereas germ cells play an essential role in the generation of sexual dimorphism, possibly by organizing this unit in a sex-specific manner.In conclusion, we have herein characterized some of the principal cellular mechanisms underlying sex reversal in the medaka model organism and have revealed the importance of germ cells in the process of sex differentiation in the gonads of this species. These findings thus provide insights into the properties of gonadal somatic cells and germ cells in vertebrates.PCR conditions and primer sets are published as SI Tables 2–4.The inbred medaka strain, cab, was used in these experiments. The microinjection and generation of medaka with fluorescent germ cells, and cxcr4 and nanos morphants, have been described (34). The absence of fluorescent germ cells in the gonads was confirmed between stages 35 and 38 by fluorescence microstereoscopy. Forty-four percent of the cxcr4-MO embryos and 50% of the nanos-MO embryos were identified as germ-cell-deficient. Germ cell deficiency was also confirmed by immunostaining. The discrimination of secondary sex characteristics has been described in ref. 51.Steroid hormones were extracted in a solution containing chloroform and methanol (2:1) and then assayed by using an 11-ketotestosterone or estradiol EIA Kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI).Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed as reported (23), after which the samples are carefully selected to confirm the complete absence of germ cells. Briefly, the samples showing gene expression signals were sectioned entirely from one end to the other and subjected to immunostaining with anti-medaka OLVAS (vasa homologue) antibodies. This procedure determined whether the samples contained germ cells, and only those lacking germ cells were selected for further histological analyses.Gonad specimens were fixed overnight at 4°C in 2% glutaraldehyde, followed by 2% OsO4 in cacodylate buffer. The tissue was then embedded in EPON812 (TAAB). Ultrathin sections were stained with a saturated solution of uranyl acetate. Imaging was performed with a JEM-1200EX electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan).We thank Drs. K. Naruse (National Institute for Basic Biology), A. Kanamori (Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan), and M.

However, a strictly monogamous pipefish Corythoichthys haematopterus exceptionally exhibits a reversed sex role. To understand why its sex role is reversed, we measured the adult sex ratio and the potential reproductive rate (PRR), two principal factors influencing the operational sex ratio (OSR), in a natural population of southern Japan. The adult sex ratio was biased towards females throughout the breeding season, but the PRR, which increased with water temperature, did not show sexual difference. We found that an alternative index of the OSR (Sf/Sm: sex ratio of ‘time in’) calculated from the monthly data was consistently biased towards females. The female-biased OSR associated with sex-role reversal has been reported in some polyandrous or promiscuous pipefish, but factors biasing the OSR differed between these pipefish and C. haematopterus. We concluded that the similar PRR between the sexes in C. haematopterus does not confer reproductive benefit of polygamous mating on either sex, resulting in strict monogamous mating, and its female-biased adult sex ratio promotes female–female competition for a mate, resulting in sex-role reversal.Sexual selection arises from differential reproductive success based on intrasexual competition and mate choice (Andersson 1994). The direction and intensity of sexual selection are principally determined by the operational sex ratio (OSR), defined as the ratio of males to females ready to mate in a population at a given moment (Emlen & Oring 1977), although other factors such as variance in mate quality and cost of breeding also have some effect on them (Clutton-Brock & Parker 1992; Owens & Thompson 1994; Johnstone et al. 1996; Kvarnemo & Ahnesjö 1996, 2002; Kokko & Monaghan 2001). The OSR is strongly influenced by sexual difference in the potential reproductive rate (PRR), the population mean value of the maximum rate of reproduction each individual achieves when not constrained by mate availability, while other natural limitations remain in operation (Berglund et al. 1989; Clutton-Brock & Vincent 1991; Clutton-Brock & Parker 1992; Kvarnemo & Ahnesjö 1996, 2002; Parker & Simmons 1996). In most animals, the PRR of females is lower than that of males owing to their higher energy and time expenditure in gamete production and parental care (Trivers 1972), and therefore the OSR becomes male-biased and intense male–male competition for mates is expected (i.e. conventional sex role). In some animals, however, it has been reported that females have a higher PRR than males and consequently females are predominant competitors for mates (i.e. sex-role reversal, Oring & Lank (1986) and Berglund et al. (1989)). Together with sex differences in PRR, the adult sex ratio (more exactly the qualified sex ratio, Ahnesjö et al. (2001)) is considered a major determinant of OSR (Berglund et al. 1989; Kraus 1989; Clutton-Brock & Parker 1992; Madsen & Shine 1993; Parker & Simmons 1996).There is a strong association between mating patterns and sexual selection (Andersson 1994). Because the opportunity for sexual selection increases with variance in the reproductive success between individuals, the intensity of sexual selection is generally stronger in polygamous than monogamous species. As a result, sexual dimorphism in size, weaponry or ornamentation and sexual dichromatism increase with the degree of polygamy (Andersson 1994). In pipefish and seahorses (Pisces: Syngnathidae) which are characterized by paternal care in the brood pouch or on the ventral surface (Herald 1959), a clear association between mating patterns and sex roles has been reported: polyandrous or promiscuous species exhibit sex-role reversal, whereas the sex role of monogamous species is conventional (Vincent et al. 1992; Wilson et al. 2003). In polygamous species (e.g. Syngnathus floridae, Syngnathus scovelli, Syngnathus typhle and Nerophis ophidion), females are predominant competitors for mates and possess secondary sexual traits such as larger body size, skin fold and coloration to attract males (Jones & Avise 2001; Berglund & Rosenqvist 2003). In monogamous species, on the contrary, aggressive behaviour is observed only in males and sexual traits are expressed only in males (Dawson 1977; Vincent 1994a). As predicted by theory, the OSR of polygamous species is biased towards females, whereas that of monogamous species is only slightly male-biased (Berglund & Rosenqvist 1993; Vincent 1994b; Vincent et al. 1994). An exception is the pipefish species Corythoichthys haematopterus, which reproduces monogamously but its sex role is reversed (Matsumoto & Yanagisawa 2001).Corythoichthys haematopterus is a tail-brooding pipefish (subfamily: Urophori, less than 15 cm total length (TL)) inhabiting shallow waters of the Indo-Pacific (Dawson 1977). Long-term field observation revealed that male and female C. haematopterus form a lifelong pair bond and repeat mating exclusively (Matsumoto & Yanagisawa 2001). There are many unpaired females searching for mates in a population due to the female-biased adult sex ratio and the strict monogamous mating pattern. Matsumoto & Yanagisawa (2001) suggested that the OSR of C. haematopterus is constantly biased towards females, but they never made a practical examination of the OSR.In this study, we estimated seasonal fluctuations in the OSR of C. haematopterus from the PRR of each sex and the adult sex ratio in a natural population of southern Japan. We explained the reason for a combination of sex-role reversal and monogamous mating pattern, taking into account factors biasing the OSR.This study was carried out using SCUBA at Morode Beach (33°00′ N, 132°30′ E) on the west coast of Shikoku Island, Japan, from April to August 2004. We set up a 125×20 m quadrat on the boulder area (depth 2–8 m). Prior to the beginning of the study, we collected all adult C. haematopterus (more than 90 mm TL) found in the quadrat using a hand net, and then measured TL and marked individually giving a hypodermic injection of red VIFE (Visible Implant Fluorescent Elastomer; Northwest Marine Technology, USA) at up to three out of ten fixed dorsal sites. Marked individuals were caged for a day to recover from the handling stress, and were released at the site of capture. Throughout the study period, every unmarked adult C. haematopterus found in the quadrat was captured, measured and marked individually. Among 135 adult fish (56 males and 79 females) marked in total, 8 individuals (5.9%, 3 males and 5 females) were never observed in the quadrat after releasing. This marking technique did not seem to affect the behaviour of fish and conspicuousness to predators. No license was required for catching, tagging and experimental use of this fish in Japan.We censused the quadrat daily for approximately 3 hours between 05.00 to 19.00 hours during the period from 30 April to 25 August in 2004. We marked the location of each marked fish on the map, and checked the presence or the absence of embryos in the male's brood pouch and their developmental stage. We identified pair members by observing their ‘greeting’ behaviour and/or copulation.The PRR is expressed as the inverse of ‘time out’ (G) defined as the time when an individual is incapable of mating (Clutton-Brock & Parker 1992; Parker & Simmons 1996). Activities during time out include gamete production, courtship, parental care and so on (Clutton-Brock & Parker 1992; Parker & Simmons 1996). In the present study, the PRR=1/G because the unit of one clutch (or brood) was used. Because male C. haematopterus receive only one clutch from a female and females give all matured eggs in their ovary to a male in one spawning event, it is justified to use a clutch, instead of the exact number of eggs, as the unit of PRR.To calculate the male PRR, we defined male time out (Gm) as the period of brooding, i.e. days from spawning to hatching of the brood because males were capable of mating in the first morning after hatching of his previous brood at night (Matsumoto & Yanagisawa 2001; Sogabe et al. 2007). We calculated the brooding period for 30 males from the census data (30 April–24 August), and then converted it into the male PRR. We defined female time out (Gf) as the period required to prepare mature eggs. Because it is impossible to discern the completion of egg maturation under the natural condition, we used an experimental approach to estimate female time out as follows.We carried out the experiment in 18 females from 21 May to 25 August. Every early morning, paired C. haematopterus engaged in ritualized intra-pair interactions called greetings (Sogabe & Yanagisawa 2007). Their behavioural repertoire in the greeting changed on the day of spawning, and therefore we were able to identify a pair likely to spawn. After finding a focal pair, we observed their greeting and courtship until the pair members mutually exhibited the tail-end courtship behaviour called Position (Gronell 1984). At this stage of courtship, we captured the female, which had already completed egg hydration (A. Sogabe 2003, personal observation), and isolated her in a plastic cage (16×27×20 cm) for a day. On the next morning, we checked that the female had released hydrated eggs in the cage, and then released her at the greeting site. In all cases, the female resumed greetings with her mate. Subsequently, we monitored the pair once a day and recorded the day of first spawning after the manipulation. In the preliminary observation of ovaries of three females after releasing hydrated eggs, we confirmed that their ovaries contained only eggs of early immature stages. We expected the experimental female to provide a new clutch as fast as possible for the male whose brood pouch was empty. We regarded the interval from releasing hydrated eggs to spawning as Gf. In all cases, the female produced a clutch of normal size.To detect the influence of water temperature on PRR, we used the mean of daily water temperatures during time out. Body size was not significantly different between males and females used for the estimation of PRR (mean±s.d.: male: 126.9±10.3 mm, n=30; female: 127.0±12.0 mm, n=18; unpaired t-test: t=0.03, p=0.97). For the analysis, we used each male and female only once to avoid pseudoreplication.To estimate the monthly OSR, we adopted an approach begun by Clutton-Brock & Parker (1992) and further developed by Parker & Simmons (1996). The OSR is equivalent to the population mean ratio of the time spent searching and waiting for mating (i.e. time in) in females (Sf) and males (Sm; Clutton-Brock & Parker 1992). If Sf>Sm, females are expected to have more time available for mating (i.e. the OSR is biased towards females) and therefore expected to be predominant competitors for mates, and vice versa (Parker & Simmons 1996). We followed the Parker & Simmons's (1996) model to estimate the monthly OSR (see also Okuda 1999):The monthly adult sex ratio was significantly biased towards females throughout the study period, except in May (table 1). All adult males brooded the eggs during the study period, whereas there were many nomadic unpaired females searching for mates. The disappearance rate of fish (the proportion of marked fish which had disappeared from the quadrat during the study period to all marked fish) did not differ between the sexes (48.9% for males and 57.7% for females, Χ2-test: Χ12=0.84, p=0.36).Time out (G) of both sexes fluctuated during the study period, ranging from 9 to 22 days in males and from 10 to 19 days in females, resulting in a broad range of PRR (male: 0.045–0.111 clutches per day, n=30; female: 0.053–0.100 clutches per day, n=18). Simple linear regression analyses revealed that water temperature during time out affected PRR (R2=0.92, n=48, p<0.0001), whereas the body size of fish had no effect on PRR (R2=0.02, n=48, p=0.31). The slopes of the regressions of PRR on temperature during time out did not differ among the sexes (male: y=0.008x–0.123; female: y=0.008x–0.109; ANCOVA: sex×temperature, F1,44=0.67, p=0.42; figure 1). This interaction term was then removed from the ANCOVA, revealing a significant effect of temperature, but not of sex (temperature: F1,45=534.60, p<0.0001; sex: F1,45=2.01, p=0.16).Figure 1 PRR of female and male C. haematopterus in relation to water temperature during ‘time out’. Filled circles, females; open triangles, males. Lines (solid, female; dashed, male) denote linear regressions fitted to data.We calculated the monthly Sf/Sm using the monthly adult sex ratio (table 1) and the monthly mean G of each sex (male: May 18.38, n=8; June 13.25, n=8; July 11.00, n=9; August 9.80, n=5; female: May 18.50, n=4; June 13.13, n=8; July 11.00, n=3; August 10.33, n=3) and T (May 18.88, n=8; June 13.50, n=8; July 11.22, n=9; August 10.00, n=5). The Sf/Sm was consistently female-biased (figure 2).Figure 2 Population mean ratio of ‘time in’ for females to males (Sf/Sm) in C. haematopterus. Values were logarithmically transformed. A positive number indicates a female bias in the ratio.This study showed that the OSR of C. haematopterus is biased towards females throughout the breeding season. The OSR is a principal factor influencing the direction and intensity of competition for mates and hence of sexual selection (Emlen & Oring 1977; Clutton-Brock & Parker 1992; Reynolds 1996; Kvarnemo & Ahnesjö 2002). Our results were consistent with the previous report that female C. haematopterus are more active in searching for mates and in courtship displays than males (Matsumoto & Yanagisawa 2001).Sex-role reversal associated with the female-biased OSR shown in C. haematopterus has also been reported in two other pipefish, N. ophidion and S. typhle (Berglund & Rosenqvist 1993, 2003; Vincent et al. 1994). In C. haematopterus, the female-biased OSR was not due to the sexual difference in PRR but due to a bias in the adult sex ratio. By contrast, in N. ophidion and S. typhle, the primary factor biasing the OSR towards females is the sexual difference in PRR (Berglund et al. 1989; Ahnesjö 1995; Vincent et al. 1995). Females of N. ophidion and S. typhle, which mature their eggs continuously in their ovaries, can produce more eggs than those received by males during a certain time period (Berglund et al. 1989; Vincent et al. 1994). Accordingly, females of these species can obtain higher reproductive success by searching for a new mate rather than by waiting for the completion of brooding by the current mate and remating with him (Berglund et al. 1988, 1989; Rosenqvist 1990). Such a situation will naturally lead to polygamous mating.Although both these polygamous pipefish and C. haematopterus exhibit reversed sex roles, female members participating in mating competition differ between them. In the polygamous pipefish, all adult females are potential competitors for acquiring multiple mates. In C. haematopterus, in contrast, paired females do not participate in mating competition; only unpaired females are active in acquiring a mate, although they succeed in securing a paired status only after the disappearance of a paired female (Matsumoto & Yanagisawa 2001). Indeed, in our population, only unpaired females participated in courtship and aggressive behaviours (details in the electronic supplementary material, table S1). In addition, unpaired females had larger home ranges and moved longer distances per unit time than paired males and females, whereas no substantial differences were detected in these activities between paired males and females (details in the electronic supplementary material, figure S1). These facts suggest that sex-role reversal in C. haematopterus is caused by mating competition among nomadic unpaired females.Sex-role reversal associated with strict monogamy was found first in C. haematopterus (Matsumoto & Yanagisawa 2001) and recently reported in two seahorses, Hippocampus abdominalis and Hippocampus subelongatus (Kvarnemo et al. 2007; Wilson & Martin-Smith 2007). Why do these syngnathid fish reproduce monogamously despite the reversed sex role? In C. haematopterus which shows no sexual differences in PRR, females will gain little reproductive benefit by changing mates. Moreover, the female-biased adult sex ratio will give females few opportunities to find a new mate. Therefore, females are expected to have a better reproductive success by securing one mate and mating repeatedly with him (Matsumoto & Yanagisawa 2001). Male C. haematopterus also seem to gain little reproductive benefit by changing mates. In a field study where female C. haematopterus were removed from mating pairs, reproductive efficiency of their partners decreased due to the time required for a new mate to prepare mature eggs (Sogabe et al. 2007). A decrease in male reproductive efficiency following the mate switching is also reported in H. subelongatus (Kvarnemo et al. 2000).A puzzling problem pertaining to C. haematopterus is that the adult sex ratio is always female-biased (Matsumoto & Yanagisawa 2001; Sogabe et al. 2007). In general, such a biased ratio can arise from a differential mortality between the sexes and/or a bias in the primary sex ratio (Clutton-Brock & Parker 1992). It is unlikely that the female-biased adult sex ratio in our population is caused by a higher mortality rate of adult males because the disappearance rate of adults did not differ between the sexes (see also Matsumoto & Yanagisawa 2001). It will be worthwhile to examine whether the sex ratio of C. haematopterus is female-biased at birth and, if not, at which developmental stages the sex ratio becomes biased. It is of interest that the adult sex ratio of other sex-role reversed monogamous syngnathids, H. abdominalis and H. subelongatus, is also biased towards females (Kvarnemo et al. 2007; Wilson & Martin-Smith 2007).The sexual difference in PRR is an important factor determining the strength of sexual selection and hence the mating patterns (Kirby et al. 2006; Mobley & Jones 2007; Wilson & Martin-Smith 2007). The dependence of male PRR on ambient temperature has been reported in many ectotherms with paternal care (Kraus 1989; Kvarnemo 1994; Ahnesjö 1995). In syngnathids in which males care for embryos in their brood pouch, the developmental speed of embryos is under the control of temperature, and therefore the male PRR depends heavily on it. In contrast, the speed of egg production and maturation by females usually depends more on food intake than on ambient temperature (Wootton 1979; Kvarnemo 1997). Social factors such as the presence of dominant neighbouring females may also affect the speed of egg production and maturation (Ahnesjö 1995).In C. haematopterus, the PRR increased with temperature but exhibited no sexual difference at any temperature (figure 1). The unbiased PRR between the sexes, which provides a low potential for multiple mating in either sex, can be a major causal factor for the evolution of monogamy. However, one may argue that the sexually similar PRR observed in C. haematopterus is not a cause of monogamy but a secondary adaptation to monogamy. Although it is premature to derive a conclusion, we infer that the sexual difference in PRR provides a basic framework for the evolution of polygamy or monogamy. Once monogamy has evolved, however, females may fine-tune their speed of egg production and maturation to the developmental speed of embryos cared by their mates to promote reproductive efficiencies of the monogamous pair. If this is true, the monogamous mating system of C. haematopterus may be more resistant to environmental fluctuations than we expect.We thank G.

Learn about our remote access optionsSexual selection theory predicts a positive correlation between relative parental investment and mate choice. In syngnathid fishes (seahorses and pipefish), males brood offspring in specialized brooding structures. While female‐female mating competition has been demonstrated in some pipefishes, all seahorses (genus Hippocampus) studied to date have been found to have conventional sex roles with greater male–male competition for access to mates despite possessing the most complex brood structures in the family. Although multiple mating is common in pipefish, seahorses are again exceptional, exhibiting strict genetic monogamy. Both demographic and behavioural explanations have been offered to explain the lack of multiple mating in seahorse species, but these hypotheses have not yet been explicitly addressed. We investigated mating systems and brood parentage of the pot‐bellied seahorse, Hippocampus abdominalis, a temperate‐water species that is socially promiscuous with conventional sex roles in laboratory populations. We observed promiscuous courtship behaviour and sex‐role reversal in high density, female‐biased field populations of H. abdominalis. We hypothesize that sex roles are plastic in H. abdominalis, depending on local population density and sex ratio. Despite promiscuous courtship behaviour, all assayed male seahorses were genetically monogamous in both laboratory and wild populations. Physiological limitations associated with embryo incubation may explain the absence of multiple mating in seahorses and may have played an important role in the development of the unique reproductive behaviour typical in these species.Volume16, Issue11June 2007Pages 2345-2352Advanced SearchEdited by Anne McLaren, Gurdon Institute of Cancer and Developmental Biology, Cambridge, United Kingdom, and accepted by the Editorial Board April 16, 2007 (received for review December 20, 2006)We previously performed mutant screens in the medaka for defects in gonadal development and identified a mutant of interest in this regard, which was designated as hotei (hot). This mutant manifests a number of remarkable phenotypic abnormalities including: (i) excessive proliferation of germ cells that initiates at around the hatching stage regardless of the genetic sex of the fish; (ii) initiation of premature meiosis in phenotypically male hot homozygotes; (iii) one-half of the hot-homozygous XY fish undergo sex reversal, which accompanies the expression of the female-characteristic aromatase gene in the somatic cells of the gonad; and (iv) in phenotypically female homozygotes, follicular development is arrested at an early stage. We have also performed genetic mapping, chromosome walking, and candidate gene sequencing analysis of hot and demonstrate that the underlying mutation occurs in the recently identified medaka anti-Müllerian hormone (Amh) receptor type II (amhrII) gene. Moreover, this gene was found to be responsible for each of the hot phenotypes, as an amhrII transgene rescues these abnormalities. In addition, the amhrII gene is expressed in the somatic cells of the gonads of both sexes. The phenotypes of the hot homozygotes indicate that there are multiple regulatory functions of the AMH/AMHRII signaling system in the development of the gonad, including the sex-dependent regulation of germ cell proliferation and follicular development. These presumably represent the basic roles of Amh, which precede Müllerian duct evolution during phylogeny.Medaka, Oryzias latipes, is a small freshwater fish native to Japan and eastern Asia and has been cultivated in recent years as a genetically refined laboratory animal and model organism (1). An advantage of using the medaka in sexual differentiation studies is that the sex of this organism is primarily determined genetically, by the XX/XY chromosome system (2), which is analogous to mammals. In addition, the DMY/dmrt1bY gene on the Y chromosome of this fish species has been identified as the male-determining gene (3, 4), which further facilitates the investigation of gonadal and germ cell development in conjunction with sex differentiation. In both medaka and mammals, germ cells develop through various stages of mihotic proliferation and by entry into meiosis, reductive division, and also entry into a quiescent state awaiting specific fertilization signals that have different timings, depending on the sex. In females, germ cells begin to proliferate at around the hatching stage, and soon enter into meiosis and develop as oocytes. In males, germ cells remain in mihotic arrest for 2 weeks and initiate meiosis only 4 weeks after hatching. The sex of a normal medaka of a few weeks old can thus be judged by the abundance of germ cells in its gonads (5, 6).In the developing gonad, multiple interactions occur between germ cells and somatic cells. Recent studies have also identified several genes that are essential for mammalian early gonadal development (7, 8). Anti-Müllerian hormone (Amh), also known as Müllerian inhibiting substance/factor (Mis/Mif), is one such gene and is a secreted intercellular signaling protein belonging to the TGF-β superfamily. Amh expression is restricted to the Sertoli cells in the testis and granulosa cells in the ovary (9–13). In amniotes, a hallmark function of Amh is to induce regression of the Müllerian ducts. Amh functions primarily through the anti-Müllerian hormone receptor type II (AmhrII) (14), a member of the type II receptors for the TGF-β -related protein family that possesses a single transmembrane domain and a serine/threonine kinase domain and functions in conjunction with a type I receptor of TGF-β superfamily (15–17). Bmpr1a (Alk3) has been shown to function as an AMH type I receptor (16). Interestingly, however, Amh is also expressed in lower vertebrates lacking a Müllerian duct (18–20), suggesting that there are evolutionally conserved functions of the Amh/Amhr signaling network, such as ovarian folliculogenesis and gonadal steroidogenesis.Aromatase is an enzyme that is expressed in the follicular layer surrounding the oocytes in the ovary and catalyzes the conversion of androgen to estrogen (21). Although estrogen has been suggested to contribute to sexual differentiation of the gonads in lower vertebrates, the actual roles of aromatase and Amh in this process have not been fully clarified. The inhibition of the estrogen action results in the development of testicular structures that express amh (22), whereas Amh inhibits the aromatase-dependent estrogenic activity that is present in cultured fetal gonads (23, 24), suggesting that a reciprocal interaction occurs between these two pathways.Recently, the medaka amhrII gene was identified, which represents the first characterization of this receptor in nonmammalian vertebrates (25). In fish, Wolffian duct is associated with the pronephros regardless of the sex, and sperm duct and oviduct are derived from the coelomic epithelium (26) analogous to amniote Müllerian duct. In medaka, amh and amhrII are expressed in somatic cells of the developing gonads identically between the sexes during larval and juvenile stages. These results suggest that the medaka amh and amhrII genes are involved in gonadal development including the regulation of germ cells in both sexes.To further elucidate the genes involved in gonadal development, we performed a screen of medaka mutants displaying abnormal gonad development (27, 28). As a result of this analysis, we successfully identified a number of mutants showing gonadal defects (27), among which a mutant of particular interest was hotei (hot), causing excessive germ cell proliferation and male-to-female sex reversal. Here, we show that the hot mutation resides in the amhrII gene and thus reveal important functions of Amh signaling that have not been characterized in amniotes.The hot mutation, which causes gonadal hypertrophy, behaves in an autosomal recessive manner [supporting information (SI) Fig. 7 and SI Table 2]. In wild-type fish, XX females and XY males are distinguishable by the shapes of their dorsal and anal fins (Fig. 1 A and B). Adult XX hot-homozygotes (hot/hot) show an enlarged abdomen (Fig. 1 E). Adult XY hot-homozygous fish can be classified into two groups (Table 1), one-half of which have female characteristics (Fig. 1 C) with an enlarged abdomen (as shown in Fig. 1 E), and the remaining half of which show a male fin phenotype (Fig. 1 D) with an abdominal enlargement (Fig. 1 F), although this is less pronounced when compared with mutants of phenotypic females. The abdomens of the female hot homozygotes of either the XX or XY genotypes were occupied with hypertrophic ovaries (Fig. 1 I) that had pushed the other internal organs against the abdominal wall. The hot homozygotes of XY males also display hypertrophic testis (Fig. 1 J).Adult hot-homozygous mutant phenotypes.

Filled diamond, wild-type XX; open square, wild-type XY; filled circle, ovary-containing hot homozygotes of either XX or XY; open circle, XY hot homozygotes with testes.Phenotypes of the hot homozygous fish at 6 months after hatchingAt 3 months after hatching, wild-type medaka are sexually mature, and their gonads reach a maximum size. In contrast, the gonads of hot mutants were found to continue growing at 5 months after hatching (Fig. 1 K and L). Although most of the hot-homozygous mutants are sterile, a few female mutant fish were found to be fertile until 5 months of age, which contrasts with wild-type fish that show fertility for 1 year. Phenotypically, male hot-homozygous fish produced sperm, although the fertility of these fish is low. A fraction of the heterozygous males were also found to develop enlarged testis past 6 months after hatching. Very few of the hot homozygotes survive past one year, compared with the normal life span of around two years for wild-type medaka.Wild-type mature ovaries during the spawning period of the medaka contain follicles at various developmental stages, from previtellogenic to fully grown (Fig. 2 A and A′). In contrast to wild-type, the hypertrophic ovaries of XX and XY female hot homozygotes are filled with small follicles (Fig. 2 B and B′). Thus, in hot homozygotes the germ cells continue to increase, whereas follicular development is arrested during early vitellogenesis, and these features can be observed even at 6 months after hatching. In wild-type testes, spermatogonia are located in the most peripheral regions of the lobule structures, and spermatogenesis proceeds synchronously within the cysts in these lobules (Fig. 2 C and C′). In the male-type XY hot mutants, hypertrophic testes develop that are filled with germ cells and sperm at various developmental stages (Fig. 2 D and D′). In a minor fraction of XY hot homozygotes, the gonads contained both testicular and ovarian components (see Fig. 6 E).Histological sections of gonads from wild-type and hot-homozygous fish at 6 months after hatching. The specimens are sections of the tissues shown in Fig. 1 K stained with hematoxylin-eosin. (A) Wild-type ovary. (B) XX hot-homozygous ovary.

[Scale bars, 0.5 mm (A–D); 0.1 mm (A′–D′).]In hot homozygotes, the germ cells had already increased their number at 20 days post hatching (dph), analogous to normal ovary, and regardless of ovarian or testicular development, hypertrophy of the gonad occur during the posthatching period. The increasing number of germ cells is illustrated by Fig. 3 A–E, which show gonads of hot-homozygous larvae at 20 dph that contain more abundant germ cells compared with wild type, regardless of the XX or XY genotypes. Even in the XY hot fish, the germ cells within the gonads rapidly increase their number and start meiosis by 20 dph regardless of the sex of the organs (Fig. 3 D and E). This contrasts markedly with wild-type testis, where meiosis does not commence until ≈4 weeks after hatching. Furthermore, in the wild-type medaka, the germ cells are maintained in a thin layer in the gonads (Fig. 3 A and B). In contrast, the gonads of both XX and XY hot homozygotes were expanded in all dimensions, with more abundant and disorganized germ cells.Histology of wild-type and hot-homozygous mutant larvae.

Hematoxylin-eosin staining is shown in A–D, and neutral red staining is shown in E.We performed positional cloning to characterize the specific gene that is mutated in the hot strains of medaka. This mutation was mapped to linkage group 7, based on its cosegregation with the Cab-line (southern strain)-associated polymorphic markers against Kaga (northern strain), within the 4 cM interval flanked by the EST markers Ola0109b and Olb2507h (Fig. 4 A). Chromosomal walking was carried out by using these markers, and the position of the hot mutation was narrowed down to scaffold 3 [Medaka Whole-Genome Shotgun (WGS) sequencing project (http://medaka.utgenome.org), version 1.0]. Possible candidate genes for the hot mutation on this scaffold were then examined by sequencing, and this subsequently identified an A-to-G mutation in exon 9 of the recently identified amhrII gene (25) (Fig. 4 B and C). Cloning of the full-length amhrII cDNA confirmed that this gene consists of 11 exons and encodes a 492-aa-long Ser/Thr receptor kinase (Fig. 4 C). The hot mutation causes a Cys substitution at the Tyr residue at position 390 in the kinase domain, which is a highly conserved amino acid among the type II receptors (Fig. 4 D and E).Characterization of the hot mutation.

(F) Rescue of the hot-homozygous phenotype by expression of a wild-type amhrII transgene. The hyperproliferation of germ cells in the ovary was inhibited in the transgenic fish at 3 months of age. (Left) Wild-type ovary. (Center) hot/hot XX fish harboring the amhrII transgene. (Right) hot/hot XX fish. (Scale bar, 10 mm.) (F′) Sections of the ovaries shown in F. In the hot/hot XX fish carrying the amhrII transgene, the number of growing follicles is reduced compared with the hot-homozygous ovary, and postovulatory follicle is also observed (PO).To confirm that the Y390C mutation in exon 9 of the amhrII gene is responsible for the hot phenotypes, a 12-kb region derived from HNI (northern inbred line) genome (nucleotide positions 3172–3184 kb in scaffold 3; represented in Fig. 4 A as Tg) was used as a transgene and injected into fertilized eggs of hot heterozygous parents. Among the progeny of the F1 generation, two fish were identified as hot-homozygous females harboring this amhrII transgene. In both of these transgenic homozygotes, hypertrophy of the ovary was suppressed at 3 months after hatching (Fig. 4 F). The GSI (gonad weight/body weight percentage) was calculated as 2.3% and 5.0% in these transgenic fish, whereas it was measured as 25.6% (20.3–30.0%) and 3.3% (0.6–6.1%) in a hot-homozygous and wild-type female, respectively (Fig. 1 L). Furthermore, histological analysis indicated that the follicular development had been largely recovered in the transgenic fish (Fig. 4 F′). These data further confirm that hot corresponds to a mutation in the amhrII gene.To correlate the defect of AmhrII with the hot-homozygous phenotype, the tissue specificity of the expression of amhrII was investigated by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. In adult fish, amhrII was found to be specifically expressed in the ovary and testis (Fig. 5 A). In larvae, amhrII is also expressed in the gonads of both wild-type and hot homozygotes, regardless of their sex (Fig. 5 B). In situ hybridization further indicated that amhrII is expressed in the somatic cells around the germ cells (Fig. 5 C–E). In addition, the amh gene, which encodes the ligand for AmhrII, has been reported to be expressed in the cells around the germ cells of wild-type fish (25, 29), which is also true for hot homozygotes, regardless of their sex genotype (data not shown).Expression of amhrII in adult and developing larvae.

(C) Wild-type XX. (D) Wild-type XY. (E) XX hot/hot. (Scale bars, 0.1 mm.)Because a significant fraction of the hot-homozygous XY fish examined in our experiments show reversal of their secondary sex characteristics, the expression of the estrogen-synthesizing aromatase gene was examined in these animals. In wild-type larvae, aromatase is highly expressed in the female XX ovary (Fig. 6 A and A′), but not in XY male testis (Fig. 6 D) at 20 dph. In hot-homozygous larvae, the expression of aromatase is detectable in both XX and XY ovary-type gonads (Fig. 6 B and B′, and data not shown), whereas no signal can be observed in XY testis-type gonads by using whole mount specimens (Fig. 6 C) or cross sections (data not shown). In the XY hot, gonads of either female-type development or female/male mixed development, aromatase was expressed only in the somatic cells around the oocytes (Fig. 6 B and E).Expression of aromatase transcripts in both wild-type and homozygous hot medaka. Wild-type (A and D) and hot-homozygous (B, C, and E) larvae at 20 dph were hybridized with an aromatase probe. Aromatase signals are detectable in the wild-type ovary (A) and in the ovarian-type gonads of the hot-homozygous mutant (B). (A′ and B′) Shown are sections of the gonads in A and B, respectively, demonstrating expression of aromatase in the somatic cells near the ocytes (arrows) in both wild type (A′) and hot homozygotes (B′). Aromatase signals are not detected in the gonads of XY hot homozygotes with testicular development (C) or XY wild-type (D). In XY hot-homozygous gonads possessing both ovarian and testicular components (E), aromatase signals are detected only in the region of somatic cells that surround the oocytes (arrows). (F) RT-PCR analysis of aromatase in the gonads and vitellogenin in the liver in adult fish (6 months old). Both vitellogenin and aromatase are expressed in the phenotypically female fish (i.e., wild-type XX, XX hot-homozygotes, and XY hot-homozygotes, showing the development of ovaries), but not in phenotypically male fish. [Scale bars, 0.5 mm (A–C); 0.1 mm (A′–C′, D, and E).]vitellogenin gene was also found to be expressed in the liver of phenotypically female adult fish, even those with XY chromosomes (Fig. 6 F). Continuous incorporation of vitellogenin from the circulating serum results in the growth of large follicles in the normal ovary. However, in the adult hot-homozygous ovary, most follicles do not progress beyond the early stages of their development and do not accumulate vitellogenin, which indicates that the defects in Amh signaling cause multiple abnormalities associated with the functions of follicular cells in addition to the dysregulation of germ cell proliferation.hotei homozygous medaka mutants show remarkable phenotypes, including (i) excessive proliferation of germ cells that initiates soon after hatching regardless of the phenotypic sex of the fish; (ii) initiation of premature meiosis in phenotypically male hot homozygotes; (iii) sex reversal in 50% of the hot-homozygous XY fish, which accompanies the expression of aromatase in the somatic cells of the gonad; and (iv) growth arrest at an early stage of follicular development, despite vitellogenin expression in the liver. We also demonstrate in our current study that the hot mutation is a critical amino acid substitution (Y390C) in the amhrII gene, and that all of the phenotypes that arise in the corresponding mutant fish can be ascribed to the consequences of this defect on Amh/AmhrII signaling. Recessive Mendelian transmission of the mutation and the rescue of the mutant phenotype by the amhrII transgene suggest that the hot mutation caused loss of function of AmhrII.The germ cells in normal female gonads initiate successive proliferative events to produce cystic clusters at the time of hatching, which results in the abundance of germ cells in females. Some populations of these clusters subsequently enter meiosis (D.S. and M.T., unpublished data). By contrast, in the normal wild-type male medaka, such successive proliferation does not occur until 4 weeks after hatching. It is possible, therefore, that Amh/AmhrII signaling regulates these successive proliferations and consequently that mutation of the amhrII gene causes unrestrained proliferation in males with a similar timing to that of the females. In this context, the phenotypically female hot homozygotes also show uncontrolled proliferation of germ cells and large increases in the germ cell number.Of interest are the downstream effects of the disrupted Amh signaling in the hot homozygotes. The follicular cells in hot mutants express the gene for aromatase that catalyzes the synthesis of estrogen in the somatic cells around the developing oocytes, regardless of its genetic sex (Fig. 6). It had been demonstrated that estrogen promotes the hepatic synthesis of vitellogenin, and we subsequently confirmed vitellogenin expression in the liver of female hot homozygotes. In hot mutants, the growth of follicles is arrested, despite the occurrence of aromatase-dependent vitellogenin synthesis, suggesting that the vitellogenin uptake by the follicular cells (30) is affected.Although the “anti-Müllerian duct” effects of Amh have been primarily emphasized in higher vertebrates, this protein is a phylogenetically conserved signaling molecule and has been identified in many teleost fish species that lack a Müllerian duct (18–20, 25, 29). The phenotypes of the hot homozygotes indicate that there are conserved functions of Amh/AmhrII signaling that are distinct from its role in Müllerian duct regression. Indeed, Amh was initially reported as a spermatogenesis preventing substance (eSRS21), because it shows inhibitory activity toward the initiation of this process in cocultures of germ cells and somatic cells (18). A possibly related observation is that mammalian Amh also inhibits the proliferation of both Leydig cells (12, 13) and ovarian cancer cells (31). Amh has also been implicated in male sex differentiation, female follicular development, and also steroidogenesis in both sexes (9–13). In mammals, the lack of AMH signaling as manifested in Amh knockout mice and human patients causes precocious folliculogenesis (32, 33), in contrast to the defect of folliculogenesis in hot homozygotes described here. The mechanism underlying this difference is not clear at this point; however, the mouse model with the disrupted amhrII gene demonstrates male internal pseudohermaphroditism, having both male and female reproductive organs (34), again indicating analogy with the cases of hot-homozygous XY fish.Because one half of the XY hot homozygotes develop sperm in their gonads, Amh/AmhrII signaling may not be a component of the major sex differentiation pathways in medaka. It is also possible that, in the hot mutants, signals that are derived from the somatic cells under the control of DMY/dmrt1bY and that masculinize the germ cells are not transmitted efficiently to the proliferating germ cells. In the gonad of female-dominant mixed phenotype XY hot homozygotes, aromatase is expressed only in the region of gonadal somatic cells where germ cells undergo folliculogenesis (Fig. 6 E). The feminization of germ cells may then release the somatic cells from the repression of aromatase expression that is exerted by DMY/dmrt1bY. In zebrafish (35) and chicken (36), amh expression commences earlier than that of other genes, such as sox9, and its sexual dimorphic expression is not apparent during this early stage. Sexually dimorphic expression of the amh gene may therefore be a consequence of the sexual differentiation of the gonad that takes place first. How such species-dependent variations in the association of the Amh/AmhrII system with male development are coupled with sex-differentiation mechanisms is an interesting issue that is deserving of further study.In conclusion, the multifaceted gonad- and sex-associated phenotypes of the hotei medaka mutant have further elucidated the central functions of the Amh/AmhrII system during gonadal development. This also underscores the value of focused mutant screening in vertebrates and demonstrates the advantage of the medaka as a model system in genetic studies.The hotei mutation was induced in the Cab-Kyoto line (called “tot” in refs. 27 and 28). The Kaga-Kyoto line (28) was used for polymorphic marker-based genetic mapping.Genetic mapping and chromosome walking were performed essentially as described by Geisler (37), using restriction fragment length polymorphism markers [medaka linkage map database (ML Base), http://mbase.bioweb.ne.jp/∼dclust/ml_base.html] and markers designed based on information from the Tetraodon Genome Browser (www.genoscope.cns.fr/externe/tetranew) and Medaka University of Tokyo Genome Browser (http://medaka.utgenome.org) databases. To identify the mutation, genomic DNA was amplified by PCR, using primers designed from the information in the University of Tokyo Genome Browser. This database was also used to predict introns and exons. The central fragment of the amhrII cDNA was isolated by RT-PCR from adult testes, and full-length cDNA was obtained by 5′ RACE and 3′ RACE. Phylogenic distance was calculated by using BLAST Tree View Widget (National Center for Biotechnology Information).The genomic fragment containing the entire amhrII gene plus klhl 3′ UTR was excised from BAC clone Mn0073N15 derived from the HNI line, and placed in the pCRII–TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The klhl sequence in the hot mutants contained no mutation. Fertilized eggs of hot heterozygous parents were injected with the DNA (6) and reared (28). Three hot-homozygous and two heterozygous fish carried the HNI-derived amhrII transgene. These G0 fish were mated with hot heterozygotes, and two progeny fish identified as the transgene-carrying hot homozygotes were examined for the phenotype.RT-PCRwas performed by using the following primers: amhrII forward 5′-GTTGTGGGACAAGGACACTTTGCC-3′ and reverse 5′-CAGGATCTCAGGAGACATGTAGTGGG-3′; Aromatase forward 5′-CTGTGCTCATTGTTGCTTG-3′ and reverse 5′-CGTAAGACAAACTGCTCAGG-3′; Vitellogenin forward 5′-TCTGAGAGGTTCAACATCATACAG-3′ and reverse 5′-GCGTATCTCTGTACTTGCTCC-3′. The RT-PCR-derived sequences were also used as a probe for in situ hybridization (27, 38). The amhrII sequence, corresponding to to exons 6–9, is highly diversified from other TGFβ-family receptors (the closest being bmprII with 55% sequence identity), ruling out cross-hybridization with other type II receptor sequences.We thank the Kondoh Team members, in particular Y.

Bern, University of California, Berkeley, CA, January 3, 2007 (received for review June 20, 2006)Although the sex-determining gene SRY/Sry has been identified in mammals, homologues and genes that have a similar function have yet to be identified in nonmammalian vertebrates. Recently, DMY (the DM-domain gene on the Y chromosome) was cloned from the sex-determining region on the Y chromosome of the teleost fish medaka (Oryzias latipes). DMY has been shown to be required for the normal development of male individuals. In this study, we show that a 117-kb genomic DNA fragment that carries DMY is able to induce testis differentiation and subsequent male development in XX (genetically female) medaka. In addition, overexpression of DMY cDNA under the control of the CMV promoter also caused XX sex reversal. These results demonstrate that DMY is sufficient for male development in medaka and suggest that the functional difference between the X and Y chromosomes in medaka is a single gene. Our data indicate that DMY is an additional sex-determining gene in vertebrates.The sex of an individual is decided by the sex of the gonad, and in most cases the information required for a gonad to become either a testis or an ovary is encoded in the genome. The gene at the top of the sex-determination cascade for mammals is located on the Y chromosome and is called SRY. This gene was first identified during deletion analysis of the human Y chromosome (1). Furthermore, Sry, which is the mouse homologue of SRY, has been shown to be sufficient for the induction of male development in transgenic mice (2). In nonmammalian vertebrates, which also have a male heterogametic (XX-XY) sex-determining system, neither a homologue of Sry nor any other candidate genes recruited in sex determination was found until recently.Recently, we identified a single candidate gene at the top of the sex determination cascade in the teleost medaka, Oryzias latipes, by positional cloning in the sex-determining region of the Y chromosome, and we named this gene DMY (3), although it has also been designated as dmrt1bY (4). This sex-determining region originated from a duplication of an autosomal region and it spans 258 kb, carrying only the DMY gene (4, 5). The expression of DMY is restricted exclusively to the somatic cells that surround the germ cells in the XY gonads, and the gene contains the highly conserved DM domain, which was originally described as a DNA-binding motif that is shared by doublesex (dsx) in Drosophila melanogaster and mab-3 in Caenorhabditis elegans (6). The involvement of DMY in the process of sex determination was confirmed by the advent of two naturally occurring sex-reversed mutants, in which DMY was either truncated or expressed at reduced levels (3). Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether DMY is sufficient for the development of an individual into a male.In this study, we performed overexpression experiments using the DMY genomic region or DMY cDNA, which can induce testis development in genetic females (XX). We used the d-rR (7) and the Qurt (8) strains of medaka. In both strains, the genetic sex can be distinguished on the basis of body color. These experiments were designed to show that DMY is sufficient for male development and, consequently, that DMY is the sex-determining gene in medaka.We subcloned the DMYHNI genomic region, which encompasses ≈56 kb of the coding region, 60 kb of the upstream region, and 1.4 kb of the downstream region, from a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) genomic clone to the pCC1 vector (Fig. 1 A). The vector containing DMYHNI genomic DNA fragment (Fig. 1 A) was injected into one-cell-stage medaka embryos of the d-rR strain. The transgene (DMYHNI ) and the host gene (DMYd-rR ) were distinguished either by restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFPLs) of the genomic PCR products (Fig. 1 B) or by differences in the nucleotide sequences of the respective RT-PCR products (Fig. 1 C). The typical body coloration of the d-rR strain (white female and orange-red male) and the secondary sexual characteristics of the fins of medaka are shown in Fig. 2 A and C.Transgenic construct of the DMY genomic region. (A) Transgenic construct derived from the BAC clone mCON051H1, which contains DMYHNI and two SfiI sites. The red coloration of the BAC clone represents the insert. This fragment was digested with SfiI and ligated into the pCC1 vector by using linkers. (B) Genomic PCR products digested with StuI. The DMYd-rR allele is digested, whereas the DMYHNI allele is not digested. M represents the DNA marker. The arrowheads show the positions of the 1.5-kb and 1.0-kb DNA fragments. (C) Sequence chromatograms of the RT-PCR products of transgenic medaka. The DNA polymorphisms between DMYHNI and DMYd-rR are shown by arrowheads. Transgenic XX individuals have only the DMYHNI allele, whereas transgenic XY individuals have both the DMYHNI and DMYd-rR alleles.Phenotypic analyses of DMY transgenic adult medaka. (A–C) The external secondary sexual characteristics and body coloration of the DMY transgenic fish in the adult stage are shown. The secondary sexual characteristics are manifested in the size and shape of dorsal and anal fins (white arrowhead). Both dorsal and anal fins of males are larger then those of females. The transgenic medaka include: a white (XX) female (A), a white (XX) male (B), and an orange-red (XY) male (C). Body coloration is clearly discernable at the basal parts of the fins (white asterisks). Gonadal histologies of a transgenic XX medaka, which has an ovary (D), an XX medaka, which has testes (E and E′), and an XY medaka (F and F′). ED, efferent duct. (Scale bars: D, E′, and F′, 200 μm; E and F, 50 μm.)In the F0 generation, we obtained 57 orange-red (XY) and 58 white (XX) adult-stage transgenic fish (Table 1). Of the 58 white fish, 13 (22.4%) showed male secondary sex characteristics (Table 1, Fig. 2). Genomic PCR-RFLP analyses revealed that none of these fish carried the DMYd-rR allele, which confirmed that they were XX. Eight of these 13 white males were found to be fertile, and 3 were sterile (i.e., we could not obtain fertilized eggs) (Table 2). Because some of the fish died before or during the mating experiments, we could not check their fertility (categorized as “not assessed” in Table 2).Genotyping and phenotyping (secondary sexual characteristics) of transgenic fish using the DMY genomic regionAssessments of fertility of F0 transgenic fish using the DMY genomic regionTo confirm the mRNA expression of the DMYHNI transgene, we examined the integration and expression of the transgene in newly hatched transgenic fry by genomic PCR-RFLP, RT-PCR, and in situ hybridization with DMY as the probe. The genomes of 16 newly hatched transgenic fry were examined, and all were found by genomic PCR-RFLP to harbor the DMYHNI transgene. Of these 16 fish, 5 were XX and 11 were XY. The levels of mRNA expression in the all XX and 27% of XY fry were examined by using RT-PCR (Table 3). All of the XX and XY transgenic embryos examined showed expression of the transgene (DMYHNI ) in RT-PCR and direct sequencing experiments. The expression levels varied between individuals (data not shown). We examined an additional 21 newly hatched transgenic fry for DMYHNI expression by in situ hybridization (Table 3 and Fig. 3). The sexes of these fry were assessed by genomic PCR-RFLP. Because the in situ hybridization method cannot distinguish the DMYd-rR (recipient) and DMYHNI (transgene) alleles, we were unable to estimate transgene involvement in the signals obtained from the XY embryos. However, 26.7% of the XX transgenic embryos examined showed expression of the DMYHNI transgene. The signals were found in somatic cells that surrounded the germ cells (pre-Sertoli cells), which resembles the pattern of endogenous expression of DMY in normal XY embryos.Transgene expression in embryos on the day of hatching (0 DAH)Analyses of DMY transgenic medaka at different developmental stages. (A–C) DMY mRNA expression in the gonads of the fry is revealed by digoxigenin-labeled in situ hybridization of larval sections. (A) DMY-negative gonad of a transgenic XX fry. Strong signals for DMY are seen in the cells surrounding the germ cells in the XX fry (B) and XY fry (C). (A–C) Germ cells are denoted by asterisks. Gonad histologies at 2 DAH (D–F) and 30 DAH (G–I). (E and H) Transgenic XX medaka with testis-like gonads. (F and I) The transgenic XY individuals have gonads with typical testicular structure. The gonadal region is outlined by dotted lines. (Scale bars: 20 μm.)To elucidate sex reversal during the overexpression of DMY, we analyzed histologically the gonads of the d-rR fish at 20 and 30 days after hatching (DAH). Genetic sexing was performed on the basis of body color. We analyzed 24 (12 XX and 12 XY) and 32 (15 XX and 17 XY) individuals at 20 and 30 DAH, respectively. All of the XY medaka were found to be normal. For the XX medaka, 8.3% (20 DAH) and 6.3% (30 DAH) displayed the acinus structure (a globular structure that is the seminiferous tubule precursor), whereas the remaining medaka had ovaries. However, we found that some of the XX fish had slowly developing ovaries, with either low numbers of germ cells or with incomplete follicles (see Discussion).The first morphological sex difference manifested in the gonads is reflected in the number of germ cells (9). The number of germ cells in a DMY mutant identified from a wild population resembled that of the female (3). Therefore, we evaluated the effect of DMY on germ cell number in the transgenic F0 generation. The genomic DNA fragment with DMYHNI or Yamomoto's solution alone (control) was injected into one-cell-stage medaka embryos of the Qurt strain. The hatched fry were dissected into the head part, which was used for checking the genetic sex by genomic PCR-RFLP, and the body region, which was used for histological observation of the gonad (Fig. 4 A). The numbers of germ cells and their stages in fry that overexpressed DMY were compared with those of the control fry (Fig. 4 B–D). The DMY-injected XX fry had fewer germ cells than the controls at both 0 DAH (Fig. 4 B) and at 5 DAH (Fig. 4 C). Interestingly, the DMY-injected XY fry also had fewer germ cells than the control at 0 DAH. These differences were confirmed as significant by the t test (P < 0.05). In DMY-injected XX fry at 5 DAH, the numbers of germ cells were reduced at various stages of germ cell development (Fig. 4 D).Numbers of germ cells in transgenic and control medaka fry. (A) Schematic diagram depicting the procedure. Total numbers of germ cells at 0 DAH (B) and 5 DAH (C). Open circles represent individuals that have oocytes in the zygotene or pachytene stage, whereas filled circles represent individuals that lack oocytes in the zygotene or pachytene stage. (D) The numbers of germ cells at the different developmental stages of 5 DAH XX fry are shown. The control and DMY transgenic were compared within each stage. The results are presented as the mean ± SEM of each stage.The overexpression of DMY using the DMY genomic region induced sex reversal. However, because the genomic region used was large (117 kb), it could not be ruled out that a region within this 117-kb DNA segment but outside the DMY open reading frame (ORF) was involved in the induction of sex reversal. Therefore, to investigate the ability of the DMY ORF to induce sex reversal, we constructed overexpression vectors in which CMV controlled the DMY or DMRT1 cDNA. These constructs were injected into one-cell-stage medaka embryos of the Hd-rR strain, and the injected embryos were reared until the secondary sexual characteristics became apparent. Sex-reversed fish were obtained from the embryos that overexpressed DMY, whereas no sex-reversed fish were obtained from the embryos that overexpressed DMRT1 (Table 4). The sex-reversed medaka were fertile (data not shown).CMV promoter-directed overexpression of DMY and DMRT1A previous study has demonstrated that the DMY gene is necessary for normal male development (3). The present study shows that the overexpression of DMY by injecting the genomic region into XX individuals is sufficient to induce male development by reversing the sex of that individual. Furthermore, the overexpression of the DMY cDNA under the control of the CMV promoter also resulted in male development in XX individuals, which indicates that the protein encoded by the DMY ORF is sufficient for the induction of male development in XX medaka. Taken together with the previous data, our results indicate that DMY is the sex-determining gene in medaka. Thus, DMY is the first sex-determining gene to be identified in nonmammalian vertebrates.Two lines of evidence suggest that DMY arose from a recent duplication event of the autosomal DMRT1 genomic region. First, Y chromosome-linked DMY appears to have originated from a duplicate copy of autosomal DMRT1 (4, 5, 10, 11), and then, in the Y chromosome, the duplicated DMRT1 acquired a new function as a sex-determining gene, DMY. Second, DMY is also found in Oryzias curvinotus, which is most closely related to medaka (12), but is not found in other Oryzias species (O. celebensis, O. mekongensis) or in other fishes (guppy, tilapia, zebrafish, and fugu) (13). These results suggest that DMY is a recently evolved gene specific to some species of the genus Oryzias.DMY represents a strong motive force for testis development in gonads. In transgenic experiments, F0 embryos injected with DNA were typically mosaic. Likewise, F0 embryos injected with the DMY genomic fragment were expected to have mosaic gonads. This situation is comparable to the XX recipient and XY donor chimeras of medaka, some of which developed as males despite having only a few XY donor cells and XX recipient cells in the gonad (14). It was found that some of the chimeras with only XX germ cells also developed into males. It is evident that relatively few XY somatic cells are sufficient to reverse the sex of the germ cells and somatic cells of the XX recipient gonad. These results suggest that even if DMY is present in only a minority of somatic cells, the gonad can ultimately develop into a testis. We believe that this is why we observed a low masculinization rate in the experiments in which gonad histology was examined at 20 and 30 DAH, whereas we observed a high masculinization rate for the secondary sex characteristics of the adult stage.Some of the XX fish had slowly developing ovaries at 20 and 30 DAH. In this case, it appeared that the level of DMY expression in the XX gonad was low, and the gonad initially developed into an ovary. However, some of the somatic cells carried DMY, the expression of which should lead to testis development.DMY plays a role in the development of germ cells in males. The number of germ cells in many nonmammalian females is greater than in males at around the time of morphological sex differentiation (15–17). The germ cells in the females continue to proliferate and subsequently enter meiosis, in contrast to the male germ cells, which arrest in mitosis (9, 18). Kobayashi et al. (2004) demonstrated that the first appearance of a sex difference in germ cell number occurs at stage 38, before the hatching of medaka. Furthermore, in the XY gonads of medaka, the formation of the acinous structure occurs ≈10 DAH (19). These events are the first morphological signs of sex differentiation, as well as of testicular differentiation. Nevertheless, DMY expression starts in the somatic cells surrounding the germ cells, which are found in the coelomic epithelium under the nephric duct at stage 34 (9). This phenomenon occurs before the emergence of any sex differences in terms of germ cell number. When DMY does not function (e.g., a DMY mutant), the germ cells in XY embryos proliferate and enter meiosis, just like the XX embryos. In the DMY overexpression experiments, the total number of germ cells at 0 DAH was significantly reduced in both the XX and XY fry. In the 5 DAH XX fry injected with DMY, not only was the total germ cell number reduced but the number of germ cells at various stages of development was also reduced. Because the total number of germ cells reflects the outcome of active mitosis, the reduced number of germ cells in the transgenic fry may be due to a signal or signals from the surrounding somatic cells that express DMY.In mammals, the function of the X chromosome differs from that of the Y chromosome. The male-specific region of the Y chromosome contains 156 known transcriptional units, which include 78 protein-coding genes that collectively encode 27 distinct proteins, including 10 testis-specific genes and SRY (20). Chromosomally female transgenic mice that carry Sry develop into males that are sterile (2), which suggests that Sry is insufficient for complete male development. In contrast, the present study shows that DMY induces complete male development in XX medaka. This finding suggests that the functional difference between the X and Y chromosomes of medaka involves a single gene. Analyses of the genomic organization of the sex-determining regions and adjacent regions of the sex chromosomes of medaka have also suggested that DMY appears to be the only functional gene (5). Because most vertebrate species have chromosomal (genetic) sex-determining systems and no morphologically distinct sex chromosomes, as is the case with medaka, it is possible that the functional difference between the sex chromosomes is a single gene that determines the sex of the respective species.We used the three strains d-rR, Hd-rR, and Qurt. The d-rR and Hd-rR strains, in which the wild-type allele R of the r locus (a sex-linked pigment gene) is situated on the Y chromosome, was used to generate the transgenic fish with the DMY genomic region. In this case, the female X r X r had white body color, whereas the male X r Y R had orange-red body color (7). Another strain, Qurt [b/b, gu/gu, r/r,X(lf)/Y(+)], in which the genetic sex of the XX and XY fish can be distinguished by the presence or absence of leucophore (8), was also used for the generation of transgenic fish.The constructs for DMY transgenic fish were prepared by subcloning the BAC clone that was derived from the Y congenic strain Hd-rR.Y HNI (3), which contains the sex-determining region from the Y chromosome of the HNI strain and has the genetic background of the Hd-rR strain. The BAC clone (mCON051H1) containing DMY was digested with SfiI, recognition sites for which were located ≈1.4 kb downstream of DMY exon 6 and the vector sequence (Fig. 1). A biased sinusoidal field gel electrophoresis system (GENOFIELD; Atto Co., Tokyo, Japan) was used to isolate the DNA fragment that contained DMY. The gel electrophoresis conditions were as follows: 1% low-melting-point agarose gel in 0.5× TBE (44.5 mM Tris/44.5 mM boric acid/1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) at 20°C, dc 1.6 V/cm and ac 9.6 V/cm, and log-pulse time ramp from 0.01 to 0.2 Hz for 20 h. The DNA fragment was purified by using GELase (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI) and then ligated with the linker-ligated CopyControl pCC1 vector (Epicentre Technologies). This system combines the clone stability afforded by single-copy cloning with the advantages of the high yields of DNA obtained by “on-demand” induction of the clones to high copy number. The pCC1 vector was digested with HindIII and EcoRI and ligated with the Sfi-Hind linker (AGCTGAG) and Sfi-Eco linker (AATGGG). TransforMax EPI300 electro-competent cells (Epicentre Technologies) were used for transformation. Recombinant clones were grown in culture and induced by the addition of the CopyControl Induction Solution (Epicentre Technologies) to generate high plasmid copy numbers, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The clones were purified by using either a Large-Construct kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or CsCl-ethidium bromide gradient ultracentrifugation, which was preceded by purification by using the QIAfilter Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen).To construct CMV promoter-controlled overexpression vectors, the ORFs of DMY and DMRT1 were amplified from the total RNA of whole embryos for DMY and of adult testes for DMRT1 of the Hd-rR strain by using a OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) with the following primer sets: PG17.25 (CCC ACC AGA TCC TAT ACA AGT GAC) and PG17.89 (CAG CTT GTC GAC ATT TGG TTT CAC TGC TCA TGG A) for DMY, and PG17.25 and PG17.95 (CAG CTT GTC GAC ATT TGC TCT CGC TGC TCA TGG A) for DMRT1. Primer PG17.25 is located upstream of the ATG start site. Primers 17.89 and 17.95 are situated in the 3′ regions of DMY and DMRT1, respectively, and include the SalI restriction enzyme site but lack the stop codon. The RT-PCR products were cloned by using a Zero Blunt TOPO PCR Cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The clones were sequenced to exclude sequence alterations, and the authentic clones were chosen. Selected clones were digested with EcoRI and SalI, purified by gel electrophoresis, and ligated to EcoRI and SalI-digested pIRES-hrGFP-1a vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In these constructs, the cDNAs were fused to three contiguous copies of the FLAG epitope tag, followed by the internal ribosome entry site, which was further linked to the hrGFP coding sequence. The clones were purified by using a QIAfilter Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen).Fertilized eggs were collected within 15 min of spawning. The attaching filaments were scraped off the chorion on a piece of paper. Microinjection was carried out as described previously (21). For microinjection of the DMY genomic region, we used DNA at 50 ng/μl in Yamamoto's solution. For CMV promoter-directed overexpression, we used 45 ng/μl and 50 ng/μl of CMV-DMY and CMV-DMRT1, respectively, in Yamamoto's solution. The injected eggs were incubated at 26°C.The genetic sex of each specimen was determined by genomic PCR. For fry, the dissected head part was used for DNA extraction to assess the genetic sex while the body part was used for in situ hybridization analysis. Genomic PCR was performed by using the common primers for DMRT1 and DMY (PG17.5, CCG GGT GCC CAA GTG CTC CCG CTG; and PG17.6, GAT CGT CCC TCC ACA GAG AAG AGA). PCR conditions were as follows: 5 min at 95°C, followed by 30 cycles of 20 sec at 96°C, 30 sec at 55°C, and 30 sec at 72°C, followed by 5 min at 72°C. The length of the DMY PCR product was different from that of DMRT1, which made it easier to judge the genetic sex by using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.Total RNA and genomic DNA samples were extracted from each hatched embryo after homogenization in a 1.5-ml tube with 350 μl of the RLT buffer supplied with an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). The homogenized lysates were centrifuged, followed by RNA extraction protocol by using the RNeasy Mini kit and an RNase-Free DNase set (Qiagen). DNA was extracted from the pellet by using a DNeasy Tissue kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Genomic PCR to detect the transgene was performed by using the DMY-specific primers PG17.19 (GAA CCA CAG CTT GAA GAC CCC GCT GA) and PG17.20 (GCA TCT GCT GGT ACT GCT GGT AGT TG). The PCR conditions were as follows: 5 min at 94°C, followed by 30 cycles of 15 sec at 96°C, 60 sec at 68°C, and a final step of 5 min at 72°C. To distinguish the DMYd-rR and DMYHNI alleles, the PCR products were digested with StuI and electrophoresed in a 2% agarose gel.RT-PCR was performed by using a OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). For the RT-PCR, the PG17.25 (CCC ACC AGA TCC TAT ACA AGT GAC) and PG17.48 (GGC TGG TAG AAG TTG TAG TAG GAG GTT T) primers were used, and 100 ng of total RNA was used as the template in a 25-μl volume. The PCR conditions were as follows: 30 min at 55°C, 15 min at 95°C, followed by 30 cycles of 20 sec at 96°C, 30 sec at 55°C, 60 sec at 72°C, and a final step of 5 min at 72°C. The RT-PCR products were directly sequenced.To check the fertility of F0 transgenic medaka, transgenic F0 males were pair-mated with normal females or transgenic F0 females.For the histological analysis and counting of germ cell numbers, the embryos that were injected with the DMY genomic region were dissected into head and body segments. The body portions were fixed overnight in Bouin's fixative solution and then embedded in paraffin. Each dissected head was used to determine the genetic sex, according to the protocol listed in the Sexing section. Cross-sections were cut serially at 5-μm thickness, and after H&E staining, all of the germ cells were counted for each fry. After cell counting, the mean and standard error were calculated for each sex at each stage, and the differences between the sexes were evaluated statistically by using the paired t test for each stage.After the head part had been removed from the hatching fry, the body region with the gonad were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4°C overnight. In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (3, 9).We thank Ms. E. Uno for technical assistance.

Using degenerate PCR and RACE, we cloned the vasa gene of the rice field eel (Monopterus albus), which is homologous to the Drosophila vasa gene. We named it ma-vas (Monopterus albus vas). Ma-vas encodes a protein of 618 amino acids, which contains all of the known characteristics of vasa homologs. RT-PCR analysis revealed that ma-vas was exclusively expressed in the gonads of the female, intersex, and male. During gonadal natural sex reversal, ma-vas is expressed in oocytes at all stages of oogenesis, in degenerating oocytes of ovotestis, and in spermatogonia and spermatocytes at early stages. The vasa positive signal was also observed in the peripheral layer of late ovary. It was not found, however, in that layer of the testis. Alkaline phosphatase (AKP) staining on the ovary and testis also indicated that some cells had differentiational potential in the peripheral layer of the ovary, suggesting that spermatogonia might arise from cells with AKP and vasa-positive staining in the peripheral layer of the female gonad.The rice field eel, Monopterus albus, taxonomically belongs to the teleosts, family Synbranchidae, of the order Synbranchiformes (Neoteleostei, Teleostei, and Vertebrata), and it is the only representative of the Synbranchidae in China. This freshwater fish is important for fishery production and is a good model for comparative genomic studies of vertebrate sexual development, due to its unique characteristics, such as small genome size compared to other teleost fish and natural sex reversal from female via intersex into male during its life (Zhou et al., 2002).The vasa gene was first identified in Drosophila melanogaster by mutagenesis (Schu et al., 1986). It also has been cloned and characterized in other species: Caenorhabditis elegans (Gruidl et al., 1996; Kuznicki et al., 2000; Roussell and Bennett, 1993), Xenopus laevis (Komiya et al., 1994), Mus musculus (Fujiwara et al., 1994), Danio rerio (Olsen et al., 1997; Yoon et al., 1997), Dugesia japonica (Shibata et al., 1999), Homo sapiens (Castrillon et al., 2000), Oncorhynchus mykiss (Yoshizaki et al., 2000), Oryzias latipes (Shimomiya et al., 2000), Oreochromis niloticus (Kobayashi et al., 2000), Gallus gallus (Tsunekawa et al., 2000), Ciona savignyi (Fujimura and Takamura, 2000), Cyprinus carpio (Knaut et al., 2002), Bos taurus (Pennetier et al., 2004), and Carassius auratus gibelio (Xu et al., 2005). The vasa gene encodes an ATP-dependent RNA helicase member of the DEAD-box family of proteins (Liang et al., 1994). In Drosophila, the vasa gene is responsible for mutations that cause a deficiency in the formation of germline precursor cells (Lasko and Ashburner, 1988; Styhler et al., 1998; Tomancak et al., 1998); during early stages of oogenesis and spermatogenesis, the vasa gene is required for the development of oocytes and spermatocytes (Styhler et al., 1998; Tomancak et al., 1998). In the case of the Caenorhabditis elegans vasa homolog (Glh), an essential role for germline segregation has been demonstrated by the injection of antisense RNA (Gruidl et al., 1996). In addition, microinjection of VASA antibody into early Xenopus embryos drastically reduces the number of primordial germ cells (PGCs) in the germinal ridge (Ikenishi and Tanaka, 1997), suggesting that VASA is an essential factor for PGC formation or migration to the germinal ridge. In male mice, if homozygous for a targeted mutation of vasa, this caused the premeiosis of germ cells to cease differentiation at the zygotene stage and to undergo apoptosis. In zebrafish, Yoon et al. (1997) showed that transcripts of the vasa homolog were localized only in PGCs, and vasa RNA positive cells could be traced back to several cells in cleavage stages. In frog, mouse, zebrafish, medaka, and rainbow trout, vasa was specifically expressed in germ cells (Fujiwara et al., 1994; Komiya et al., 1994; Olsen et al., 1997; Shimomiya et al., 2000; Yoon et al., 1997; Yoshizaki et al., 2000).Many efforts had been made to uncover the mechanism underlying gonadal natural sex reversal in the rice field eel, including at the cytological level (Xiao, 1993, 1995; Xiao and Liu, 1995), from the physiological and biochemical aspect (Chan, 1975, 1977; Fan et al., 1999; Liu et al., 1987; Zou, 2000), and at the molecular level (Lu et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2003; Xia et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2003). The mechanism of sex reversal in this species, however, remains unclear. To explore the potential roles of vasa in germ-cell development during sex reversal, we cloned and characterized the vasa homolog in the rice field eel. We also examined its expression pattern in gonads of the female, intersex, and male by in situ hybridization (ISH).The rice field eels were captured from the countryside of Wuchang, Wuhan, P. R. China. Their sexes were confirmed by gonad histochemistry.Extractions of RNA from nine different tissues, including gonads of male, female, and intersex, were carried out according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (1987). All RNAs were treated with RNase-free DNase I, purified by phenol-chloroform, and then precipitated by ethanol. Finally, RNAs were dissolved in DEPC-treated ddH2O. About 1.5 μg RNAs from testis was used as the template for reverse transcription using primer 3′ CDS for 3′ RACE. For 5′ RACE, the common primer 5′ CDS was used when the cDNA was ligated with the adaptor primer SM-2A. The template for degenerate PCR was reverse transcribed using an OligoT(18) primer. The reactions were performed in a 20 μL reaction volume using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Gibco-BRL).Four pairs of primers were designed to amplify the vasa-like cDNA fragments from testis using the degenerate PCR and thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR (TAIL-PCR) methods (Liu and Whittier, 1995). To obtain the 5′ and 3′ regions of the transcript, 5′ RACE and 3′ RACE were performed. Each PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced with an ABI377 sequencer according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Song et al., 1999). The complete CDS was also cloned and sequenced (Table I).RT-PCR was used to amplify the 3′ region of vasa cDNA from nine different tissues (ovary, ovotestis, testis, brain, kidney, liver, spleen, heart, muscle) of the rice field eel. The primers for β-actin were designed according to the rice field eel β-actin cDNA sequence (Accession no. AY345056) (Table I).The nucleotide sequence of the vasa gene and the putative amino acid sequence were analyzed using the NCBI BlastN server and NCBI BlastP server, respectively. The vasa proteins from 18 species were aligned by ClustalX 1.8 (Thompson et al., 1997). The neighbor-joining method as well as a protein maximum likelihood method were used to construct phylogenetic trees with Phylip (Phylogeny Inference Package, version 3.6a). Bootstrap analyses with 2000 replicates for the neighbor-joining method and 100 replicates for the maximum likelihood method were performed and the percentages reported.Sense and antisense RNA probes, labeled with digoxigenin-11-UTP, were in vitro transcribed, using SP6 RNA polymerase for production of the sense probe and T7 RNA polymerase for the antisense probe. The sequences of probes correspond to the 764nt-1312nt of the ma-vas cDNA. Testis, ovotestis, and ovary tissues from rice field eel were frozen and sectioned in 10 μm thicknesses. ISH was carried out according to Lv et al. (2005).The full-length cDNA of the rice field eel vasa-like gene (ma-vas) was 2267 bp, comprising an open reading frame of 1857 bp, a stop codon (TAG), and a 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of 319 bp. The predicted protein is 618 aa long and contains eight consensus sequences characteristic of the DEAD-box protein family (Fig. 1). The N-terminal region is rich in glycine (G), which is found in a number of putative RNA-binding proteins (Schmid and Linder, 1992). The N-terminal region also contains six arginine-glycine (RG) motifs and four arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) motifs (data not shown). In the C-terminal region, the last six amino acids are mainly acidic residues (aspartate D and glutamate E), a motif found in several single-stranded nucleic acid binding proteins (Hay et al., 1988). Additionally, a region (PGMSKE) was found conserved in the vertebrate VASA among the selected organisms (Fig. 1).Alignment of the rice field eel vasa protein (Accession no. ABA54551) with other vasa homolog proteins from 17 species, including fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster, AAA29013), nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans, AAC28387), zebrafish (Danio rerio, BAA22535), Prussian carp (Carassius auratus gibelio, AAV70960), common carp (Cyprinus carpio, AAL87139), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, BAA88059), medaka (Oryzias latipes, BAB61047), xenopus (Xenopus laevis, AAC03114), chicken (Gallus gallus, NP 990039), mouse (Mus musculus, NP 034159), human (Homo sapiens, AAF72705), pig (Sus scrofa, AAT46129), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus, BAB19807), gobies (Leucopsarion petersii, BAD04052), planarian (Dugesia japonica, BAA34993), ascidian (Ciona savignyi, BAB12217), and cow (Bos taurus, NP 001007820) by ClustalX 1.8. Eight conserved regions of the DEAD-box protein family, including an ATP-A motif and an ATP-B motif, are indicated in boxes. The sequence below the bar is the PGMPSK region conserved in vertebrates among the selected organisms.The alignment of the rice field eel vasa protein (Accession no. ABA54551) with VASA homologs of other animals showed that the VASA homolog is highly conserved in evolution (Fig. 1). The neighbor-joining (NJ) tree and the maximum-likelihood (ML) tree were generated based on two different models, which may cause a slight difference in the invertebrate subgroup between these two trees. They showed great similarity in the vertebrate subgroup, however, particularly in the teleost fishes subgroup. The two molecular phylogenetic trees of VASA were consistent with the taxonomic correlation based on morphology. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the VASA of the rice field eel was clustered within the ML tree and in the NJ tree. The reliability was 100% in the ML tree and 97.1% in the NJ tree (Fig. 2). The data suggested that the rice field eel and the Nile tilapia were most closely related among the 18 species.Phylogenetic trees containing vasa proteins from 18 species including rice field eel. Deduced amino acid sequences were aligned using ClustalX. Bootstrapping with 2000 replicates was used to generate multiple data sets of the input protein alignment data set. The unrooted tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method. The model of amino acid substitution for the neighbor-joining method is based on Kimura’s distance formula (Kimura, 1983). The unrooted maximum-likelihood tree, based on the Dayhoff PAM amino acid change model, was generated with 100 replicates (Dayhoff and Eck, 1968; Dayhoff et al., 1979).RT-PCR was used to determine the tissue distribution of ma-vas with gene-specific primers MoV-3UP1 and MoV-3UTR1. The results showed that ma-vas was not expressed in brain, kidney, liver, spleen, heart, or muscle, while it is specially expressed in the ovary, ovotestis, and testis (Fig. 3).Analysis of ma-vas RNA distribution in adult tissues by RT-PCR. β-actin was used as the positive control. Lanes: Ov, ovotestis; O, ovary; T, testis; B, brain; K, kidney; L, liver; S, spleen; H, heart; M, muscle.To study the role of the vasa-like gene in germ-cell development during sexual transformation, we performed ISH on cryosections with sense and antisense digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes. The rice field eel ovary was composed mainly of early oocytes and follicles at later stages of oogenesis and a small number of oogonia. The strong signal of vasa RNA was observed to be uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm of oogonia and early oocytes (Fig. 4). As oocyte growth proceeded, the vasa RNA signals became much weaker in the cytoplasm of vitellogenic and postvitellogenic oocytes but remained evident at the cortical region of the oocytes (arrows in Fig. 4). In addition, no vasa-positive signal was observed in nuclei of germ cells at any stage, which is consistent with observations in zebrafish and tilapia (Howly and Ho, 2000; Kobayashi et al., 2000).DMY is the second vertebrate sex-determining gene identified from the fish, Oryzias latipes. In this study, we used two different ways of sex reversal, DMY knock-down and estradiol-17β (E2) treatment, to determine the possible function of DMY during early gonadal sex differentiation in XY medaka. Our findings revealed that the mitotic and meiotic activities of the germ cells in the 0 day after hatching (dah) DMY knock-down XY larvae were identical to those of the normal XX larvae, suggesting the microenvironment of these XY gonads to be similar to that of the normal XX gonad, where DMY is naturally absent. Conversely, E2 treatment failed to initiate mitosis in the XY gonad, possibly due to an active DMY, even though it could initiate meiosis. Present study is the first to prove that the germ cells in the XY gonad can resume the mitotic activity, if DMY was knocked down.These authors contributed equally to this work.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Learn about our remote access optionsThe teleost fish, Oryzias curvinotus, is a closely related species to the medaka, Oryzias latipes, and both species have the DMY gene, which is required for male development in O. latipes. It suggests that the molecular function of the DMY gene and the following molecular events of sex differentiation are conserved between these two species. In the present study, we obtained interspecific hybrids between O. curvinotus and O. latipes and demonstrated sex‐reversed XY females in the hybrids. The incidence of sex‐reversed females in F1 XY hybrids between O. curvinotus females and O. latipes males, and hybrids between O. latipes females and O. curvinotus males were 21% and 100%, respectively. These results indicate that DMY does not always determine maleness in hybrid fish even though it is able to specify normal male development on its native genetic background and suggest that there are some differences between DMYlatipes and DMYcurvinotus alleles. Appearance of XY females in F1 hybrids also suggests that an autosomal or X‐liked gene(s) from the maternal species interferes in the function of the paternal DMY gene in the male‐determining process of the hybrid fish. These hybrid fish would supply a new experimental approach for investigating the genetic and molecular pathway of testis determination and differentiation. J. Exp. Zool. 305A, 2006. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.Volume305A, Issue101 October 2006Pages 890-896Copyright © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc., A Wiley CompanyAdvanced SearchThe medaka, Oryzias latipes, has an XX/XY sex-determination mechanism. A Y-linked DM domain gene, DMY, has been isolated by positional cloning as a sex-determining gene in this species. Previously, we found 23 XY sex-reversed females from 11 localities by examining the genotypic sex of wild-caught medaka. Genetic analyses revealed that all these females had Y-linked gene mutations. Here, we aimed to clarify the cause of this sex reversal. To achieve this, we screened for mutations in the amino acid coding sequence of DMY and examined DMY expression at 0 days after hatching (dah) using densitometric semiquantitative RT–PCR. We found that the mutants could be classified into two groups. One contained mutations in the amino acid coding sequence of DMY, while the other had reduced DMY expression at 0 dah although the DMY coding sequence was normal. For the latter, histological analyses indicated that YwOurYwOur (YwOur, Y chromosome derived from an Oura XY female) individuals with the lowest DMY expression among the tested mutants were expected to develop into females at 0 dah. These results suggest that early testis development requires DMY expression above a threshold level. Mutants with reduced DMY expression may prove valuable for identifying DMY regulatory elements.IN vertebrates, the sex of an individual is established by the sex of the gonad and, in most cases, whether a gonad becomes a testis or an ovary is determined by the genome of that individual. In most mammals, the Y chromosome-specific gene SRY/Sry is the master male-determining gene (Gubbay et al. 1990; Sinclair et al. 1990; Koopman et al. 1991). The SRY gene encodes a testis-specific transcription factor that plays a key role in sexual differentiation and development in males (Lovell-Badge et al. 2002). Non-mammalian vertebrates also have a male heterogametic (XX–XY) sex-determination system, but no homolog of Sry could be found.In the teleost medaka fish, Oryzias latipes, which has an XX–XY sex-determining system (Aida 1921), DMY (DM domain gene on the Y chromosome) has been found in the sex-determining region on the Y chromosome (Matsuda et al. 2002; Nanda et al. 2002). This gene is the first sex-determining gene to be found among non-mammalian vertebrates. DMY encodes a protein containing a DM domain, which is a DNA-binding motif found in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans (DSX and MAB-3, respectively) that is involved in sexual development (Raymond et al. 1998). The cDNA sequences of medaka DMY and DMRT1 are highly similar and DMY appears to have originated through duplication of an autosomal segment containing the DMRT1 region (Nanda et al. 2002; Kondo et al. 2004). DMY is specifically expressed in pre-Sertoli cells, somatic cells that surround primordial germ cells (PGCs), in the early gonadal primordium before any morphological sex differences are seen (Matsuda et al. 2002; Kobayashi et al. 2004). In the medaka, the first indication of morphological sex differences is a difference in the number of germ cells between the sexes at hatching (Satoh and Egami 1972; Quirk and Hamilton 1973; Hamaguchi 1982; Kobayashi et al. 2004). It is considered that one of the functions of DMY is to act as a factor that regulates the proliferation of PGCs via Sertoli cells in a sex-specific manner and controls testicular differentiation (Kobayashi et al. 2004).In humans, mutations in the SRY gene result in XY sex reversal and pure gonadal dysgenesis (Jager et al. 1990). However, mutations in the SRY gene itself are considered to account for only 10–15% of 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis cases, and the majority of the remaining cases may have mutation(s) in SRY regulatory elements or other genes involved in the sex differentiation pathway (Cameron and Sinclair 1997). A number of genes have been identified as having roles in the sexual development pathway through analyses of human sexual anomaly cases and/or functional studies in mice (Koopman 2001).Sex-reversal mutants in medaka are also useful for revealing the molecular function of DMY and identifying other genes involved in sex determination and differentiation. Analyses of such mutants may lead to further understanding of the molecular mechanisms of sex differentiation. In the present study, we identified two types of DMY mutants derived from wild populations of medaka. The first type is composed of loss-of-function mutants that contain mutations at the 3′ region of the DM domain, suggesting that the 3′ region of the DM domain is required for the normal function of DMY, male sex determination, and development. The second type is composed of reduced DMY expression mutants that have lower levels of DMY transcripts and contain a number of germ cells, including oocytes, at hatching. Taken together, these results suggest that early testis development requires DMY expression above a threshold level and support the hypothesis that DMY acts as a factor regulating PGC proliferation via Sertoli cells during early gonadal differentiation.In our previous study, we surveyed 2274 wild-caught fish from 40 localities throughout Japan and 730 fish from 69 wild stocks from Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan and identified 23 XY females from 11 localities (Shinomiya et al. 2004). Genetic analyses revealed that the XY females from 8 localities produced all female XYm (Ym, Y chromosome derived from an XY female) progeny, while those from 3 localities yielded both male and female XYm progeny (Table 1), suggesting that all these wild XY females had Y-linked gene mutations. In this study, we established mutant strains from these XY female mutants. The XY females from northern populations were mated with XY males of an inbred strain Hd-rR (Hyodo-Taguchi 1996) and the XY females from southern populations were mated with a congenic strain Hd-rR.YHNI (Matsuda et al. 1998). The F1 progeny from each pair were grown and their genotypes were determined, since the DMY gene of the northern population, including the HNI inbred strain, contains 21 nucleotide deletions in intron 2 compared to the southern population, including the Hd-rR strain (Shinomiya et al. 2004). When an XY female produced all female F1 XYm progeny, an F1 XYm female was mated with an F1 YYm male to produce F2 YmYm females. Next, an F2 YmYm female was mated with an F2 YYm male to establish mutant strains producing YmYm females and YYm males in later generations. When an XY female produced male and female F1 XYm progeny, an F1 XYm female was mated with an F1 YYm male to produce F2 YmYm males. Next, an F2 YmYm male was mated with an F2 XYm female to establish mutant strains producing XYm males and females and YmYm males in later generations. These mutant strains were used for RT–PCR and histological analyses.To screen for mutations in the amino acid coding sequence of DMY, exons 2–6 of DMY were PCR-amplified from caudal fin clip DNA using the following primer sets: exon 2: PG17ex2.1, 5′-GGA GTC ACG TGA CCC TCT TTC TTG GG-3′ and PG17ex2.2, 5′-TTT CGG GTG AAC TCA CAT GGT TGT CG-3′; exon 3: PG17ex3.1, 5′-GCA ACA GAG AGT TGG ATT TAC GTC TCA-3′ and PG17ex3.2, 5′-CTT TTG ACT TCA GTT TGA CAC ATC AAT G-3′; exon 4: PG17ex4.1, 5′-CTC AGG TTT GAC TTG GAT GCT GAC CTG A-3′ and PG17ex4.2, 5′-CAA ACC AGG CCA TGA CCA TTC CGA-3′; exon 5: PG17ex5.1, 5′-CCG ATT CTA GCG GAT GAT GCC ACC-3′ and PG17ex5.2, 5′-GGG AGC CAA AAA TGC GCC ACA TAA-3′; and exon 6: PG17ex6.1, 5′-GTC ATT AAC ACA ACG CAC AAC AAC TT-3′ and PG17ex6.2, 5′-AAA AAC CAG AAG ACC CGA GAG GAA G-3′ (Figure 1A). The PCR products were sequenced directly in an ABI Prism 310 automated sequencer.Total RNA was extracted from embryos or fry at 9.5 days after fertilization in Kesen-numa G2, Shirone G2, Aizu-Wakamatsu G2, and Oura G4 generations using an RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN) and subjected to RT–PCR using a OneStep RT–PCR kit (QIAGEN). Aliquots (20 ng) of the total RNA samples were used as templates in 25-μl reaction volumes. The PCR conditions were: 30 min at 55°; 15 min at 95°; cycles of 20 sec at 96°, 30 sec at 55°, and 60 sec at 72°; and 5 min at 72°. The number of cycles for each gene was adjusted to be within the linear range of amplification, specifically 36 cycles for DMY and 24 cycles for β-actin. The primers for DMY (DMYspe, 5′-TGC CGG AAC CAC AGC TTG AAG ACC-3′ and 48U, 5′-GGC TGG TAG AAG TTG TAG TAG GAG GTT T-3′) amplified a 404-bp DNA fragment. The primers for β-actin (3b, 5′-CMG TCA GGA TCT TCA TSA GG-3′ and 4, 5′-CAC ACC TTC TAC AAT GAG CTG A-3′) amplified a 322-bp DNA fragment. Aliquots of 8 and 4 μl of the DMY and β-actin RT–PCR products, respectively, were electrophoresed in a 2% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer and stained with ethidium bromide. The gels were visualized by UV transillumination and photographed with a Geldoc 2000 (Bio-Rad). The optical density of each band was quantified by densitometry using Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad) and represented as the ratio of DMY mRNA to β-actin mRNA in arbitrary units. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for statistically significant differences among XYHNI, XYHd-rR, and XY sex-reversal mutants, and the Games/Howell post hoc test for multiple comparisons was applied.The fry of the Kesen-numa G2 and Oura G4 generations at 0 and 10 days after hatching (dah) were cut to separate the head and body. The body portions were fixed in Bouin's fixative solution overnight and then embedded in paraffin. The heads were used to determine the genotype. Serial cross-sections (5 μm thick) of the body portions were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Germ cells were counted in each fry at 0 dah. After the cell counting, the mean number and SE were calculated for the Oura G4 generation and the differences between YwOurYwOur and YHNIYwOur individuals were evaluated statistically by paired t-tests. Gonadal sex differentiation at 10 dah was examined for the presence or absence of diplotene oocytes.To identify mutations in the DMY amino acid coding sequence, we sequenced exons 2–6 of DMY (Figure 1A) in 23 XY sex-reversed females from 11 localities. Four types of mutations were identified in 15 XY females from 7 localities. One Awara (Matsuda et al. 2002), 2 Aomori, 1 Aizu-Bange, and 6 Kurobe XY females contained a C insertion in a polyC tract specific to the northern population in exon 3 (Figure 1, A and C), which caused a frameshift from residue 110 (designated N110fsinsC) and resulted in premature termination at residue 139 (Figure 1B). An XY female from Suzu contained a C deletion in the same polyC tract in exon 3 (Figure 1, A and C), which caused a frameshift from residue 109 (designated 109fsdelC) and resulted in premature termination at residue 203 (Figure 1B). An XY female from Aki contained a C deletion in another site in exon 3 (Figure 1, A and C), which caused a frameshift from residue 102 (designated S102fsdelC) and resulted in premature termination at residue 104 (Figure 1, B and C). Three XY females from Saigo had normal DMY exons 2–5, but PCR for exon 6 (using primers PG17ex6.1 and PG17ex6.2; Figure 1A) and 3′-RACE using RNA extracted from G2 YwSaiYwSai (YwSai, Y chromosome derived from a Saigo XY female) fry at 0 dah did not produce any amplified bands (data not shown), suggesting that the DMY gene of these Saigo XY females may contain a large insertion or deletion in intron 5 and/or exon 6 and have no polyadenylation signal. The XY females from Awara, Aomori, Aizu-Bange, Kurobe, Suzu, Aki, and Saigo that contained mutations in the amino acid coding sequence produced all female XYm progeny in the G1 generation (Table 1), indicating their mutant DMY genes were nonfunctional.Structure and sequences of DMY.

The Suzu XY female has a cytosine deletion at amino acid 109 (designated P109fsdelC), the Awara XY female has a cytosine insertion at amino acid 110 (designated N110fsinsC), and the Aki XY female has a cytosine deletion at amino acid 102 (designated S102fsdelC), each of which results in a frameshift and premature termination.List of XY sex-reversal mutants from wild populations of medakaThe XY females from Shirone, Aizu-Wakamatsu, Kesen-numa, and Oura produced sex-reversed XYm female progeny in the G1 generation, although the amino acid coding sequence of DMY was normal. To investigate the patterns of inheritance for sex reversal in more detail, we performed further genetic analyses for the Oura and Kesen-numa XY females.For Oura, G1 XYwOur (YwOur, Y chromosome derived from an Oura XY female) progeny produced from a mating between the XY female and an Hd-rR.YHNI male developed as all female (Figure 2A), suggesting that YwOur had lost the male-determining function. Since YHNIYwOur did not appear in the G1 generation, another G1 XYwOur female was mated with the Hd-rR.YHNI male. All 33 G3 YwOurYwOur progeny produced from a mating between a G2 XYwOur female and a G2 YHNIYwOur male developed as female (Figure 2A). This result confirmed that YwOur has lost the male-determining function.Schemes illustrating genetic crosses for XY females from Oura and Kesen-numa. (A) The Oura XY female produced all female XYwOur progeny in the G1, G2, and G3 generations (boxes with a solid line). Since YHNIYwOur did not appear in the G1 generation (underlined), a G1 XYwOur female was mated with the Hd-rR.YHNI male again. All 33 YwOurYwOur individuals developed into females in the G3 generation (dotted box). (B) The Kesen-numa XY female produced male and female XYwKsn progeny in the G1 and G2 generations (boxes with a solid line). All 41 YwKsnYwKsn individuals developed into males in the G2 generation (dotted box). YHNIYwOur and YHNIYwKsn individuals developed into normal males in adulthood.For Kesen-numa, G1 XYwKsn (YwKsn, Y chromosome derived from a Kesen-numa XY female) progeny produced from a mating between the XY female and an Hd-rR.YHNI male were either male or female, similar to the case for the Shirone XY female (Matsuda et al. 2002). Interestingly, we observed only 4 females among 18 XYwKsn in the G1 generation, while 22 XYwKsn females were observed among 35 XYwKsn in the G2 generation (Figure 2B). Conversely, all 41 G2 YwKsnYwKsn produced from a mating between a G1 XYwKsn female and a G1 YHNIYwKsn male developed as male (Figure 2B), suggesting that two YwKsn chromosomes are sufficient for male determination and development. YHNIYwKsn and YHNIYwOur, which contained normal Y chromosomes from the Hd-rR.YHNI congenic strain, developed into normal males in adulthood.The XY females from Shirone had reduced or faint DMY expression at 0 dah (Matsuda et al. 2002). To define the relationship between sex reversal and the DMY expression level, we detected DMY transcripts at 0 dah for Kesen-numa G2, Aizu-Wakamatsu G2, Shirone G2, and Oura G4 generations that produced sex-reversed females, despite a normal amino acid coding sequence of DMY. To measure the DMY expression levels semiquantitatively, we performed densitometric RT–PCR. The mRNA levels of DMY were calibrated by those of β-actin (Figure 3A) and are shown as the ratios of DMY mRNA to β-actin mRNA in arbitrary units (Figure 3B). Statistical analyses using the Games/Howell post hoc test revealed that the DMY mRNA level was significantly lower in YwKsnYwKsn than in males of XYHd-rR and XYHNI, although YwKsnYwKsn developed as all male in adulthood. The statistical analyses further revealed that the DMY mRNA levels were significantly lower in XYwKsn, XYwSrn (YwSrn, Y chromosome derived from a Shirone XY female), and XYwWkm (YwWkm, Y chromosome derived from an Aizu-Wakamatsu XY female), which developed as male or female in adulthood, as well as in YwOurYwOur, which developed as all female in adulthood, than in males of XYHd-rR, XYHNI, and YwKsnYwKsn (Figure 3B).Expression levels of the DMY transcript at 0 dah in XYHNI, XYHd-rR, and XY sex-reversal mutants.

Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between the mean values: *P < 0.05 compared with XYHNI and XYHd-rR; **P < 0.05 compared with XYHNI, XYHd-rR, and YwKsnYwKsn.We carried out histological observations for the Oura G4 and Kesen-numa G2 generations at 0 and 10 dah to reveal the early gonadal development of the mutants with reduced DMY expression. It is well known that the number of germ cells in many non-mammalian females is greater than that in males around the time of morphological sex differentiation (Van Limborgh 1975; Zust and Dixon 1977; Nakamura et al. 1998). Thereafter, the germ cells in females continue to proliferate and then enter into meiosis, while the male germ cells arrest in mitosis. We counted the number of germ cells at 0 dah (Figure 4), which represents the time of the initial appearance of morphological sex differences in medaka (Satoh and Egami 1972; Quirk and Hamilton,1973; Hamaguchi 1982). Around hatching, germ cells in XX individuals outnumber those in XY individuals (Hamaguchi 1982; Kobayashi et al. 2004) and subsequently germ cells enter mitotic arrest in XY fry, whereas they go into meiosis in XX fry after hatching (Satoh and Egami 1972). Further, we examined the early gonadal development according to the presence or absence of diplotene oocytes at 10 dah (Table 2; Figure 5). In this period, the female germ cells are recognizable as oocytes from histological observations since the fry in putative male contain no germ cells in the meiotic prophase, while those in putative female contain germ cells both in mitosis and in the meiotic prophase (Satoh and Egami 1972).Germ-cell numbers of mutants with reduced DMY expression at 0 dah in the Oura G4 (A) and Kesen-numa G2 (B) generations.

Bars, 10 μm.Gonadal development at 10 dah in mutant linesFor Oura, YwOurYwOur, with the lowest DMY expression levels among the tested mutants, contained a number of germ cells, including oocytes, at 0 dah (Figure 4A), similar to normal XX females, and all eight YwOurYwOur had diplotene oocytes at 10 dah (Table 2; Figure 5B). These results suggest that YwOurYwOur develops as female in the same manner as normal XX females. YHNIYwOur, with a normal Y chromosome from the Hd-rR.YHNI congenic strain, had a significantly lower germ-cell number at 0 dah than YwOurYwOur (Figure 4A), and no oocytes were observed at either 0 or 10 dah (Table 2; Figure 5A). These results suggest that YHNIYwOur develops as male in the same manner as normal XY males.For Kesen-numa, YwKsnYwKsn and XYwKsn, with reduced DMY expression, had a number of germ cells, including oocytes, at 0 dah (Figure 4B). However, at 10 dah all eight YwKsnYwKsn had a small number of germ cells and no diplotene oocytes (Table 2; Figure 5F), similar to normal males. These results suggest that some of the YwKsnYwKsn germ cells proliferate like those in normal females at hatching, but the mutants develop as male by 10 dah. Conversely, 14 of 16 XYwKsn had diplotene oocytes at 10 dah (Table 2; Figure 5D) and the remaining 2 XYwKsn had a small number of germ cells and no diplotene oocytes at 10 dah (Table 2; Figure 5C). These results are consistent with the observations that XYwKsn were either male or female in adulthood and that the number of females was greater than that of males in the G2 generation. Some XYwKsn individuals would probably develop as females in the same manner as normal females. XYHNI and YHNIYwKsn, with a normal Y chromosome from the Hd-rR.YHNI congenic strain, contained no diplotene oocytes at either 0 or 10 dah (Table 2; Figure 5E), indicating that these individuals would develop as normal males.The results of this study indicate that all XY sex-reversal mutants discovered among wild populations of medaka are associated with defective DMY and can be classified into two types. One type contains mutations in the amino acid coding sequence of DMY (Awara, Aomori, Aizu-Bange, Kurobe, Suzu, Aki, and Saigo), while the other type has a normal coding sequence but reduced DMY expression at 0 dah (Shirone, Aizu-Wakamatsu, Kesen-numa, and Oura).In humans, mutations in SRY are associated with male-to-female sex reversal and a number of mutations have been identified within the SRY gene open reading frame (Shahid et al. 2004). Although nonsense mutations are scattered throughout the SRY gene, missense mutations tend to cluster in the central region of the gene, which encodes the high-mobility group (HMG) domain (Harley et al. 2003). In total, 43 of 53 missense mutations identified in the SRY gene open reading frame are located in the HMG domain (Shahid et al. 2004), strongly suggesting that the DNA-binding motif is essential in vivo. Conversely, only 10 mutations that lie outside the HMG domain have been detected. Among these, 7 are located in the 5′ region and 3 are located in the 3′ region of the HMG domain and all have different effects on the patient phenotype (Shahid et al. 2004). It is hypothesized that the region outside the HMG domain may be required to stabilize protein binding and/or to generate specificity by helping to discriminate between protein partners (Wilson and Koopman 2002).The results of the present study demonstrate the occurrence of three types of DMY frameshift mutations. N110fsinsC was found in four populations (Awara, Aomori, Aizu-Bange, and Kurobe), while P109fsdelC was found in Suzu and S102fsdelC was found in Aki. The N110fsinsC and P109fsdelC frameshift mutations are present in the same polyC tract in exon 3, which is specific to the northern population. These mutations may have occurred independently in different populations, implying that this region is a mutational hot spot in the DMY gene, similar to the case for the human transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1a, which contains a polyC tract in exon 4 (Kaisaki et al.1997). The finding that all XYm containing each of N110fsinsC, P109fsdelC, and S102fsdelC in DMY developed as female in adulthood indicates that the mutated DMY genes do not have the male-determining function, although they contain the intact DM domain. Taken together, these results suggest that the 3′ region of the DM domain is indispensable for fulfilling the male-determining function of DMY.In mice, XY sex reversal is associated with two types of mutation that appear to exert their effects by suppressing the Sry expression level. First, deletion of repeat sequences at some distance proximal to Sry on the mouse Y short arm results in reduced expression and sex reversal (Capel et al. 1993). Second, the sex reversal observed when crossing a Mus mus musculus strain Poschiavinus Y chromosome (YPOS) onto a M. m. domesticus background (in particular C57BL6) (Eicher et al. 1982) has been attributed to a reduced Sry expression level from YPOS. Using a semiquantitative RT–PCR assay, Nagamine et al. (1999) showed that the levels of Sry expression from different mouse Y chromosomes are correlated with the degree of sex reversal they cause on an M. m. domesticus background. It appears that a critical threshold level must be achieved by a certain stage of genital ridge development for the supporting cell population to be pushed toward Sertoli cell differentiation.In medaka, DMY expression first appears just before hatching and morphological sex differences are seen, whereas the expression of autosomal gene DMRT1 first occurs at 20–30 dah (Kobayashi et al. 2004). The present results demonstrate that the DMY expression levels at 0 dah in XYwKsn, XYwSrn, XYwWk, and YwOurYwOu, which produced sex-reversed females, are significantly reduced to less than half the levels in males of XYHNI and XYHd-rR. These results suggest that an underlying cause of XY sex reversal is a reduced level of DMY mRNA during a critical period of sex determination. It is interesting to note that YwKsnYwKsn developed as all male in adulthood, although their DMY mRNA level was significantly lower than that in XYHNI and XYHd-rR. Therefore, we consider that the certain threshold level of DMY mRNA required for male determination at 0 dah lies between the YwKsnYwKsn and XYwKsn mRNA levels.In mice, Sry is expressed in pre-Sertoli cells (Albrecht and Eicher 2001) and required for male determination by means of promotion of Sertoli cell differentiation (Swain and Lovell-Badge 1999). In medaka, DMY is expressed in the pre-Sertoli cells (Matsuda et al. 2002; Kobayashi et al. 2004) and assumed to act as a factor that induces the development of pre-Sertoli cells into Sertoli cells in XY gonads, which is involved in the regulation of PGC proliferation as well as construction of the testicular tissue architecture (Matsuda 2005).In the present study, we demonstrated reduced DMY expression at 0 dah in sex-reversed mutant strains. There are two possible causes for this reduced DMY expression: (1) the number of DMY-expressing cells is normal but the level of DMY transcription per cell is severely reduced or (2) the number of DMY-expressing cells is significantly reduced but the level of DMY transcription per cell is normal. Either of these possibilities could severely affect the development of pre-Sertoli cells into Sertoli cells. It is interesting to note that some XX recipient and XY donor chimeras of medaka develop into males that have only XX germ cells (Shinomiya et al. 2002). These results suggest that the XY somatic donor cells, the minor component in these chimeras, could induce sex reversal of the XX germ cells and the XX somatic cells. From these results, we infer that the latter possibility is unlikely to cause sex reversal, and it is reasonable to assume that the former possibility is the cause of the reduced DMY expression.Our finding that YwOurYwOur develops as female in the same manner as normal XX females indicates that a low DMY mRNA level below the threshold level may lead to failure of DMY-positive cells to further differentiate into Sertoli cells. Since Sertoli cells are necessary for regulating PGC proliferation, lower levels of DMY transcripts lead to gonad development as phenotypic females. In contrast, the fact that YwKsnYwKsn develops as all male by 10 dah suggests that a DMY mRNA level above the threshold level at the sex-determining period is necessary for pre-Sertoli cells to undergo further differentiation. However, some YwKsnYwKsn individuals contain a number of germ cells, including oocytes, at 0 dah. This result implies that slightly reduced DMY expression may lead to a reduction in pre-Sertoli cell development into Sertoli cells. Moreover, some XYwKsn develop as females and the remainder as males by 10 dah, although the DMY mRNA levels at 0 dah did not differ significantly among the six tested XYwKsn individuals (data not shown). The increase in the sex-reversal ratio seen in Kesen-numa G2 suggests the possibility that autosomal loci are related to the sex reversal in addition to a reduced DMY expression level, similar to the case for the tda genes in mice (Eicher et al. 1996).The mutants with reduced DMY expression may contain regulatory mutations in the flanking region of DMY. Future experiments will be focused on identifying the DMY expression control elements. These mutants may prove valuable for identifying DMY regulatory elements that are involved in transcriptional control.We thank Yoshitaka Nagahama (Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, National Institute of Basic Biology) for his generosity in letting H.O. use his facility.

In medaka, a male-to-female reversal upon exposure to a xenoestrogen is accompanied by an increase in brain aromatase expression and activity. However, whether this increase is the direct cause of sex reversal is unknown. In this study we further examined the role brain aromatase plays in genesis of developmental abnormalities in response to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Further, the effects of a mixture of apparent antagonistic environmentally relevant EDCs on development were examined to determine if their combined actions could lessen each other’s impacts. To this end, hatchling medaka were subjected in a 2-week flow-through immersion exposure to an estrogen mimic [dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (o,p′-DDT)] and to pharmaceutical [fadrozole (FAD)] and environmental aromatase inhibitors [tributyltin (TBT)] alone and in combination. Brain aromatase expression and enzyme activity were measured on exposure days 5, 9, and 14 by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and tritiated water release assay, respectively. We recorded sex reversals at sexual maturity by examining the phenotypic and genotypic sex of d-rR–strain medaka. Results indicate that FAD and TBT inhibit aromatase activity in o,p′-DDT–treated fish but do not prevent feminization, indicating that increased brain aromatase activity is not critical to EDC-induced male-to-female sex inversion. The observation that estradiol biosynthesis inhibitors do not block the effect of the xenoestrogen suggests that in the environment, exposure to seemingly antagonistic EDCs does not necessarily lessen the harmful impacts of these compounds.Beginning early in sex determination and gonadogenesis in fish, communication between nonadjacent tissues is necessary. This communication is accomplished through the endocrine system, which controls sex differentiation through complex interactions between the central nervous system and gonads using pituitary-derived gonadotropins and sex steroids produced in the gonad and brain (Nagahama 1994). Production of these sex steroids is very strongly linked with the early steps of gonadal differentiation, and they can influence long-term sex determination choices (Devlin and Nagahama 2002). Further, it has been demonstrated that exposure to estrogen or estrogen-mimicking chemicals during a critical period of development can result in genotypic XY males developing into fully functional phenotypic females, whereas exposure of genotypic XX females to androgenic chemicals can result in development of phenotypic males (Cheek et al. 2001a, 2001b; Edmunds et al. 2000; Gronen et al. 1999; Hunter and Donaldson 1983; Yamamoto 1969).Because of the critical role of estrogen in the very early stages of sex determination and sex differentiation, the estrogen-synthesizing enzyme is of likely importance. As in all vertebrates, in fish this function is performed by cytochrome P450 aromatase, which converts androgens to estrogens and is expressed in a number of tissues, including the brain, liver, and gonads. Recently, a second isoform of aromatase (cyp19b; Genbank accession no. AY319970; National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD) has been found in the brain of several teleost species (Callard and Tchoudakova 1997; Chiang et al. 2001; Kuhl et al. 2005). This isoform has much higher activity and mRNA levels in the brain than the ovary has of ovarian aromatase (Kishida and Callard 2001).It has been hypothesized that altered expression of aromatase is important in environmentally influenced sex differentiation. Increases in brain aromatase expression occur in 0- to 14-day-posthatch (dph) medaka concomitantly with xenoestrogen-induced feminization (Kuhl et al. 2005), whereas ovarian aromatase mRNA transcripts at this life stage are not detectable. Conversely, inhibition of aromatase activity can result in masculinization of genotypic females (Piferrer et al. 1994). Whether altered aromatase activity is directly responsible for sex reversal is not known. In the present study we aimed to further examine the critical role aromatase plays in the genesis of developmental abnormalities in response to endocrine disruptors.Most research to date on the effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) has focused on abnormalities induced by exposure to a single compound. However, in the environment, humans and wildlife are exposed to diverse mixtures of androgenic, estrogenic, antiandrogenic, and antiestrogenic compounds (Bush et al. 1990). Only recently has focus begun to shift to examining the impact of mixtures of EDCs on human and wildlife populations. Most of this research, however, has focused on the synergism between several weak estrogenic compounds (Bergeron et al. 1999; Payne et al. 2000). These studies demonstrate that there is an additive effect of several weakly estrogenic EDCs. To date, little work has been done on the impacts of mixtures of antagonistic EDCs. It is unknown if an androgenic or anti-estrogenic chemical can block the activity of an estrogenic one. Here we address this question by examining if xenoestrogen [dichloro-diphenyltrichloroethane (o,p′-DDT)]-induced feminization of developing medaka can be prevented by coexposure to a pharmaceutical [fadrozole (FAD)] and an environmental aromatase inhibitor (AI), tributyltin (TBT). We hypothesize that o,p′-DDT activates the estrogen receptor to induce transcription of brain aromatase. Increased brain aromatase activity results in increased estradiol levels feminizing the development of the fish. We further hypothesize that inhibiting aromatase activity will prevent a xenoestrogen-induced surge of estradiol production and prevent feminization.o,p′-DDT is a known xenoestrogen that can negatively affect reproduction and development in fish, through immersion exposure (Cheek et al. 2001a, 2001b) and direct injection into oocytes (Edmunds et al. 2000). FAD has been used extensively in breast cancer research as a pharmaceutical inhibitor of aromatase and has been shown to be a reversible competitive inhibitor of aromatase in birds (Elbrecht and Smith 1992), mammals (Steele et al. 1987), and fish (Afonso et al. 1999, 2001). In Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), the suppression of aromatase with a FAD-treated diet resulted in a 100% male population Afonso 2001; Kwon et al. 2000). TBT has been used as an antifouling biocide in paint for boats, for wood treatment and preservation, and as a fungicide/bactericide in textile and industrial water systems (Gehring et al. 1991). At very low concentrations, TBT can disrupt the endocrine system, as evidenced by the induction of male sexual characteristics in female gastropods (Oberdorster and McClellan-Green 2002; Smith 1981). TBT has also been shown to be an EDC in fish, as well. A 30-day exposure to 100 ng/L TBT in zebrafish (Danio rerio) resulted in an almost completely male population (McAllister and Kime 2003). It is hypothesized that TBT acts as a competitive inhibitor of aromatase, which causes accumulation of testosterone and masculinization of the organism (McAllister and Kime 2003; Oberdorster and McClellan-Green 2002).Our results from the present study demonstrate that an increase in aromatase activity is not needed for EDC-induced feminization and that antiestrogenic AIs are unable to prevent xenoestrogen-induced feminization.Medaka (d-rR strain) used in this study were hatched from brood-stock cultured and maintained at the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory, University of Southern Mississippi (Ocean Springs, MS). The d-rR strain contains a Y-chromosome–linked gene coding for a red body color phenotype, allowing for the simple determination of sex genotype: males have red phenotype, and females have white. Medaka also have secondary sex characteristics that are reflective of sexual phenotype. Females have shorter anal fins, and males have a notched dorsal fin. With the d-rR strain and secondary sex characteristics (fin morphology), sex reversals can be determined by simple observation of body color and fin development. Animal care and experimentation were conducted in accordance with University of Southern Mississippi guidelines for animal care and use, and animals were treated humanely with regard for alleviation of suffering. Broodstock cultures were maintained in 300-L fiberglass runs at a 27 ± 1°C. A 16-hr light/8-hr dark photoperiod was provided by timer-controlled overhead fluorescent lights. Broodstock cultures were fed a minimum of twice daily, one feeding of commercial flake (Ziegler Brothers, Santa Anna, CA) and one feeding of brine shrimp nauplii, ad libitum.Medaka were exposed in two consecutive experiments. In the first experiment medaka were exposed to nominal concentrations of 0, 10, 50, and 100 μg/L FAD and 0.7 μg/L TBT. This was designed as a range-finding study to determine potential masculinizing concentrations of a pharmaceutical AI and determine the responsiveness of the system to an environmental AI. The second exposure consisted of nominal concentrations of 300 μg/L FAD, 1.5 μg/L TBT, 7.5 μg/L DDT, 50 μg/L FAD with 7.5 μg/L DDT, 300 μg/L FAD with 7.5 μg/L DDT, and 1.5 μg/L TBT with 7.5 μg/L DDT. DDT concentrations were selected based on levels previously shown to induce male-to-female sex inversion (Kuhl et al. 2005).Eggs were collected from 15-cm cylindrical filter sponges used as spawning substrates. Embryos were transferred to glass hatching jars containing about 4 L of hatching solution (1.00 g/L NaCl, 0.030 g/L KCl, 0.040 g/L CaCl2, 0.162 g/L MgSO4 in distilled water) with the salinity of the hatching solution brought to 5 g/L with NaCl to control fungus. Hatching jars were maintained under continuous fluorescent light in a water bath at 24 ± 1°C and vigorously aerated to suspend embryos.At hatch, 75 d-rR fry were housed in three retention chambers (100-mm Petri dish bottoms with attached 475-μm nylon collar) with 25 fish in each chamber. For the first exposure, fry were exposed to four duplicated exposure treatments (control, three FAD concentrations, and one TBT concentration) for a total of 8 test aquaria. For the second exposure, fry were exposed to seven duplicated exposure treatments (control, carrier control, FAD, two FAD + DDT combinations, TBT, and TBT + DDT) for a total of 14 test aquaria. Test aquaria were 35 L with a water depth of 19 cm maintained by drain siphon. Test aquaria were housed within a central water bath kept at 27 ± 1°C and provided with a 16-hr light/8-hr dark photoperiod supplied by fluorescent bulbs.Exposure was conducted in a setup similar to that described by Walker et al. (1985) and Manning et al. (1999). Briefly, a water partitioner delivered 2 L of test solution each cycle to splitter/mixing boxes that dispensed 1 L to each duplicate aquarium. The exposure system cycled between three and five cycles per hour during the exposure period. Test concentrations were prepared each cycle by injection of appropriate stock to the splitter boxes of each treatment using Hamilton PSD2 liquid injectors (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV). Stocks were created by dissolving the compound in the appropriate solvent. DDT and TBT were dissolved in triethylene glycol, and FAD was dissolved in well water.Water quality (pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen) was measured twice each week, and water samples were removed four times (day 0, 5, 8, and 14) for analytical analysis of the test chemicals. Survival was monitored and recorded daily, and all dead fry were removed. Six fish per aquaria (12/treatment) were sampled, weighed, and archived for molecular analysis on days 5, 9, and 14. Six sampled fish per treatment were preserved in 200 μL RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX) for mRNA analysis, and six were preserved in 200 μL phosphate buffer (100 mM KCl, 10 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) for enzyme activity analysis. Upon exposure completion, fry were transferred to 18.5-L grow-out aquaria until sexual maturity so secondary sex characteristics could be observed. After sex determination, fish were terminally anesthetized with MS-222 and discarded.Ovarian (cyp19a) and brain aromatase (cyp19b) expression was measured using real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Due to lack of detection of ovarian aromatase with real-time PCR, further examination of cyp19a was performed using multiple primer pair with visualization of expression using both real-time methods and 2% agarose gel/ethidium bromide. Total RNA was extracted from whole fry using a Trizol procedure and purified with a phenol: chloroform extraction followed by an ethanol precipitation. Total RNA concentration was measured using a Beckman (Fullerton, CA) DU640 spectrophotometer and treated with DNase H (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to remove genomic DNA contamination. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg total RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase from Invitrogen and random decamers. Real-time PCR was accomplished using Taqman chemistry (Heid et al. 1996).Forward and reverse primers for cyp19a and cyp19b amplification and dual dye-labeled FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein; excitation, 490 nm; emission, 520 nm)–Black Hole Quencher (BHQ) were designed from the ovarian and brain aromatase sequence (Genebank accession nos. D82968 and AY319970) using Beacon Designer 3.01 (PREMIER Biosoftware, Palo Alto, CA) (oligo 1–7) (Table 1). 18S primers designed from published medaka 18S sequence and Cy5 (excitation, 596 nm; emission, 615 nm)–Iowa Black RQ dual-labeled Taqman probes (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) were used as internal normalization standard (oligo 8, 9, 10) (Table 1). Integrated DNA Technologies supplied probes, and we used a Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) IQ-Cycler real-time PCR system to amplify and measure fluorescence of aromatase and 18S. For the reactions in the first exposure, conditions consisted of 100 nM probe, 900 nM primer for aromatase, and 100 nM probe and 50 nM primers for 18S for all sampling days. Primer concentrations were tested to ensure equal amplification efficiency between aromatase and 18S.Due to differences in the ratio of 18S and aromatase concentrations in fish collected at each sample period in the second exposure, we used different concentrations of probe and primers to obtain equal amplification efficiencies. Day 5 conditions consisted of 100 nM probe, 1,200 nM primer for aromatase, and 100 nM probe and 35 nM primers for 18S. Day 9 conditions were 100 nM probe, 1,200 nM primer for aromatase, and 100 nM probe and 40 nM primers for 18S. On day 14, no primer concentrations could be determined that would express both aromatase and 18S for all samples in multiplex with equal amplification efficiency. Therefore, day 14 samples were measured in separate single-plex reactions using Bio-Rad IQ Real-Time SYBRMix with SYBRGreen. Multiplex reactions used Bio-Rad IQ Real-Time Supermix according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cycle parameters were 50°C for 120 sec, 95°C for 120 sec, 50 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, and 61°C for 30 sec. Relative expression was calculated with the comparative Ct (Δ ΔCt) method, which involves comparing the thresh-old cycle (Ct) values of the treated samples with the nontreated controls (calibrator). The Ct values of both the calibrator and the treated samples are then normalized to the endogenous housekeeping gene 18S. Gene expression for each sampling time is expressed as fold increase over same-day control.Aromatase activity was measured by a tritiated water release assay based on the work of Thompson and Siiteri (1974) as adapted to medaka by Melo and Ramsdell (2001) and Contractor et al. (2004). Whole medaka fry sampled during exposure were homogenized in phosphate buffer (1 M KCl, 0.01 M K2HPO4, and 0.001 M EDTA, pH 7.4). Protein concentration of homogenate was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Homogenate containing about 20 mg of protein was incubated with 5 nM androst-4-ene-3,17-dione [1β-3H(N)] (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA) in a 200 μL solution of 1 mM NADPH, 10 mM glucose-6-phosphate, 1 U/mL glucose-6-dehydrogenase, 10 mM potassium phosphate (dibasic), 1,000 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol at 37°C for 3 hr. After incubation, reactions were terminated by immersion in ice-cold water and adding 100 μL 30% trichloroacetic acid, and centrifuged at 1,700g for 10 min to remove precipitated protein. Unconverted substrate was removed by vortexing vigorously for 60 sec with 1 mL chloroform followed by centrifugation at 1,700g for 25 min at 4°C. Addition of a 5% charcoal/0.5% dextran slurry followed by a 40 sec vortex and 30 min centrifugation (10,000g) was used to remove any residual androst-4-ene-3,17-dione. Radioactivity of tritiated water was measured in a Beckman LS6500 liquid scintillation counter and background subtracted using samples without homogenate. Sensitivity of detection was set at two standard deviations above the mean blank activity to be considered detectable.Magnolia Scientific Services Inc. (Hattiesburg, MS) measured o,p′-DDT and TBT. o,p′-DDT was measured according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) method 608 (U.S. EPA 1988), and TBT was measured according to U.S. EPA method 282.3 (U.S. EPA 1989).We determined FAD concentration using reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with photo diode array detection. Water samples (~ 5 mL) were collected twice weekly in glass vials and injected directly as 1.0 mL aliquots onto a 4.6 mm × 25 cm Beckman Ultrasphere C18 reverse-phase column connected to a Beckman Gold HPLC system. Samples were chromatographed using a gradient program with a mobile phase starting at 60% methanol/40% 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) for 4 min and increased to 80% methanol/20% buffer over 2 min, where it was held for 9 min. Mobile phase was then returned to 60% methanol/20% phosphate buffer to prepare the column for the next sample. FAD in column eluate was detected using a Beckman System Gold 168 photodiode array detector set at 229 nm. A five-point standard curve was developed with FAD dissolved in well water for sample quantification. Samples were measured in duplicate in conjunction with standards. Limit of detection was approximately 5 μg/L.We compared treatments and controls for percent survival with the chi-square test after transformation of percentages by the arcsine square root procedure. Deviations from a 1:1 sex ratio were analyzed by the replicated goodness-of-fit test (G-test) followed by the unplanned test of the homogeneity of replicates. In treatments were no males remained after exposure, we added 0.05 to values for all males and females for all treatments so that the natural logarithm could be calculated. Throughout all experiments, each fish was treated as a replicate for both aromatase activity and cyp19b expression (n = 6) because space for individual experimental units was limited. We compared cyp19b expression and aromatase activity among treatments by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A Kolmogorov-Smirnov one-sample test was used to test for normality, and Levine’s test was used to test for homogeneity of variance. If data failed either test, the we used the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA to examine differences. If significant difference among groups was observed, a Dunn’s multiple comparisons test on each day separately was used to determine where significance occurred. Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. All statistical analyses and graphing were completed using Sigmastat 3.1 (Systat Software, Inc., Point Richmond, CA) and SPSS 11.5 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).In the first exposure, juvenile medaka were exposed in a flow-through system to FAD and TBT for 2 weeks beginning at hatch. Measured concentrations of the test chemicals were approximately 90–141% of nominal concentrations. Survival ranged from 51 to 63%, and according to the goodness-of-fit chi-square test, no significant difference in survival between controls and exposed groups existed (Table 2). Developmental exposure to FAD and TBT did not significantly alter adult sex ratios at concentrations chosen. In d-rR medaka, white males and red females indicate a phenotypic sex inversion. At this exposure, there were no sex inversions as evidenced by the lack of any white males or red females (Table 3).In the second exposure, medaka were exposed to FAD, TBT, and o,p′-DDT for 2 weeks beginning at hatch. Measured doses ranged between 81 and 101% of nominal concentrations. Survival ranged from 39 to 50%, and there was no significant difference in survival between controls and exposed groups (Table 4). According to a goodness-of-fit G-test, developmental exposure to FAD and TBT did not alter sex distributions or induce sex inversion. However, o,p′-DDT significantly altered sex distributions in all o,p′-DDT exposures regardless of inhibitor cotreatment (Table 5).Gene expression was measured in individual whole fry on days 5, 9, and 14 for each treatment and quantitated using the Δ ΔCt method. 18S was used as the internal normalization standard, and expression data for each time point are expressed as fold change relative to the mean of the same-day controls. Ovarian aromatase was not detected in any sample through measurement with real-time PCR or traditional PCR. Further multiple primer sets were tested in multiple conditions (data not shown). Therefore, all following data represent brain aromatase expression.In the first exposure, day 9 samples were lost because of defective extraction reagent. A Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA demonstrated that brain aromatase expression levels showed a significant decrease in the TBT treatment versus control treatment at sampling day 5 (Figure 1). However, this significance was lost by sampling day 14 (data not shown).In the second exposure, the day 14 sampling period demonstrated a significant difference in cyp19b expression between treatments according to a Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA. Pairwise multiple comparisons between treatments revealed that this difference is between FAD- and TBT-only treatments and DDT only (Dunn’s method, p < 0.05). Fish exposed to FAD- and TBT-only treatments also had lower expression levels than those exposed to the AI and o,p′-DDT cotreatments; however, these differences are not significant (Figure 2). Day 5 and day 9 sampling periods show similar trends but are not significant (results not shown).Aromatase activity was measured using a tritiated water release assay. In the first exposure, assay sensitivity was 1.49, 1.20, and 0.86 fmol/hr/mg protein for sampling days 5, 9, and 14, respectively. The highest concentration of FAD and TBT treatment levels consistently resulted in aromatase activity levels below level of sensitivity for this assay and can be considered non-detectable (Figure 3).In the first experiment, changes in activity followed the same pattern as changes in gene expression on all sampling days, with decreasing activity at increasing concentrations of FAD and in the TBT treatment. Although day 5 and day 9 showed no significant difference between any treatments (results not shown), day 14 showed a significant decrease in activity between the controls and the highest concentrations of FAD and TBT (Figure 3).For the second exposure, the limit of detection (LOD) was 2.30, 1.37, and 0.26 fmol/hr/mg protein for days 5, 9, and 14, respectively. Only the control treatment had measurable levels of aromatase activity on day 5, and all day 9 samples were < LOD. On day 14, only the o,p′-DDT/high FAD and o,p′-DDT/TBT cotreatments had enzyme activity levels below assay sensitivity (Figure 4).Aromatase activity demonstrated a pattern different from aromatase expression. Unlike cyp19b expression data, which showed an increase in aromatase expression in all o,p′-DDT treatments regardless of presence of inhibitors, aromatase activity showed an increase only in the o,p′-DDT control treatment (Figure 4). A Kruskal-Wallis test demonstrated a significant difference in aromatase activity between treatments on day 14. Pairwise multiple comparison procedure revealed that the o,p′-DDT–only treatment is significantly different from all other treatments. The cotreatments of o,p′-DDT and AIs had reduced or nondetectable aromatase activity with no corresponding decrease in aromatase gene expression. However, this decrease in activity was not significant. This trend was not observed on sampling day 5 or day 9 (results not shown).Most laboratory research to date on EDCs has focused on the effects of a single compound on an organism. However, in the environment, organisms are exposed to complex mixtures of potentially synergistic and antagonistic compounds, and it is unknown how these chemicals interact in vivo and whether such interactions diminish or exacerbate their individual effects on the health of the organism. To begin addressing these questions, our objectives in the present study were 2-fold: to examine the role of brain aromatase in o,p′-DDT–induced sex reversal in medaka and to determine if an environmentally relevant mixture of both estrogenic (o,p′-DDT) and apparent antiestrogenic (TBT) chemicals, which have opposing effects on aromatase activity, can block each other’s effects on reproductive development. Extensive experiments showed that ovarian aromatase transcripts could not be detected in medaka fry (0–14 dph) by real-time or traditional RT-PCR. Further, ovarian aromatase could not be detected upon stimulation of the estrogen response system after exposure to estradiol and o,p′-DDT. It appears, therefore, that the brain isoform of aromatase accounts for most, if not all, estradiol production during this life stage of the medaka and that the aromatase activity measured in this study represents the brain form of this enzyme.To accomplish our stated objectives, we exposed juvenile medaka to an environmental estrogen in the presence and absence of two AIs and examined the effects on aromatase expression and activity and sex reversal. After a 2-week exposure, all fish developed female secondary sex characteristics regardless of the presence of AIs and independent of levels of brain aromatase activity, indicating that an increase in brain aromatase activity, as observed with o,p′-DDT exposure only, is not required for a male-to-female sex reversal resulting from exposure to an environmental estrogen. The results of the study presented here also show that the effects (feminization) of an environmental estrogen (o,p′-DDT) are not negated by the antagonistic effects of an environmental antiestrogen (TBT) at the exposure conditions and developmental stage examined. Whether the results of this specific case are of general validity for mixtures with predicted antagonistic effects deserves further study.Additionally, results from this study demonstrate that immersion exposure to AIs alone did not result in any female-to-male inversions, even though aromatase activity was inhibited. These results contrast with several published studies in which inhibition of aromatase by both pharmaceutical (FAD) and environmental (TBT) AI exposure (McAllister and Kime 2003; Uchida et al. 2004) can result in masculinization of several fish species, including Japanese flounder, zebrafish, and salmon (Kitano et al. 2000; Kwon et al. 2000; Piferrer et al. 1993; Uchida et al. 2004). Masculinization occurs concomitantly with a decrease in aromatase expression, suggesting that manipulation of the aromatase system during development can alter gonadal differentiation (Fenske and Segner 2004).These studies on the role of aromatase in sex reversal during development support the theory that androgens and estrogens are the natural sex inducers in fish and play pivotal roles in sex differentiation (Devlin and Nagahama 2002). Other evidence such as sexually dimorphic expression of aromatase in developing zebrafish (Trant et al. 2001) and the ability of exogenous steroid treatment to influence sex differentiation (Yamamoto 1958) suggest the importance of sex steroid production in the very early steps in gonad differentiation. Also, in medaka, inhibition of aromatase can result in the prevention of ovarian cavity formation, suggesting the importance of endogenous estrogen in gonadal development (Suzuki et al. 2004).However, other evidence exists that suggests sex steroids may not play such an important role. For example, in medaka, germ cell differentiation appears to occur before somatic steroid-producing cells are observed (Satoh 1974). Further, in a study by Kawahara and Yamashita (2000), medaka eggs incubated with an AI resulted in no abnormal sex ratios. From these observations, the authors concluded that female sex determination in medaka is not estrogen dependent. They also suggested that estrogen-independent activation of the estrogen receptor may be a primary pathway in female gonadal development. They emphasized that the observations of female-to-male sex inversion after treatment with AI in other vertebrates and fish suggests a role of aromatase only during the sex determination period and not the importance of estrogen and aromatase as the natural sex inducer in gonadal differentiation.In the present study, exposure to AIs significantly reduced aromatase activity between days 9 and 14 yet did not induce a sex inversion. This could be because male sex differentiation is irreversibly determined before day 9. However, it is more likely that our treatment period terminated too early, because male germ cell proliferation does not occur until 14 dph (Satoh 1974). Sensitivity of sex differentiation to endocrine disruptors has been shown to be dependent on duration and dose of exposure and on developmental stage. Insufficient exposure length or dosage concentrations can result in lack of response (Cheek et al. 2001b). The lack of response to aromatase inhibition reported by Kawahara and Yamashita (2000) may therefore be due to the developmental period of exposure. In most cases, the most sensitive period is just before or at the same time as histologic differentiation of the primitive gonad (Hunter and Donaldson 1983). In medaka, differentiation occurs at hatch, with the proliferation of ovarian cells beginning shortly after hatch (about 6–10 dph) (Satoh 1974). Medaka have been shown to be sensitive to feminization by estradiol during this proliferation period (Cheek et al. 2001a; Nimrod and Benson 1998). Unlike female germ cells, male germ cells cease to divide immediately after hatching, and proliferation is delayed until about the 9–10 mm larval stage (about 14–20 dph) (Satoh 1974). This is also the stage of development in which male gonial cells first appear in the female gonad upon androgen treatment (Kobayashi and Hishida 1985). Thus, lack of masculinization in response to aromatase inhibition observed in this study might be due to termination of exposure before male germ cell proliferation begins.In the present study, the inhibition of aromatase did not induce a female-to-male inversion, i nor did it prevent a male-to-female inversion induced by o,p′-DDT. Several studies have demonstrated a correlation between an increase in aromatase expression and activity upon exposure to environmental estrogens and sex differentiation in fish (Chiang et al. 2001; Fenske and Senger 2004;Kitano et al. 2000; Scholz and Gutzeit 2000; Tanaka et al. 1995). Previous work in this laboratory (Kuhl et al. 2005) also demonstrated the importance of the aromatase system in fish gonadal development by observing a significant 5-fold increases in aromatase expression and activity at o,p′-DDT concentrations that induce a male-to-female sex inversion.Results from the present study, however, demonstrate that sex inversion can be induced without a corresponding increase in aromatase activity. Treatment with o,p′-DDT alone induces both aromatase activity and brain aromatase expression, while resulting in a complete male-to-female sex inversion. However, inhibition of aromatase activity in o,p′-DDT/AI–cotreated fish also results in a complete male-to-female sex inversion. In these fish, there is an increase in brain aromatase expression while activity is reduced to nondetectable levels. Altered aromatase activity levels are therefore not a requirement for sex inversion in fish.The apparent lack of aromatase involvement suggests that alternative, non-aromatase-dependent pathways exist through which o,p′-DDT may bring about sex reversal. For example, exogenous estrogen treatment can also result in reduction of expression of several steroidogenic enzymes, including P450c17, 3βHSD, and P45011β in the differentiating testis (Govoroun et al. 2001). This would decrease the synthesis of 11-oxygenated androgen and may be an important step in exogenous estrogen feminization. Further, xenobiotics can induce steroid-metabolizing enzymes, including steroid sulfotransferases, steroid glucuronidation enzymes, and steroid hydroxylases (You 2004). Because the ratio of androgens to estrogens may be more important in differentiating gonads than their absolute values (Bogart 1987), xenobiotic alterations of androgen levels may also play a role in the cotreatments conducted in this study. Steroidogenic enzyme levels and androgen to estrogen ratios during cotreatments must be measured to examine the possibility of this mechanism. Finally, non-genomic actions mediated through membrane-bound hormone receptors also can influence steroid production. Loomis and Thomas (2000) demonstrated that estrogens, and likely xenoestrogens including o,p′-DDT, can cause a decrease in gonadotropin-stimulated androgen production through a nongenomic mechanism in the Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). This may further interfere with steroid production and the ratios between androgens and estrogens.In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that the xenoestrogen o,p′-DDT increases brain aromatase activity accompanied by complete male-to-female sex inversion. Coexposure to o,p′-DDT and AIs does suppress aromatase activity but does not prevent sex reversal. Thus, increased aromatase activity is not necessary for sex inversion, and alternatively, aromatase-independent pathways for sex reversal resulting from xenobiotic treatment must exist. This study shows that exposure to AIs during days 0–14 fails to induce female-to-male sex inversion. This suggests that testis differentiation in d-rR medaka does not occur until after 14 dph. The observation that exposure to a mixture of estrogenic and antiestrogenic compounds does not block estrogen-induced sex reversal suggests that, in the environment, exposure to antagonistic EDCs may not necessarily lessen the harmful impacts of these compounds.Figure 1 Effects of FAD and TBT on brain aromatase expression on day 5 shown as fold change relative to same-day control as measured by real-time PCR (mean ± SE).*Significant difference (p < 0.05).Figure 2 Effects of FAD, TBT, and o,p′-DDT, as well as FAD/DDT and TBT/DDT coexposure, on brain aromatase expression on day 14 shown as fold change (± SE) relative to same-day control as measured by real-time PCR.

Learn about our remote access optionsUsing the S‐rR strain of the medaka Oryzias latipes, we examined the effect of a non‐aromatizable androgen on sex determination. Intrafollicular immature oocytes isolated before breakdown of the germinal vesicle were incubated in the presence of 17α‐methyldihydrotestosterone (MDHT) for about 10 h during their maturational period. At the end of incubation, mature oocytes were rinsed and then artificially inseminated in regular saline. The fertilized eggs were then allowed to develop in tap water, and the fry were reared on a regular powdered diet until adulthood. Sex reversal of female to male was observed in a manner dependent on the dose of MDHT. In the solvent control group in which intrafollicular oocytes were matured in medium containing no exogenous androgen, no sex reversal was observed. The present finding, that the sex of medakas can be reversed by a single in vitro exposure of immature oocytes to androgen during the preovulatory period, suggests the existence in the oocyte of a sex determinant sensitive to sex steroids. This method for controlling the sex of eggs before fertilization may establish sex‐determined eggs as potent material for investigating the mechanism of sex determination in the medaka.Ovarian sex steroid hormones are generally known to be secreted by ovarian follicles in response to the stimulation of pituitary gonadotropins. Promotion of oocyte growth and vitellogenesis by estrogens is mediated by the liver during oogenesis in non‐mammals (van Bohemen et al. 1981; Nagahama 1994). Sex differentiation is considered to be under genetic control, which is affected by various environmental factors such as sex steroid hormones and temperature (Baroiller et al. 1999; Conover & Fleisher 1986; George & Wilson 1994; Strüssman et al. 1996, 1997). Among gonochoristic teleosts, the medaka is a sex‐differentiated gonochorist, the sexuality of which is stable throughout life (Yamamoto 1953). The genus Oryzias has an XX‐XY sex determination mechanism (Kondo et al. 2001; Hamaguchi et al. 2004) similar to that found in mammals. Complete sex reversal in both directions has been demonstrated in the medaka for the first time by oral administration of heterogeneous sex steroid hormones during the critical period of gonadal sex differentiation (Yamamoto 1953, 1958). Yamamoto (1962, 1969) postulated that estrogen can act as a gyno‐inducer and androgen can act as an andro‐inducer for sex differentiation. In many species of gonochoristic fish, successful induction of sex‐reversal has been accomplished by proper treatment with sex steroids with adequate timing, dosage and mode of administration prior to or early in gonadal differentiation (Schreck 1974; Reinboth 1983; Piferrer & Donaldson 1991; Nakamura et al. 1998; Piferrer 2001).The sex steroid treatment for induction of sex reversal is effective during a critical period of gonadal sex differentiation (Adkins‐Regan 1987; Piferrer 2001). If sex steroids act as inducers for gonadal sex differentiation, their endogenous production must be required shortly before or during this process. There is histochemical (Oncorhynchus mykiss, van den Hurk et al. 1982) and ultrastructural (Oncorhynchus rhodium, Nakamura & Nagahama 1993; Anguilla japonica, Chiba et al. 1997) evidence supporting the presence of steroidogenic enzymes and steroid‐producing cells at or just after gonadal differentiation. In some fishes, these cells express the steroidogenic enzymes required for biosynthesis of estradiol‐17β(E2) from cholesterol in presumptive ovaries at the undifferentiated stage and in differentiating ovaries (Nakamura et al. 1998; Suzuki et al. 2004). Gigue et al. (1999) demonstrated aromatase gene expression before differentiation of indifferent female gonads, but not of indifferent male gonads in the rainbow trout (O. mykiss). Based upon the finding of aromatase in undifferentiated and differentiated ovaries, it was suggested that endogenous estrogens act as the natural inducers of ovarian differentiation in the tilapia. According to Matsuda (2003), androgens in the medaka Oryzias latipes, might upregulate dsx and mab‐3‐related transcription factor 1 (dmrt1), which might subsequently promote testicular differentiation with the synergistic action of a factor in the germ line (figα, Scholz et al. 2003) after hatching. However, it has still not been conclusively determined whether or not sex steroid hormones are natural inducers for sex differentiation in the medaka, because the action site and mechanism of sex steroid hormones in the sex differentiation cascade remain to be verified at the molecular level.The aim of the present study is to ascertain whether or not sex steroids exert their action on determination of genotypic sexes before fertilization, which is different from the actions involved in gonadal sex differentiation, although sex determination and differentiation may be inseparable (Harington 1974). In the experiment we incubated immature oocytes at the germinal vesicle stage in the presence of a non‐aromatizable androgen during the preovulatory period, and reared embryos and fry in the absence of any exogenous sex steroids from fertilization until sexual maturation. Our results revealed that in vitro exposure of immature oocytes to an exogenous androgen during only the preovulatory period can clearly bring about complete sex reversal of genotypic females to phenotypic males.Adult O. latipes medakas, of the S‐rR strain (XrXr, XrYR) bred in our laboratory were used in the present study. In this strain, body color is a genetic marker for sex, orange‐red in males (XrYR) and white in females (XrXr). The fish were the descendants of stock that was originally bred by Hagino et al. (Sumika Technoservice K.) in 1999 from the orange‐red variety of O. latipes (Hagino et al. 2001) and reared thereafter at the Laboratory of Biology, Asahi University. Fish were maintained under artificially controlled reproductive conditions (light 14 h, dark 10 h; 26–28°C) which caused females to spawn around 6:00 hours every morning. In medakas maintained under these conditions, the sequence of events leading to spawning, such as vitellogenesis, oocyte maturation and ovulation, can be timed accurately (Iwamatsu 1978). This fish releases the pituitary hormone that induces oocyte maturation 3–10 h after the onset of light, and ovulates mature oocytes daily about 1 h before the onset of light. After the brains of females were pithed, their ovaries were removed from their body cavities by a routine procedure 9 h before the expected ovulation time, and were placed into a saline solution (111.2 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.1 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mm MgSO4, pH adjusted to 7.3 with M/2 NaHCO3Iwamatsu 1973).Intrafollicular (intact follicle cell‐enclosed) oocytes (950–100 µm in diameter), about 3 h before breakdown of the germinal vesicle (GVBD; about 9 h before the presumptive ovulation time), were isolated in saline by dissecting the ovaries with fine forceps. Immediately after isolation, oocytes were transferred into culture medium (90% Earle's Medium 199, Dainippon‐seiyaku, Osaka, Japan) supplemented with 30 IU/mL penicillin‐GK and 60 µg/mL streptomycin (Meijiseika, Tokyo, Japan) and filtered using a MiIlex‐HV Filter Unit (pore size 0.45 µm, Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Isolated intrafollicular oocytes (30) were incubated for about 10 h in 3 mL of culture medium (27°C) in a sterile polystyrene dish (3 mm Tissue Culture Dish, Corning, Corning, NY, USA). At the time these oocytes were isolated, gonadotropin had already been secreted from the pituitary gland (Iwamatsu 1978). Therefore, it was not necessary to add exogenous gonadotropin and maturation‐inducing steroids (MIS) to the culture medium, since follicle cells already stimulated by endogenous gonadotropin gradually produce and secrete MIS, which in turn induces oocyte maturation.The non‐aromatizable androgen, 17α‐methyldihydrotestosterone (MDHT), was purchased from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO, USA), dissolved at 1 mg/mL in ethanol as a stock solution, and diluted to final concentrations of 1–100 ng/mL in culture medium just before use in each experiment. In the solvent control group, intrafollicular oocytes were incubated in culture medium containing 0.01% ethanol without any exogenous sex steroid hormones.After they were rinsed in saline at the end of incubation, mature oocytes (eggs) were inseminated in a sperm suspension that was prepared by dissecting a few testes from mature males (XrYR or sex‐reversed XrXr) in saline. Some oocytes that were still covered with follicle cell layers were inseminated after the layers were mechanically removed using fine forceps under a dissecting microscope (×20). Fertilized eggs were incubated in tap water, and after hatching, the fry were reared on a regular powdered diet in a plastic rat cage (44 cm × 27 cm × 19 cm; KN‐601 PC‐cage) until sexual maturation about two months posthatching.To test ascertain reproductive function, some of the sex‐reversed XX males were mated with normal females of the S‐rR strain, and their genotypes were confirmed by checking the gonadal sex and body color of the offspring obtained.Intrafollicular oocytes were incubated for about 10 h in the absence or the presence of MDHT at 1–100 ng/mL. Oocytes that underwent maturational responses such as GVBD and ovulation at the end of incubation were artificially inseminated after they were rinsed twice in regular saline. In order to ascertain induction of paradoxical sex reversal, spermatozoa of normal orange‐red males (XrYR) were used for insemination only in a group treated with 100 ng/mL MDHT. For examination of the one‐way sex reversal of genotypic females to males in groups treated with 1 and 10 ng/mL MDHT, eggs (XrXr) fertilized by spermatozoa of sex‐reversed males (XrXr) were used. About 80% of these oocytes exhibited cortical reaction upon insemination and started to develop normally (Table 1).When oocytes were exposed to MDHT at 1–100 ng/mL during the maturation period, fry grew to adults about two months post hatching. In these experimental groups, 58–94% of adults with a white body color (r) proved to be functionally normal males (Table 1). The incidence of the sex‐reversed white males was a dose‐dependent. Even in the group treated with 100 ng/mL MDHT, paradoxical sex reversal (induction of orange‐red, XrYR, females) could not be detected. In the solvent control group in which oocytes were incubated in the absence of sex steroid hormones during oocyte maturation, no sex‐reversed individuals were observed.In order to determine genotypic types, five of the white (r) males sex‐reversed by 100 ng/mL MDHT were mated with normal white genotypic females (XrXr). The offspring (242) were all females, indicating that the white sex‐reversed males were genotypic females (XrXr), as summarized in Table 2.In the present study using medaka fish, we found for the first time that in vitro treatment of immature oocytes with a non‐aromatizable androgen (MDHT) during just the preovulatory maturation period was sufficient to induce the complete sex‐reversal of genotypic females to functional males. The content of maternal sex steroids in fertilized medaka eggs falls precipitously to a very low level within 2 days post fertilization (Iwamatsu et al. 2000, 2005, 2006), as also reported for eggs of the tilapia (Rothbard et al. 1987), the coho salmon (Feist et al. 1990) and arctic charr (Khan et al. 1997). There is further evidence for a role of the embryo in the metabolic degradation (and excretion) of the steroids (Khan et al. 1997). In the steelhead trout, it has been also suggested that endogenous steroid is active during the early stages of embryo development (Yeoh et al. 1996), as shown in our experimental study on production from exogenous androgens in developing embryos (lwamatsu et al. 2006). Moreover, Antila (1984) suggested that egg yolk might not act as a reservoir of lipid soluble sex steroids. Inferring from these points, exogenous non‐aromatizable androgen incorporated into medaka oocytes during in vitro incubation probably disperses rapidly from eggs into the surrounding medium at and after fertilization. Even if the incorporated MDTH remains in egg yolk that is completely consumed within several days posthatching, its concentration (1 ng/mL) must be too low to induce sex reversal by acting continuously during sex differentiation for several weeks (see Yamamoto 1969; Piferrer et al. 1993). If so, the present result implies that MDHT must determine male sex during the restricted oocyte maturation period, or at least within 2 days after fertilization, judging from the content of maternal sex steroids at a very low level in developing embryos. By mating them with normal white females (XX), MDHT‐induced white males were proved to be sex‐reversed XX males which produced all female progeny. This probably suggests the existence of a sex determinant (SD) sensitive or labile to androgen (sex steroid hormones) in the oocyte, since the androgen‐treated oocytes (XX) developed to males even in the absence of any exogenous androgen post maturation. In O. latipes and Oryzias curvinotus, sex seems to be determined by the action of a male‐determining gene such as DMY/dmrtlbY that begins to be expressed as an upstream regulatory sex‐determining factor (Matsuda 2003; Matsuda et al. 2002, 2003; Nanda et al. 2002; Scholz et al. 2003; Schartl 2004) on the Y chromosome after fertilization. The presumed SD is considered to be involved in sex determination in close association with the action of the male‐determining gene, that functions as a switch to change the expression of a genetic cascade for ovarian or testicular differentiation. However, we have few explanations as to why the egg is predestined to develop into a female upon fertilization under natural conditions unless the male‐determining gene is active. Under natural in vivo conditions, oocytes can be affected by maternal estrogens at comparatively high concentrations during oogenesis (Sakai et al. 1987; Iwamatsu et al. 2005). Eggs are most likely to be predestined to develop to females by the maternal E2‐affected SD before ovulation and finally determined by a combination of sex chromosomes provided by the spermatozoon bearing an X or Y chromosome at the time of fertilization. Our postulation on the SD for sex determination in the medaka might provide a clue to understand the relationship between sex‐determining genes and sex steroid hormones in the mechanisms of natural sex determination.Viewed from a methodological viewpoint, the present study in the medaka reveals the important fact that we can artificially manipulate the sexes of eggs before fertilization by applying an efficacious concentration of sex steroid hormones for a proper duration for the treatment in vitro of immature medaka oocytes. In the present experiment, we used intrafollicular oocytes already stimulated by gonadotropin in vivo. If younger oocytes were adequately treated in vitro with sex steroid hormones in the presence of gonadotropin for 20 h or more, as shown in previous studies (Iwamatsu 1978, 1980; Iwamatsu & Ohta 1981), the sex of mature oocytes would be perfectly controlled. One is capable of tracing the morphological and molecular processes of determination or differentiation of the planned sex from the step of fertilization, using sex‐determinate eggs. This method for controlling sex as one desires will have a great deal of potential for use in investigating the processes or mechanism of sex determination in the medaka.Volume48, Issue1January 2006Pages 59-64To induce sex reversal of male to female, freshly-fertilized eggs of the S-rR strain medaka (Oryzias latipes) were immersed in saline containing estradiol-17β (E2) in different concentrations for various durations until hatching. Results of the present experiment showed that the immersion duration in 1 μg/ml E2 to induce 100% reversal of sex differentiation in the genotypic males was enough only for one day (24 hr) post-fertilization (dpf) and that treatment with E2 for 1 dpf resulted in a dose-dependent manner with the maximum sex reversal of 100% at 1 μg/ml. To ascertain early developmental periods efficacious for inducing sex reversal, additional brief immersion treatments of eggs with E2 were further performed individually for four different early developmental periods (Stages 4–9, 10–12, 13–15 and 16–18) within 1 dpf. As a result, induction of sex reversal was observed in all these short immersion periods without any restricted efficacy. Between both experimental and control groups treated with or without E2 for 1 dpf, differences in the number of germ cells in a gonad were compared in newly-hatched fry. It was found that gonads of the genotypic males (XY) treated with E2 revealed the female type which contained many germ cells with much dividing activity. These data suggest that a possible switch mechanism that exogenous E2 could trigger to change the genetic cascades involved in sex determination upon fertilization exists in early developmental stages.Medaka, Oryzias latipes, has a firm XX-XY sex-determining system with the sex-determining gene, DMY, on the Y chromosome. However, previous studies have suggested that high water temperature might affect sex determination in Medaka. In the present study, the influence of high water temperature on sex reversal was examined. Fertilized eggs of two inbred strains of Medaka were developed at high water temperature (32°C) until hatching. The hatched fry were kept at normal water temperatures (27°C) until adulthood, and the phenotypic and genotypic sex was examined. As a result, 24% (N=105) and 50% (N=36) of XX fish developed a male phenotype in the Hd-rR and HNI inbred strains, respectively. These XX sex-reversed males had a normal testis and were fully fertile. On the other hand, all XY fish were male in the both strains. These results demonstrate that high water temperatures can induce XX sex reversal and that elevated water temperatures during the embryonic stage is a simple and useful method for getting XX males in Medaka.To understand the effect of testosterone on sex differentiation, the quantities of testosterone (T) and estradiol-17β (E2) in developing eggs of medaka (Oryzias latipes) were measured by radioimmunoassay, and the influence on sex differentiation of treating embryos with exogenous androgens was also examined. Endogenous T of eggs dispersed into the environmental water at spawning, and precipitously declined to a minimum level during incubation for 2 days post-fertilization (dpf). It did not significantly increase during development. The E2 content of fertilized eggs increased when eggs were incubated in medium containing exogenous T at the concentrations of 100 and 500 ng/ml, but not in low concentrations of 10 ng/ml or less. The presence of 500 ng/ml 17α-methyltestosterone (MT) in the incubation medium also induced an increase in the E2 content of embryos. Exposure of embryos to exogenous 1 ng/ml T that corresponded with the level of T in eggs shortly after fertilization was enough to induce sex reversal of genotypic females to functional males. The co-existence of T and aromatase inhibitor in incubation medium inhibited not only the T-induced increase in the embryonic E2 content, but also the estrogenic effect of T in causing the paradoxical sex reversal from genotypic males to phenotypic females. However, treatment of embryos with the non-aromatizable androgen, 17α-methyldihydrotestosterone, induced no detectable increase in the E2 content of embryos, but still brought about sex reversal of genotypic males into females. This contradictory result suggests that the conversion of androgens to E2 may not always be the cause for induction of paradoxical sex reversal by T treatment. Consequently, these results on sex reversal induced by treatment of embryos with exogenous androgens suggest that endogenous T of developing medaka embryos may not act as the natural andro-inducer, and that genotypic sex can be modified by exogenous sex steroids at early developmental stages long before gonadal differentiation in the medaka.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

The present study aimed to examine whether exogenous estrogen (estradiol-17β; E2) affects early sex differentiation, paying particular attention to DMY expression and proliferation activity of germ cells in estrogen treated XY individuals. Our results showed that germ cell number was not affected by E2 treatment at hatching, and that DMY expression was not suppressed under conditions of sex reversal. Therefore, male differentiation of germ cells, which is triggered by the expression of DMY in the supporting cell lineage, proceeds even in E2 treated XY individuals until hatching, and early sex differentiation is not altered by estrogen. However, sex reversal occurred after hatching probably because of estrogen remaining in the yolk. Interestingly, DMY expression was also detected in the large follicle layer of E2 treated XY ovary. These results suggested that DMY regulates male determination in early embryonic stage but does not suppress female follicle development.In female fish estrogen is required for the development of primary and secondary sex characteristics and is derived from the aromatization of androgens by aromatase. There are two isoforms of aromatase in several teleost species, brain and ovarian. The objective of this study was two-fold: clone and sequence the coding and promoter region of brain aromatase in medaka, and determine the effects of exposure to an environmental estrogen (o,p-DDT) on sex determination and brain aromatase transcription and activity. The brain aromatase coding sequence was obtained by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and PCR-based genomic DNA walking was used to clone the promoter of the brain aromatase gene. The promoter sequence revealed potential binding sites for the estrogen receptor and for transcription factors involved in primary neurogenesis and sex determination. Medaka fry were exposed to increasing o,p-DDT concentrations (0–5.5 μg/L) from days 1 to 15 after hatch and brain aromatase expression and activity were measured on days 5, 9, and 14. A complete male-to-female sex reversal occurred at 5.5 μg/L o,p-DDT and aromatase activity and expression data showed a significant five-fold increase at this concentration at day 14. This information suggests that brain aromatase is involved in the abnormal sexual differentiation of fish treated with xenoestrogens.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Mature eggs were fertilized within the ovarian cavity after a sperm suspension was artificially introduced with a small bore-pipette through the urinogenital opening. Three batches of eggs ovulated within 48 hrs were fertilized and began to develop in the ovarian cavity, while eggs ovulated 72 hrs post-insemination (PI) were no longer fertilized. These observations indicate that ovulation occurs irrespective of the existence of developing embryos within the ovarian cavity. All embryos developing in the ovarian cavity were, however, retarded and ceased development before the stage of initiation of blood circulation at room temperature. These embryos developed normally and hatched after they were transferred from the ovarian cavity into regular saline 48 or 72 hrs PI. When these individuals matured sexually, their sex differentiation was found to be normal, and sex reversal was not observed.Working off-campus? Learn about our remote access optionsWe examined the effects on sexual differentiation of nanoinjecting ethinylestradiol (EE2) into embryos of olvas‐GFP/ST‐II YI medaka (Oryzias latipes). This strain contains the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene fused to the regulatory region of the medaka vasa gene, and germ‐cell‐specific expression of GFP can be visualized in living (transparent) individuals. The number of germ cells in untreated genotypic females (XX) was approximately 10‐fold that in untreated genotypic males (XY) at 10 d posthatch (dph). Germ cell proliferation was prevented in XX females that developed from embryos nanoinjected with 0.5, 2.5, or 5.0 ng of EE2. Some 10‐dph XY males from embryos injected with 0.5 ng or more of EE2 showed a larger fluorescent area and more germ cells than those of pooled control groups. Males and females from embryos injected with 5.0 ng of EE2 had no significant difference in germ cell number or fluorescent area. Thus, EE2 injection into embryos caused abnormal gonadal development in both sexes. Observations of external secondary sex characteristics and histological examination of adult gonads showed complete sex reversal in some males after 0.5‐, 2.5‐, and 5.0‐ng treatments but no changes in XX females after any treatment. Thus, quantitative bio‐imaging can aid in evaluating the effects of endocrine‐disrupting chemicals on fish within 10 dph.Volume24, Issue1January 2005Pages 70-77Copyright © 2005 SETACSETAC.orgEnvironmental Toxicology and Chemistry (ETC)Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management (IEAM)Working off-campus? Learn about our remote access optionsTo clarify the effect of exogenous estradiol‐17β (E2) on sex differentiation, the E2 content of developing eggs of Oryzias latipes was measured by radioimmunoassay. Endogenous E2 was present in lower concentrations in ovulated, mature eggs in the ovarian cavity than in intrafollicular oocytes. The E2 content of eggs precipitously declined to a minimum level by 2 days post‐fertilization. The E2 content of eggs was affected by 24 hr of incubation in medium containing exogenous E2 at concentrations above 10 ng/ml. Short (24 hr) exposure of fertilized eggs in the early developmental stage to exogenous E2 at concentrations of 10 ng/ml induced sex reversal of some genotypic males to functional females. However, endogenous E2 levels in fertilized eggs might not influence sexual differentiation in embryogenesis. The present results suggest the possibility that concentrations of exogenous E2 higher than that of endogenous E2 triggers a priming step in the cascade of sex differentiation toward the female, and this effect is maintained.

Zool. 303A:161–167, 2005. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.Volume303A, Issue21 February 2005Pages 161-167© 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.Alkylphenols including 4-tert-pentylphenol (4-PP) have been shown to alter sexual differentiation in fish due to their estrogenic properties. Medaka (Oryzias latipes) is so sensitive to these substances because morphological sex reversal and testis-ova induction are well developed in the exposed males. However, little work has been done to characterize the molecular effects of estrogenic substances on the morphological and gonadal feminization in male fish. Cytochrome P450 11β-hydroxylase (P45011β) is a key steroidogenic enzyme in production of 11-ketotestosterone which is the predominant androgen in male fish. In this study, we cloned a cDNA encoding medaka testicular P45011β, and then investigated the gene expression of P45011β in the testes of genetically male medaka exposed to 4-PP. The cDNA contains 1740 nucleotides that encode a protein of 543 amino acids, which shares 68.9% and 73.4% homology with testicular P45011βs from Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), respectively. HeLa cells transfected with an expression vector containing the open reading frame of medaka P45011β cDNA showed 11β-hydroxylating activity in the presence of exogenous testosterone. Analysis of tissue distribution by RT-PCR showed great abundance of P45011β mRNA in testis. In the partial life-cycle exposure with 4-PP, morphologically sex-reversal was observed in XY medaka exposed to 4-PP concentrations of ≥ 238 μg/L. Furthermore, exposure to 4-PP completely inhibited P45011β mRNA expression in the gonads of sex-reversed XY fish at 60-day posthatch. These results suggest that xeno-estrogen 4-PP may have inhibitory effects on the synthesis of testicular 11-oxygenated androgens through downregulation of P45011β expression in the genetically male fish.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

In the present study, we compare the estrogenic effects of phytoestrogens naringenin, 8-prenylnaringenin, 6-(1,1-dimethylallyl)naringenin, and the synthetic 4′-acetyl-7-prenyloxynaringenin. Two mammalian in vitro systems and a fish in vivo system were used to study the estrogenic properties with reference to genistein, 17-β-estradiol or ethynylestradiol. Strong differences were observed between the mammalian in vitro and the fish in vivo test system. In the medaka sex reversal/vtg gene expression assay no estrogenic effects of the naringenin-type flavonoids were observed, while mammalian in vitro systems showed a similar and graded response to the test compounds.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Intersex is often used as an indicator for disruption of sexual differentiation in fish exposed to different kinds of effluents from human activities. In wild fish it has exclusively been reported in terms of feminisation due to xenoestrogens in the environment. The assumption that the intersex individuals are feminised genetic males can only be proven by genetic sex identification of the intersexual individuals. Intersex and gonadal sex reversal were induced in three-spined sticklebacks by treatment with natural and synthetic steroid hormones. Juvenile sticklebacks were exposed to three nominal concentrations of 17β-oestradiol (E2); i.e. 0.01, 1.0 and 10.0 μg/L; which were administered to the water either continuously from hatching to the end of the experiment (39–58 days post hatch), during the first 2 weeks after hatching only, from 14 days after hatching onwards, or during the chorionated embryo stage until hatching. Other groups were exposed to 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) at 0.05 μg/L and 17α-methyltestosterone (MT) at 1.0 μg/L (nominal concentrations). MT was applied continuously, during the first 2 weeks post hatch only, or from 14 days after hatching onwards. Gonad histology was examined and the genetic sex was identified with male sex-linked PCR markers. Treatment with oestrogens caused feminisation at the two highest E2 concentrations and with EE2. Exposure to E2 before hatching had no effect. Intersexual individuals from oestrogen treatments were genetic males. The genetic sex marker identified apparent total reversal of the gonad type of genetic males. Treatment with MT did not reveal a clear picture, since intersex was observed in both genetic females and males. MT also caused severe testis abnormalities, mainly the development of large branched cavities with unidentified origin. The process of sex differentiation is most sensitive to the influence of external steroids during the first 2 weeks after hatching. A lower incidence of intersex could also be induced in sticklebacks exposed from 14 days after hatching by E2 treatment, but not with MT. The combination of gonad histopathology with genetic sex identification in juvenile sticklebacks is suggested as a tool for detecting endocrine disruption in laboratory studies, and might become very useful in field surveys.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Primary males develop directly as males while secondary males arise from the sex reversal of females. Fishes from Argentine and Brazil inland waters were collected, examined and compared for this study. In order to characterize the interstitial testicular compartment, light and electron microscopy techniques and an enzyme histochemical examination for steroidogenic cells detection were used. The interstitial compartment of S. marmoratus is composed of Leydig and myoid cells, collagen fibers, blood cells, macrophages,and amyelinic nerves. At the ultrastructural level, no differences were observed in the interstitial tissue, either between specimens from the different sampling sites or between primary and secondary males. Leydig cells are present in all testes examined throughout the year. A cytoplasmatic reaction of 3β-HSD was detected only in Leydig cells during sex reversal and in both type of males, mainly during the regressed and early maturation classes (autumn and winter). Leydig cells possess the typical fine structural characteristics associated with steroidogenesis. Furthermore, in both type of males, during sex reversal and after the spawning period, the number of granulocytes and macrophages present in the testes increased, suggesting that they could be involved in phagocytosis and resorption of damaged cells.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Several teleosts, such as zebrafish, medaka and pufferfish, are used as genetic model systems because they are amenable to studies of gene function. The rice field eel, a freshwater fish, is emerging as a specific model system for studies of vertebrate sexual development because of its small genome size and naturally occurring sex reversal. Data presented here support the use of the rice field eel as another important fish model for comparative genome studies, especially in vertebrate sexual development. This model system is complementary rather than redundant.   © 2003 S. Karger AG, BaselReceived: May 12, 2003

Mutations in human SOX9 cause campomelic dysplasia, a dominant skeletal dysmorphology syndrome often associated with male to female sex reversal. Here we show that the Sox9a gene was duplicated during evolution of the rice field eel, Monopterus albus, a freshwater fish which undergoes natural sex reversal from female to male during its life, and has a haploid genome size (0.6–0.8 pg) that is among the smallest of the vertebrates. The duplicated copies of the gene (named Sox9al and Sox9a2) fit within the Sox9 clade of vertebrates, especially in the Sox9a subfamily, not in the Sox9b subfamily. They have similar structures as revealed by both genomic and cDNA analysis. Furthermore, both Sox9al and Sox9a2 are expressed in testis, ovary, and ovotestis; and specifically in the outer layer (mainly gonocytes) of gonadal epithelium with bipotential capacity to form testis or ovary, suggesting that they have similar roles in gonadal differentiation during sex reversal in this species. The closely related gene structure and expression patterns of the two sox9a genes in the rice field eel also suggest that they arose in recent gene duplication events during evolution of this fish lineage.

Dev. 66: 211–217, 2003. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.Volume66, Issue3November 2003Pages 211-217Copyright © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.Author affiliationsThe first vertebrate master sex-determining gene different from Sry has been very recently discovered in a small aquarium fish, the medaka (Oryzias latipes). In this fish, the X and Y chromosomes apparently differ only by a 250-kb Y-specific region containing dmrt1bY (also called DMY and dmrt1Y), a male-specific copy of the autosomal gene dmrt1. Dmrt1 is a putative transcription factor probably involved in testis formation in different vertebrate lineages. Dmrt1bY is the only gene having escaped the drastic process of degeneration that devastated the small Y-specific region of the medaka. Mutations leading to truncation or lower expression of dmrt1bY result in XY male-to-female sex reversal. Hence, both genetic and functional evidences converge in making dmrt1bY an outstanding candidate for the function of a master sex-determining gene in fish. Nevertheless, dmrt1bY could not be detected in certain other Oryzias species or in more divergent fishes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the duplication of the autosomal dmrt1 that formed dmrt1bY is young in evolutionary terms. Hence, dmrt1bY is not the universal master sex-determining gene in fish. Because the classical fish models, such as zebrafish and pufferfish, are not very adequate to study the basis of genetic sex determination, alternative models, such as the platyfish (Xiphophorus maculatus), are re-emerging. In this fish, which is a well-suited laboratory organism, gene loci involved in pigmentation, melanoma formation, and sexual maturity have been mapped close to the master sex-determining gene. Interestingly, the platyfish can harbor three different sex chromosomes (W, X, and Y) in certain natural populations. Bacterial artificial chromosome contigs covering the sex-determining region of the platyfish are already available, and the positional cloning of the master sex-determining gene(s) should provide new insights into sex determination and sex chromosome evolution in fish and other vertebrates.   © 2002 S.

Karger AG, BaselWorking off-campus? Learn about our remote access optionsAbstract.— Modern theory predicts that relative parental investment of the sexes in their young is a key factor responsible for sexual selection. Seahorses and pipefishes (family Syngnathidae) are extraordinary among fishes in their remarkable adaptations for paternal care and frequent occurrences of sex‐role reversals (i.e., female‐female competition for mates), offering exceptional opportunities to test predictions of sexual selection theory. During mating, the female transfers eggs into or onto specialized egg‐brooding structures that are located on either the male's abdomen or its tail, where they are osmoregulated, aerated, and nourished by specially adapted structures. All syngnathid males exhibit this form of parental care but the brooding structures vary, ranging from the simple ventral gluing areas of some pipefishes to the completely enclosed pouches found in seahorses. We present a molecular phylogeny that indicates that the diversification of pouch types is positively correlated with the major evolutionary radiation of the group, suggesting that this extreme development and diversification of paternal care may have been an important evolutionary innovation of the Syngnathidae. Based on recent studies that show that the complexity of brooding structures reflects the degree of paternal investment in several syngnathid species, we predicted sex‐role reversals to be more common among species with more complex brooding structures. In contrast to this prediction, however, both parsimony‐ and likelihood‐based reconstructions of the evolution of sex‐role reversal in pipefishes and seahorses suggest multiple shifts in sex roles in the group, independent from the degree of brood pouch development. At the same time, our data demonstrate that sex‐role reversal is positively associated with polygamous mating patterns, whereas most nonreversed species mate monogamously, suggesting that selection for polygamy or monogamy in pipefishes and seahorses may strongly influence sex roles in the wild.Volume57, Issue6June 2003Pages 1374-1386Developmental exposure to 17β-estradiol (E2) induced the death of embryos and fry, malformations, sex reversal, and incomplete ossification of vertebrae and cranial bones in the cyprinodont fish, the mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus). To clarify the mechanism by which exogenous estrogens caused these developmental effects, we determined the sequence of an estrogen receptor (ER) coding region, encoded by 620 amino acid residues. This region shared 80% identity to that of ERα of medaka (Oryzias latipes). Northern blot analysis showed that two ERα mRNAs with 5.5 and 4 kb were expressed in the liver. These mRNAs were strongly induced by E2 stimulation. The 4 kb mRNA was expressed 8 h after treatment, whereas the 5.5 kb mRNA was not induced until 12 h after E2 stimulation. Vitellogenin (VTG) was expressed 8 h after E2 stimulation in the male liver. Receptor binding assays using the protein of F. heteroclitus ERα (fhERα) ligand binding domain showed that alkylphenols bind to fhERα with a higher affinity (50 times or more) as compared with the human ERα. The present results demonstrate that the fhERα has a sequence very similar to that of medaka, and the mRNA for this receptor was induced by E2-stimulation, followed subsequently by VTG expression. Furthermore, alkylphenols bind to fhERα more efficiently than to human ERα.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Learn about our remote access optionsThe swamp eel, Synbranchus marmoratus, is a protogynous, diandric species. During sex reversal, the ovarian germinal epithelium, which forms follicles containing an oocyte and encompassing follicle cells during the female portion of the life cycle, produces numerous invaginations, or acini, into the ovarian stroma. Within the acini, the gonia that formerly produced oocytes become spermatogonia, enter meiosis, and produce sperm. The acini are bounded by the basement membrane of the germinal epithelium. Epithelial cells of the female germinal epithelium, which formerly became follicle (granulosa) cells, now become Sertoli cells in the developing testis. Subsequently, lobules and testicular ducts form. The swamp eel testis has a lobular germinal compartment in both primary and secondary males, although the germinal compartment in testes of secondary males resides within the former ovarian lamellae. The germinal compartment, supported by a basement membrane, is composed of Sertoli and germ cells that give rise to sperm. Histological and immunohistochemical techniques were used to describe the five reproductive classes that were observed to occur during the annual reproductive cycle: regressed, early maturation, mid‐maturation, late maturation, and regression. These classes are differentiated by the presence of continuous or discontinuous germinal epithelia and by the types of germ cells present. Synbranchus marmoratus has a permanent germinal epithelium. Differences between the germinal compartment of the testes of primary and secondary males were not observed. J. Morphol. 257:107–126, 2003. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.Volume257, Issue1July 2003Pages 107-126Copyright © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.The model teleost medaka (Oryzias latipes, d-rR.YHNI strain) was used to produce offspring of a defined sex (monosex populations) by crossing experimentally produced YY and XX males to normal females. These monosex populations had the predicted chromosomal constitution as shown by a sex chromosome-specific DNA sequence. However, in XX populations the spontaneous development of males without previous exposure to androgens was observed. Differences in the percentage of male offspring from individual XX breeding pairs indicate a possible variation of unknown genetic factors to be responsible for the development of XX males. The expression of two gonadal genes that are involved in sex differentiation, Dmrt1b(Y) and Fig1a (factor in the germ line α), was analyzed in monosex populations. Dmrt1b(Y) expression correlated strictly with the genotype but not the sexual phenotype. When XY juvenile fish were exposed to 17α-ethynylestradiol at concentrations that induce sex reversal, Dmrt1b(Y) expression was not repressed. However, Dmrt1b(Y) was expressed in XY or YY gonads regardless of the sex and could not be detected in XX individuals. In contrast, the expression of Fig1a correlated with the phenotypic sex: Fig1a was expressed in male juvenile fish exposed to 17α-ethynylestradiol and repressed in fish exposed to 17α-methyltestosterone. The Dmrt1b(Y) expression appears to reflect an early and important event in sex determination and lends support to the suggested key regulatory role of the Dmrt1b(Y) gene in sex determination. This process is apparently hormone insensitive, and the expression of further downstream acting genes can be regulated (directly or indirectly) by sex steroids.In mammals, the sex determining gene Sry located on the Y chromosome triggers the development of the male phenotype [1]. A cascade of potential downstream genes including Dmrt1, Sox9, Amh, and others is involved in early male-specific differentiation [2–4]. Although in other vertebrates with genetic sex determination, no homolog of the Sry gene has been identified, genes acting downstream of the mammalian Sry show a conserved expression pattern in many vertebrates, regardless of whether the sex is genetically or environmentally determined. For example, the transcription factor Sox9 and the gene for the anti-Muellerian-hormone are involved in the early differentiation of the male phenotype in both mammals and reptiles [5, 6], and Dmrt1 is expressed during testicular differentiation in mouse, chicken, and rainbow trout [2, 7].Recently a different sex-determining gene of the medaka (Oryzias latipes) has been identified. The gene Dmrt1b(Y) (for Doublesex- and Mab-3-related transcription factors), a duplicated copy of the autosomal Dmrt1, is the only functional gene in the Y specific region and is expressed in pre-Sertoli and Sertoli cells (the gene was originally called DmY or Dmrt1Y; according to the nomenclature proposed by Volff et al. [8], Dmrt1b(Y) will be used throughout the text). The expression pattern makes it very likely that Dmrt1b(Y) is the male sex-determining gene, but the biochemical function of Dmrt1b(Y) is not known. The DM-domain, a DNA-binding motif, is also found in Drosophiladoublesex (Dsx) and ChaenorabditisMab-3 genes, which are both expressed downstream in the sex-determination cascade [9, 10].In contrast to mammals, sex determination in many fish including the medaka is labile, and the genetic sex can be reversed functionally by exposure to androgens or estrogens during a certain period of early juvenile development [11–14]. Monosex populations, offspring with only one sex, can be produced by crossing experimentally produced YY or XX males with normal females. This approach has been widely used in aquaculture because one sex is often favored for fish production because of sex-specific growth differences [15]. For scientific purpose, monosex populations allow the study of sex-specific genes during early development when phenotypic sex differences are not yet discernible. In the present study, we report the application of an improved protocol for the establishment of monosex populations using the d-rR.YHNI strain of the model teleost medaka. This strain is characterized by several sex markers: 1) The phenotypic sex can be determined by sex-specific fin characters (shape and size of the anal fin [12]); 2) the genetic sex is visible by the orange body color because the R-locus coding for a gene involved in the formation of orange chromatophores is active only on the Y chromosome [12]; and 3) a deletion in the SL1-locus on the Y chromosome allows identification of the genetic sex in embryos. Amplification with primers flanking this deletion produces polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products of different length for X and Y chromosomes [16] and allows the XY and YY genotypes to be distinguished. Both the r- and SL1-loci are sex-linked markers in the pseudoautosomal region and are not sex determining. Their distance to the sex-determining locus is 1.6–2.1 cM for SL1 [9, 10] and 0.36 cM for the r-locus [9].The established monosex populations were used to study the effect of sex hormone exposure on two early expressed sex-specific genes: Dmrt1b(Y), the sex-determining gene of medaka [9, 10] and Fig1a (factor in the germline α), an oocyte-specific gene expressed early in development [17].The medaka d-rR and Hd-rR.YHNI strains were kindly provided by Dr. Y. Wakamatsu (laboratory of fresh water fish stocks, Bioscience Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan) and Prof. M. Sakaizumi (Department of Environmental Science, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan). The animals were kept under a constant cycle of 16L:8D at 26°C (±1°C). Fish were fed ad libitum three times daily, once with Artemia and twice with commercial flake food (TetraMin, Tetra GmbH, Melle, Germany). Breeding was performed in 10-L tanks containing one male and one to three females.Exposure concentrations and conditions that are known to induce complete functional sex reversal were chosen [13, 18]. All exposure schemes started at the time of hatching. Genetic males were exposed to 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2, purity >97%, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) added to the water. Because addition of 17α-methyltestosterone (MT, purity >98%, Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) to the water caused sterility in all sex-reversed XX males (unpublished data), fish were fed with MT-containing flake food. Additional feeding of fish with Artemia may lead to a reduced uptake of contaminated flake food. Thus, to ensure sufficient dosage of MT for sex reversal and according to the original protocol of Yamamoto [13], fish exposed to MT (and appropriate control fish) were not fed with artemia.EE2 was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, purity 99%, Sigma) and added to the aquarium water to reach a final concentration of 100 ng/L EE2 and 0.005% (v/v) DMSO. Control fish were exposed to the same DMSO concentration. To avoid metabolic and microbial breakdown of EE2, 90% of the water was removed and replaced every 2 days with fresh EE2-contaminated water. Every 7 days all groups of experimental animals were placed into new aquaria with completely exchanged tank water. Sex-reversed fish were produced by exposing them for 2 months to EE2. Following the exposure the animals were kept in clean water until they had reached sexual maturity.To prepare MT-containing food, 25 μg MT was dissolved in 5 ml ethanol, mixed with 1 g flake food (Tetramin, Tetra), and the ethanol was evaporated overnight. Fertile sex-reversed XX males were produced by exposure for 3 months. Following the exposure the animals were fed with normal food until sexual maturity.Males of the Hd-rR.YHNI strain were crossed with females of the d-rR strain. Males from the offspring of this strain were crossed once again with females of the d-rR strain. The resulting strain was called d-rR.YHNI and maintained as a stock of approximately 100 individuals per generation. Animals used for the experiments were from the fourth-generation offspring.Monosex populations were produced according to Yamamoto [12, 13, 19] with some modifications. Offspring of the d-rR.YHNI strain were exposed to EE2 to produce XY females. XY females were identified by female fin characters associated with the Y-linked orange body color and crossed with normal XY males. Twenty-five percent of the offspring could be expected to be YY males, which could not be distinguished from XY males by fin morphology or body color. By analyzing the sex chromosome-specific DNA sequences, YY males could be identified and were crossed with XY females. The offspring of this cross was exposed to EE2 and YY females were identified by analysis of sex chromosome specific sequences. To maintain a stock of YY medaka, YY males and YY females were mated and some of their offspring were exposed to EE2. XX males were obtained by crossing normal d-rR.YHNI males and females and treating the offspring with MT. XX males could be identified by their body color. To maintain a stock of XX medaka, XX males were crossed with XX females and some of their offspring were exposed to MT.DNA was isolated from either a 2 × 3 mm2 piece of the anal fin or whole 6-day-old embryos after removing the chorion, according to Shinomiya et al. [20]. Briefly, fins or embryos were incubated for 60 min in 100 μl lysis buffer (0.1 mg/ml proteinase K, 100 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1% SDS). Then 100 μl of chloroform:phenol (1:1, buffer saturated) was added and mixed by vigorous shaking for 1 min. After centrifugation for 5 min at 12 000 g, DNA was precipitated from the upper phase by adding one tenth of the volume sodium acetate (3 M, pH 5.2) and an equal amount of isopropyl alcohol. After cooling for 20 min at −20°C, the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 12 000 × g, washed with 70% ethanol, and air dried. The DNA pellet was solubilized in 50 μl of sterile water. PCR was performed using the primers pHO5.5F (5′-CCT GCA ATG GGA AAT TAT TCT GCT C-3′) and pHO5.5RV (5′-CTT TTG TGT CTT TGG TTA TGA AAC GAT G-3′) at 55°C annealing temperature and 30 cycles.RNA was prepared from medaka embryos or juvenile fish with Trifast (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. If juvenile fish were used, head and tail were removed prior to RNA analysis. Because of the different exposure conditions, growth of juvenile fish exposed to MT was delayed when compared with fish exposed to EE2. To analyze gene expression in juvenile fish of the same size and stage of development, samples for RNA isolation were taken at 23 days for fish exposed to EE2 and 40 days for fish exposed to MT. The cDNA was synthesized from DNAse (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany)-treated RNA using oligo dT primer and Muloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). PCR was performed at 60°C annealing temperature for 30 (Actin, Fig1a) or 40 cycles (Dmrt1b(Y)) using Taq-polymerase (Peqlab) with 0.5 μl cDNA per 15 μl reaction volume. Actin transcripts were amplified using the primers 5′-AGG GAG AAG ATG ACC CAG ATC-3′ and 5′-CGC AGG ACG CCA TAC CAA-3′. Dmrt1b(Y) was amplified using 5′-CCG GGT GCC CAA GTG CTC CCG CTG-3′ as forward and 5′-GAT CGT CCC TCC ACA GAG AAG AGA-3′ as reverse primer. Fig1a was amplified using 5′-TAC TGC TGC ATC GAG AAG TAC AAG-3′ as forward and 5′-AGA GTA CAG CTG AAA GCA AAA TGA G-3′ as reverse primer. The primers for Actin and Dmrt1b(Y) were cDNA specific (i.e., because of introns in the sequence flanked by primers, amplification of genomic DNA resulted in larger fragments.)Alternative primers were used for the amplification of Dmrt1b(Y) and actin in embryos: For the detection of Dmrt1b(Y), the primers 5′-GGC CGG GTC CCC GGG TG-3′ and 5′-TGC GGC AGA CAG AGG ATT GG-3′ were used. Actin was amplified with 5′-TTA AAC AGC CCT GCC ATG TA-3′ as forward and 5′-GCA GCT CAT AGC TCT TCT CCA GGG AG-3′ as reverse primers.Statistically significant differences of the proportions of male offspring (P < 0.05) were analyzed by the Fisher’s exact test using the program GraphPad InStat, version 3.00 (GraphPad Software, San Diego CA, www.graphpad.com).Matsuda et al. [16] have established the medaka inbred strain Hd-rR.YHNI with a sex chromosome-specific DNA sequence. This strain showed reduced fecundity in our lab (i.e., the first spawning of females was delayed 1–2 months and fewer eggs were produced when compared with the d-rR strain). The d-rR strain [12] has the same Y-linked orange color marker as the Hdr-R.YHNI strain but lacks the sex chromosome-specific DNA sequences. By crossing of d-rR females with Hd-rR.YHNI males, the sex-specific chromosome sequence was introduced into the offspring of these parents. The resulting strain was called d-rR.YHNI, and no difference in fecundity could be observed, compared with the d-rR strain.By means of a series of hormone exposures and crossings described by Yamamoto [12, 13, 19], the d-rR.YHNI strain was used to produce XY females, YY males, YY females, and XX males. Because YY medaka cannot be distinguished from XY medaka by morphological criteria, Yamamoto performed backcrossings to identify the YY genotype. In contrast to the d-rR strain used by Yamamoto, the d-rR.YHNI strain allowed YY males and females to be identified by analysis of sex chromosome-specific DNA sequences. PCR of DNA from XY fish resulted in two distinct bands, but XX and YY fish showed only one specific band corresponding to either the X or Y chromosome (Fig. 1). By isolating DNA from the anal fin, YY animals were identified by the lack of the X-specific fragment after amplification of sex chromosome-specific DNA. The same fish from which the DNA samples of fin tissue had been taken were used in subsequent mating experiments.PCR analysis of the genotype of randomly selected individual 6-day-old embryos from the offspring of XY, XX, and YY males and females. The Y chromosome of the medaka strain d-rR.YHNI has a deletion flanked by the same primers binding also to the X chromosome. Amplification of the Y chromosome thus results in a fragment of lower molecular weight (DNA amplifications of embryos from XX x XX and YY x YY were run on the same gel)The genetic sex of the offspring was analyzed by isolating DNA from individual 6-day-old embryos. The determined genotypes of the offspring were consistent with the known genotypes of the parents: 1) a cross of normal XY males and XX females yielded embryos of either the genotype XY or XX; 2) offspring of the cross of YY males and XX females all had the male genotype; 3) by crossing sex-reversed XX males with XX females, 100% of the offspring were of the XX genotype; and 4) the offspring of YY males mated with sex-reversed YY females were all of the YY genotype.To test whether the phenotype matched the genotype in all crosses, the offspring were reared until sexual maturity and the phenotypic sex was determined by observation of the anal fins and dissection of the gonads (Table 1). In keeping with the Y-linked orange body color, all orange fish were phenotypic males. However, some males (2%) with white body color developed from the offspring of XY males mated with XX females. Among the offspring of sex-reversed XX males with XX females, 17% developed as males. Analysis of the sex chromosome-specific DNA confirmed the XX genotype of these males. Furthermore, the lack of Dmrt1b(Y) expression indicated that male differentiation was not caused by Dmrt1b(Y) transferred to the X chromosome by a historical cross-over event (Fig. 2). These result confirmed the findings on spontaneous sex-reversed XX males obtained for other strains of the medaka [21].Percentage of males and females in the offspring of XY, YY, and XX males and females.*Ten to 20 breeding pairs of males and females of the genotypes XX, YY, and XX were crossed (YY fish and XX males were produced experimentally). When the embryos had reached sexual maturity, the phenotypic sex was determined by observation of fin characters. Additionally, the male differentiation of the gonad was confirmed by dissection of the XX males. For experiment 5, three white males and three females were taken from the offspring of experiment 1, and their progeny was analyzed as described above.Analysis of the sex chromosomal genotype and the expression of the male-specific gene Dmrt1b(Y) in three white males observed in the offspring of a cross of normal orange XY males and XX females of the d-rR.YHNI strain of medaka. The genotype was detected by PCR with primers flanking a deletion on the Y chromosome (DNA was isolated from fins). RT-PCR was performed with RNA isolated from gonads of adult fish. As a control, gene expression was analyzed also in gonads of an XY male, YY female, and XX male. YY females and XX males were produced by hormone exposure. Actin served as a control for a constitutively expressed gene. To demonstrate specificity of the signal for cDNA, Actin and Dmrt1b(Y) were also amplified using genomic DNA of an XY male as templateThe reason for the occurrence of male differentiation in XX individuals is unclear. To test whether we could select for (or against) spontaneous male differentiation in this genotype, we analyzed offspring of 10 different XX mating pairs. Indeed, pairs with no male offspring and pairs with male offspring varying between 3.6% and 18.5% were observed (Fig. 3a). Statistical significance was reached only when the mating pair with the highest proportion of males was compared with pairs with no male offspring or compared with all other pairs. By testing the presumption that pairs with a certain percentage of male offspring belong to similar groups of a certain genetic predisposition, a statistically significant difference could be found for pairs with a high proportion of male offspring when compared with pairs with a low proportion of male offspring (Fig. 3b).Sex of the offspring from a cross of XX males (experimentally produced by exposure to MT) mated with normal XX females. The percentage of XX males was analyzed separately for the offspring of 10 breeding pairs (a). Numbers above the bars indicate sample numbers. Statistic significance was analyzed by the Fisher’s exact test comparing individual pairs and groups of pairs (b)If the difference in the percentage of XX males between individual mating pairs was based on a genetic difference, mating of spontaneous XX males (i.e., males that have occurred without exposure to hormones) to normal females might result in an increased percentage of male offspring in the following generation. However, this increase was not observed (Table 1, experiment 5).The XX mating pairs that previously did not show any spontaneous development of XX males in their offspring were chosen to analyze gene expression and its relationship to phenotypic and genotypic sex.Using the previously established monosex populations, Dmrt1b(Y) expression was detected specifically by RT-PCR in RNA pools of XY embryos. However, Dmrt1b(Y) was not expressed in XX embryo populations (Fig. 4).Dmrt1b(Y) expression in 7-day-old embryos of medaka monosex populations. YY males were crossed with XX females to obtain all male populations, and XX males were crossed with XX females to obtain all female populations. Embryos were reared without exposure to hormones and RT-PCR was performed from three batches of 20 embryos of either XX or XY embryos (XX1, XX2, etc. describe different batches of 20 embryos used for RNA isolation; molecular weight marker not shown)To analyze the effect of hormonal sex reversal on the expression of Dmrt1b(Y) and Fig1a, fish were exposed to EE2 or MT. Because Fig1a could not be detected in female (XX) fish prior to 23 days after hatching, the reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis of gene expression after sex reversal was carried out at this stage of development. Fig1a was expressed in normal juvenile XX females and experimentally produced sex-reversed XY females, but XY males did not express this gene. Exposure of XX fish to MT repressed expression of Fig1a (Fig. 5). These experiments show that the expression of Fig1a was linked to the phenotypic sex. The lack of expression of Fig1a in one sex-reversed XY female may be attributed to a delay in growth, which has been observed occasionally for individual fish. In contrast to Fig1a, expression of the master regulating gene Dmrt1b(Y) appears to be linked to the genetic sex: Dmrt1b(Y) expression was not repressed in sex-reversed XY females. Because Dmrt1b(Y) is located only on the Y chromosome, no expression was observed in XX medaka (Fig. 5). Some very weak bands in RT-PCR samples of XX females in the size of the Dmrt1b(Y) band were unspecific artifacts because Dmrt1b(Y) principally cannot be detected in genomic DNA preparations of XX medaka (data not shown).Effect of hormone exposure on the expression of the female-specific Fig1a and male-specific Dmrt1b(Y) gene in juvenile (23-day post hatching) medaka. Fish were exposed from hatching until the preparation of samples in 100 ng/L ethynylestradiol. For androgen exposure, fish were fed with food supplemented with 25 μg MT per gram of food. Samples were taken 40 days after hatching. Gene expression was analyzed in 10 (or 9 for XX controls, 2 for fish exposed to MT) fish by RT-PCR. Each lane represents one individual animal. C, Control; MT, exposed with methyltestosteroneAnalysis of sex specifically expressed genes in early development of fish requires sexing of individual embryos or larvae. For the model teleost medaka (Oryzias latipes), several markers for the early identification of the genetic sex are available if appropriate strains are used. One marker is the d-rR strain, which allows the identification of genetic males by observation of orange chromatophores (r-locus, [12]). However, orange chromatophores cannot be identified prior to approximately 2 wk after hatching, and the orange color is often weak and difficult to observe. Furthermore, in a small percentage of cases (<0.5%) the color marker does not segregate with the male sex and orange females develop. In these exceptional cases, presumably cross-over between the r-locus and a sex-determining locus on the Y chromosome took place. Another marker is in the Quart strain, in which formation of leucophores (lf-locus), visible in the embryo from 4 days post fertilization, is restricted to males [22]. Similar to the r-locus, an inferred recombination frequency of 2.2% was observed. Yet another marker, the Hd-rR.YHNI [16] or d-rR.YHNI strains (this study), offers the possibility of identifying the sex of embryos by analysis of sex chromosome-specific DNA. However, this technique would require the simultaneous isolation of DNA and RNA in individual fish.The production of monosex populations is an alternative approach circumventing the sexing of individual fish. The present study has demonstrated that monosex population can be established and controlled using a molecular marker. YY and XX males were mated with normal females, and the unique genetic sex of the offspring was detected by the analysis of sex chromosome-specific DNA sequences. For male monosex populations, genetic sex clearly matched the phenotypic sex. However, XX monosex populations consisting of only female genotypes had up to 18.5% phenotypic males. Because these males were lacking the expression of the sex-determining gene Dmrt1b(Y), it could not be excluded that spontaneous development of XX males without exposure to androgens is caused by a combination of unknown genetic factors. Different frequencies of XX males in medaka, depending on the strain, have also been observed: Some strains did not show any occurrence of XX males, suggesting that the development of XX males might be caused by unknown genetic factors in the d-rR.YHNI strain [21]. Crossing the offspring of those mating pairs with a high percentage of XX males (this study) did not result in a further increase in the percentage of XX males or at least a reproducibly high percentage. The genetic (or epigenetic) basis for the observed instability remains to be elucidated. To establish XX female monosex populations with virtually no male offspring, selection of appropriate XX breeding pairs will be continued for several generations and may support or disprove a genetic basis for the spontaneous development of XX males.Monosex populations were used to analyze Dmrt1b(Y) and Fig1a, two sex-specific gonadal genes expressed during early development. Dmrt1b(Y) could be detected in 7-day-old embryos of male monosex populations but was not detectable in XX embryos. Dmrt1b(Y) expression was hormone insensitive and appeared to be linked to the genetic sex: If juvenile XY fish were exposed to EE2 at sex-reversing concentrations, expression of Dmrt1b(Y) was not repressed. In contrast, Fig1a was hormone sensitive, could be induced in genetic males by exposure to EE2, and was repressed by MT. The difference in the expression of both genes is in keeping with their suggested function. Although not structurally related, Dmrt1b(Y) resembles the mammalian Sry master regulating function for sex determination [23]. It is probably the first gene in the male differentiation pathway of medaka, and it may not have any function other than initiating a gene cascade leading to male development [9, 10]. The apparent hormone insensitivity of Dmrt1b(Y) supports this key regulatory function in sex determination. Unlike Dmrt1b(Y), Fig1a is not a master regulating gene but, with respect to the sex-determining cascade, is probably a further downstream acting gene involved in the phenotypic differentiation of the ovary [24]. The gene is expressed during early oocyte development and has been identified by subtractive cloning in fish larvae just 1 day after hatching [17]. The mouse homolog is a germ cell-specific transcription factor involved in the co-ordinate expression of the zona pellucida genes [24]. Its linkage to an important structural component of the oocyte explains its expression in genetic males exposed to sex-reversing estrogen concentrations.Analysis of the sex specifically expressed genes Dmrt1b(Y) and Fig1a in medaka and the effect of hormone exposure have clearly demonstrated the usefulness of monosex populations. The relatively easy experimental manipulation of sexual differentiation in fish and the analysis of key genes present in all vertebrates offers an attractive model system to unravel the molecular mechanisms of sex determination and differentiation.We thank Dr. Y.

It furthers the University's objective of excellence in research, scholarship, and education by publishing worldwideThe model teleost medaka (Oryzias latipes, d-rR.YHNI strain) was used to produce offspring of a defined sex (monosex populations) by crossing experimentally produced YY and XX males to normal females. These monosex populations had the predicted chromosomal constitution as shown by a sex chromosome-specific DNA sequence. However, in XX populations the spontaneous development of males without previous exposure to androgens was observed. Differences in the percentage of male offspring from individual XX breeding pairs indicate a possible variation of unknown genetic factors to be responsible for the development of XX males. The expression of two gonadal genes that are involved in sex differentiation, Dmrt1b(Y) and Fig1a (factor in the germ line α), was analyzed in monosex populations. Dmrt1b(Y) expression correlated strictly with the genotype but not the sexual phenotype. When XY juvenile fish were exposed to 17α-ethynylestradiol at concentrations that induce sex reversal, Dmrt1b(Y) expression was not repressed. However, Dmrt1b(Y) was expressed in XY or YY gonads regardless of the sex and could not be detected in XX individuals. In contrast, the expression of Fig1a correlated with the phenotypic sex: Fig1a was expressed in male juvenile fish exposed to 17α-ethynylestradiol and repressed in fish exposed to 17α-methyltestosterone. The Dmrt1b(Y) expression appears to reflect an early and important event in sex determination and lends support to the suggested key regulatory role of the Dmrt1b(Y) gene in sex determination. This process is apparently hormone insensitive, and the expression of further downstream acting genes can be regulated (directly or indirectly) by sex steroids.In mammals, the sex determining gene Sry located on the Y chromosome triggers the development of the male phenotype [1]. A cascade of potential downstream genes including Dmrt1, Sox9, Amh, and others is involved in early male-specific differentiation [2–4]. Although in other vertebrates with genetic sex determination, no homolog of the Sry gene has been identified, genes acting downstream of the mammalian Sry show a conserved expression pattern in many vertebrates, regardless of whether the sex is genetically or environmentally determined. For example, the transcription factor Sox9 and the gene for the anti-Muellerian-hormone are involved in the early differentiation of the male phenotype in both mammals and reptiles [5, 6], and Dmrt1 is expressed during testicular differentiation in mouse, chicken, and rainbow trout [2, 7].Recently a different sex-determining gene of the medaka (Oryzias latipes) has been identified. The gene Dmrt1b(Y) (for Doublesex- and Mab-3-related transcription factors), a duplicated copy of the autosomal Dmrt1, is the only functional gene in the Y specific region and is expressed in pre-Sertoli and Sertoli cells (the gene was originally called DmY or Dmrt1Y; according to the nomenclature proposed by Volff et al. [8], Dmrt1b(Y) will be used throughout the text). The expression pattern makes it very likely that Dmrt1b(Y) is the male sex-determining gene, but the biochemical function of Dmrt1b(Y) is not known. The DM-domain, a DNA-binding motif, is also found in Drosophiladoublesex (Dsx) and ChaenorabditisMab-3 genes, which are both expressed downstream in the sex-determination cascade [9, 10].In contrast to mammals, sex determination in many fish including the medaka is labile, and the genetic sex can be reversed functionally by exposure to androgens or estrogens during a certain period of early juvenile development [11–14]. Monosex populations, offspring with only one sex, can be produced by crossing experimentally produced YY or XX males with normal females. This approach has been widely used in aquaculture because one sex is often favored for fish production because of sex-specific growth differences [15]. For scientific purpose, monosex populations allow the study of sex-specific genes during early development when phenotypic sex differences are not yet discernible. In the present study, we report the application of an improved protocol for the establishment of monosex populations using the d-rR.YHNI strain of the model teleost medaka. This strain is characterized by several sex markers: 1) The phenotypic sex can be determined by sex-specific fin characters (shape and size of the anal fin [12]); 2) the genetic sex is visible by the orange body color because the R-locus coding for a gene involved in the formation of orange chromatophores is active only on the Y chromosome [12]; and 3) a deletion in the SL1-locus on the Y chromosome allows identification of the genetic sex in embryos. Amplification with primers flanking this deletion produces polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products of different length for X and Y chromosomes [16] and allows the XY and YY genotypes to be distinguished. Both the r- and SL1-loci are sex-linked markers in the pseudoautosomal region and are not sex determining. Their distance to the sex-determining locus is 1.6–2.1 cM for SL1 [9, 10] and 0.36 cM for the r-locus [9].The established monosex populations were used to study the effect of sex hormone exposure on two early expressed sex-specific genes: Dmrt1b(Y), the sex-determining gene of medaka [9, 10] and Fig1a (factor in the germline α), an oocyte-specific gene expressed early in development [17].The medaka d-rR and Hd-rR.YHNI strains were kindly provided by Dr. Y. Wakamatsu (laboratory of fresh water fish stocks, Bioscience Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan) and Prof. M. Sakaizumi (Department of Environmental Science, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan). The animals were kept under a constant cycle of 16L:8D at 26°C (±1°C). Fish were fed ad libitum three times daily, once with Artemia and twice with commercial flake food (TetraMin, Tetra GmbH, Melle, Germany). Breeding was performed in 10-L tanks containing one male and one to three females.Exposure concentrations and conditions that are known to induce complete functional sex reversal were chosen [13, 18]. All exposure schemes started at the time of hatching. Genetic males were exposed to 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2, purity >97%, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) added to the water. Because addition of 17α-methyltestosterone (MT, purity >98%, Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) to the water caused sterility in all sex-reversed XX males (unpublished data), fish were fed with MT-containing flake food. Additional feeding of fish with Artemia may lead to a reduced uptake of contaminated flake food. Thus, to ensure sufficient dosage of MT for sex reversal and according to the original protocol of Yamamoto [13], fish exposed to MT (and appropriate control fish) were not fed with artemia.EE2 was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, purity 99%, Sigma) and added to the aquarium water to reach a final concentration of 100 ng/L EE2 and 0.005% (v/v) DMSO. Control fish were exposed to the same DMSO concentration. To avoid metabolic and microbial breakdown of EE2, 90% of the water was removed and replaced every 2 days with fresh EE2-contaminated water. Every 7 days all groups of experimental animals were placed into new aquaria with completely exchanged tank water. Sex-reversed fish were produced by exposing them for 2 months to EE2. Following the exposure the animals were kept in clean water until they had reached sexual maturity.To prepare MT-containing food, 25 μg MT was dissolved in 5 ml ethanol, mixed with 1 g flake food (Tetramin, Tetra), and the ethanol was evaporated overnight. Fertile sex-reversed XX males were produced by exposure for 3 months. Following the exposure the animals were fed with normal food until sexual maturity.Males of the Hd-rR.YHNI strain were crossed with females of the d-rR strain. Males from the offspring of this strain were crossed once again with females of the d-rR strain. The resulting strain was called d-rR.YHNI and maintained as a stock of approximately 100 individuals per generation. Animals used for the experiments were from the fourth-generation offspring.Monosex populations were produced according to Yamamoto [12, 13, 19] with some modifications. Offspring of the d-rR.YHNI strain were exposed to EE2 to produce XY females. XY females were identified by female fin characters associated with the Y-linked orange body color and crossed with normal XY males. Twenty-five percent of the offspring could be expected to be YY males, which could not be distinguished from XY males by fin morphology or body color. By analyzing the sex chromosome-specific DNA sequences, YY males could be identified and were crossed with XY females. The offspring of this cross was exposed to EE2 and YY females were identified by analysis of sex chromosome specific sequences. To maintain a stock of YY medaka, YY males and YY females were mated and some of their offspring were exposed to EE2. XX males were obtained by crossing normal d-rR.YHNI males and females and treating the offspring with MT. XX males could be identified by their body color. To maintain a stock of XX medaka, XX males were crossed with XX females and some of their offspring were exposed to MT.DNA was isolated from either a 2 × 3 mm2 piece of the anal fin or whole 6-day-old embryos after removing the chorion, according to Shinomiya et al. [20]. Briefly, fins or embryos were incubated for 60 min in 100 μl lysis buffer (0.1 mg/ml proteinase K, 100 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1% SDS). Then 100 μl of chloroform:phenol (1:1, buffer saturated) was added and mixed by vigorous shaking for 1 min. After centrifugation for 5 min at 12 000 g, DNA was precipitated from the upper phase by adding one tenth of the volume sodium acetate (3 M, pH 5.2) and an equal amount of isopropyl alcohol. After cooling for 20 min at −20°C, the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 12 000 × g, washed with 70% ethanol, and air dried. The DNA pellet was solubilized in 50 μl of sterile water. PCR was performed using the primers pHO5.5F (5′-CCT GCA ATG GGA AAT TAT TCT GCT C-3′) and pHO5.5RV (5′-CTT TTG TGT CTT TGG TTA TGA AAC GAT G-3′) at 55°C annealing temperature and 30 cycles.RNA was prepared from medaka embryos or juvenile fish with Trifast (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. If juvenile fish were used, head and tail were removed prior to RNA analysis. Because of the different exposure conditions, growth of juvenile fish exposed to MT was delayed when compared with fish exposed to EE2. To analyze gene expression in juvenile fish of the same size and stage of development, samples for RNA isolation were taken at 23 days for fish exposed to EE2 and 40 days for fish exposed to MT. The cDNA was synthesized from DNAse (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany)-treated RNA using oligo dT primer and Muloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). PCR was performed at 60°C annealing temperature for 30 (Actin, Fig1a) or 40 cycles (Dmrt1b(Y)) using Taq-polymerase (Peqlab) with 0.5 μl cDNA per 15 μl reaction volume. Actin transcripts were amplified using the primers 5′-AGG GAG AAG ATG ACC CAG ATC-3′ and 5′-CGC AGG ACG CCA TAC CAA-3′. Dmrt1b(Y) was amplified using 5′-CCG GGT GCC CAA GTG CTC CCG CTG-3′ as forward and 5′-GAT CGT CCC TCC ACA GAG AAG AGA-3′ as reverse primer. Fig1a was amplified using 5′-TAC TGC TGC ATC GAG AAG TAC AAG-3′ as forward and 5′-AGA GTA CAG CTG AAA GCA AAA TGA G-3′ as reverse primer. The primers for Actin and Dmrt1b(Y) were cDNA specific (i.e., because of introns in the sequence flanked by primers, amplification of genomic DNA resulted in larger fragments.)Alternative primers were used for the amplification of Dmrt1b(Y) and actin in embryos: For the detection of Dmrt1b(Y), the primers 5′-GGC CGG GTC CCC GGG TG-3′ and 5′-TGC GGC AGA CAG AGG ATT GG-3′ were used. Actin was amplified with 5′-TTA AAC AGC CCT GCC ATG TA-3′ as forward and 5′-GCA GCT CAT AGC TCT TCT CCA GGG AG-3′ as reverse primers.Statistically significant differences of the proportions of male offspring (P < 0.05) were analyzed by the Fisher’s exact test using the program GraphPad InStat, version 3.00 (GraphPad Software, San Diego CA, www.graphpad.com).Matsuda et al. [16] have established the medaka inbred strain Hd-rR.YHNI with a sex chromosome-specific DNA sequence. This strain showed reduced fecundity in our lab (i.e., the first spawning of females was delayed 1–2 months and fewer eggs were produced when compared with the d-rR strain). The d-rR strain [12] has the same Y-linked orange color marker as the Hdr-R.YHNI strain but lacks the sex chromosome-specific DNA sequences. By crossing of d-rR females with Hd-rR.YHNI males, the sex-specific chromosome sequence was introduced into the offspring of these parents. The resulting strain was called d-rR.YHNI, and no difference in fecundity could be observed, compared with the d-rR strain.By means of a series of hormone exposures and crossings described by Yamamoto [12, 13, 19], the d-rR.YHNI strain was used to produce XY females, YY males, YY females, and XX males.

In contrast to the d-rR strain used by Yamamoto, the d-rR.YHNI strain allowed YY males and females to be identified by analysis of sex chromosome-specific DNA sequences. PCR of DNA from XY fish resulted in two distinct bands, but XX and YY fish showed only one specific band corresponding to either the X or Y chromosome (Fig. 1).

In keeping with the Y-linked orange body color, all orange fish were phenotypic males. However, some males (2%) with white body color developed from the offspring of XY males mated with XX females. Among the offspring of sex-reversed XX males with XX females, 17% developed as males. Analysis of the sex chromosome-specific DNA confirmed the XX genotype of these males. Furthermore, the lack of Dmrt1b(Y) expression indicated that male differentiation was not caused by Dmrt1b(Y) transferred to the X chromosome by a historical cross-over event (Fig. 2). These result confirmed the findings on spontaneous sex-reversed XX males obtained for other strains of the medaka [21].Percentage of males and females in the offspring of XY, YY, and XX males and females.*Ten to 20 breeding pairs of males and females of the genotypes XX, YY, and XX were crossed (YY fish and XX males were produced experimentally).

The percentage of XX males was analyzed separately for the offspring of 10 breeding pairs (a). Numbers above the bars indicate sample numbers. Statistic significance was analyzed by the Fisher’s exact test comparing individual pairs and groups of pairs (b)If the difference in the percentage of XX males between individual mating pairs was based on a genetic difference, mating of spontaneous XX males (i.e., males that have occurred without exposure to hormones) to normal females might result in an increased percentage of male offspring in the following generation. However, this increase was not observed (Table 1, experiment 5).The XX mating pairs that previously did not show any spontaneous development of XX males in their offspring were chosen to analyze gene expression and its relationship to phenotypic and genotypic sex.Using the previously established monosex populations, Dmrt1b(Y) expression was detected specifically by RT-PCR in RNA pools of XY embryos. However, Dmrt1b(Y) was not expressed in XX embryo populations (Fig. 4).Dmrt1b(Y) expression in 7-day-old embryos of medaka monosex populations. YY males were crossed with XX females to obtain all male populations, and XX males were crossed with XX females to obtain all female populations. Embryos were reared without exposure to hormones and RT-PCR was performed from three batches of 20 embryos of either XX or XY embryos (XX1, XX2, etc. describe different batches of 20 embryos used for RNA isolation; molecular weight marker not shown)To analyze the effect of hormonal sex reversal on the expression of Dmrt1b(Y) and Fig1a, fish were exposed to EE2 or MT. Because Fig1a could not be detected in female (XX) fish prior to 23 days after hatching, the reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis of gene expression after sex reversal was carried out at this stage of development. Fig1a was expressed in normal juvenile XX females and experimentally produced sex-reversed XY females, but XY males did not express this gene. Exposure of XX fish to MT repressed expression of Fig1a (Fig. 5). These experiments show that the expression of Fig1a was linked to the phenotypic sex. The lack of expression of Fig1a in one sex-reversed XY female may be attributed to a delay in growth, which has been observed occasionally for individual fish. In contrast to Fig1a, expression of the master regulating gene Dmrt1b(Y) appears to be linked to the genetic sex: Dmrt1b(Y) expression was not repressed in sex-reversed XY females. Because Dmrt1b(Y) is located only on the Y chromosome, no expression was observed in XX medaka (Fig. 5). Some very weak bands in RT-PCR samples of XX females in the size of the Dmrt1b(Y) band were unspecific artifacts because Dmrt1b(Y) principally cannot be detected in genomic DNA preparations of XX medaka (data not shown).Effect of hormone exposure on the expression of the female-specific Fig1a and male-specific Dmrt1b(Y) gene in juvenile (23-day post hatching) medaka. Fish were exposed from hatching until the preparation of samples in 100 ng/L ethynylestradiol. For androgen exposure, fish were fed with food supplemented with 25 μg MT per gram of food. Samples were taken 40 days after hatching. Gene expression was analyzed in 10 (or 9 for XX controls, 2 for fish exposed to MT) fish by RT-PCR. Each lane represents one individual animal. C, Control; MT, exposed with methyltestosteroneAnalysis of sex specifically expressed genes in early development of fish requires sexing of individual embryos or larvae. For the model teleost medaka (Oryzias latipes), several markers for the early identification of the genetic sex are available if appropriate strains are used. One marker is the d-rR strain, which allows the identification of genetic males by observation of orange chromatophores (r-locus, [12]). However, orange chromatophores cannot be identified prior to approximately 2 wk after hatching, and the orange color is often weak and difficult to observe. Furthermore, in a small percentage of cases (<0.5%) the color marker does not segregate with the male sex and orange females develop. In these exceptional cases, presumably cross-over between the r-locus and a sex-determining locus on the Y chromosome took place. Another marker is in the Quart strain, in which formation of leucophores (lf-locus), visible in the embryo from 4 days post fertilization, is restricted to males [22]. Similar to the r-locus, an inferred recombination frequency of 2.2% was observed. Yet another marker, the Hd-rR.YHNI [16] or d-rR.YHNI strains (this study), offers the possibility of identifying the sex of embryos by analysis of sex chromosome-specific DNA. However, this technique would require the simultaneous isolation of DNA and RNA in individual fish.The production of monosex populations is an alternative approach circumventing the sexing of individual fish. The present study has demonstrated that monosex population can be established and controlled using a molecular marker. YY and XX males were mated with normal females, and the unique genetic sex of the offspring was detected by the analysis of sex chromosome-specific DNA sequences. For male monosex populations, genetic sex clearly matched the phenotypic sex. However, XX monosex populations consisting of only female genotypes had up to 18.5% phenotypic males. Because these males were lacking the expression of the sex-determining gene Dmrt1b(Y), it could not be excluded that spontaneous development of XX males without exposure to androgens is caused by a combination of unknown genetic factors. Different frequencies of XX males in medaka, depending on the strain, have also been observed: Some strains did not show any occurrence of XX males, suggesting that the development of XX males might be caused by unknown genetic factors in the d-rR.YHNI strain [21]. Crossing the offspring of those mating pairs with a high percentage of XX males (this study) did not result in a further increase in the percentage of XX males or at least a reproducibly high percentage. The genetic (or epigenetic) basis for the observed instability remains to be elucidated. To establish XX female monosex populations with virtually no male offspring, selection of appropriate XX breeding pairs will be continued for several generations and may support or disprove a genetic basis for the spontaneous development of XX males.Monosex populations were used to analyze Dmrt1b(Y) and Fig1a, two sex-specific gonadal genes expressed during early development. Dmrt1b(Y) could be detected in 7-day-old embryos of male monosex populations but was not detectable in XX embryos. Dmrt1b(Y) expression was hormone insensitive and appeared to be linked to the genetic sex: If juvenile XY fish were exposed to EE2 at sex-reversing concentrations, expression of Dmrt1b(Y) was not repressed. In contrast, Fig1a was hormone sensitive, could be induced in genetic males by exposure to EE2, and was repressed by MT. The difference in the expression of both genes is in keeping with their suggested function. Although not structurally related, Dmrt1b(Y) resembles the mammalian Sry master regulating function for sex determination [23]. It is probably the first gene in the male differentiation pathway of medaka, and it may not have any function other than initiating a gene cascade leading to male development [9, 10]. The apparent hormone insensitivity of Dmrt1b(Y) supports this key regulatory function in sex determination. Unlike Dmrt1b(Y), Fig1a is not a master regulating gene but, with respect to the sex-determining cascade, is probably a further downstream acting gene involved in the phenotypic differentiation of the ovary [24]. The gene is expressed during early oocyte development and has been identified by subtractive cloning in fish larvae just 1 day after hatching [17]. The mouse homolog is a germ cell-specific transcription factor involved in the co-ordinate expression of the zona pellucida genes [24]. Its linkage to an important structural component of the oocyte explains its expression in genetic males exposed to sex-reversing estrogen concentrations.Analysis of the sex specifically expressed genes Dmrt1b(Y) and Fig1a in medaka and the effect of hormone exposure have clearly demonstrated the usefulness of monosex populations. The relatively easy experimental manipulation of sexual differentiation in fish and the analysis of key genes present in all vertebrates offers an attractive model system to unravel the molecular mechanisms of sex determination and differentiation.We thank Dr. Y.

It furthers the University's objective of excellence in research, scholarship, and education by publishing worldwideDespite being banned in many countries, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) continue to be found in fish tissues at concentrations of concern. Like o,p -DDT, o,p -DDE is estrogenic and is believed to exert its effects through binding to the estrogen receptor. The limited toxicologic data for o,p -DDE suggest that it decreases fecundity and fertility of fishes. We conducted an egg injection study using the d-rR strain of medaka and environmentally relevant concentrations of o,p -DDE to examine its effects on sexual differentiation and development. The gonads of exposed fish showed no evidence of sex reversal or intersex. However, other gonad abnormalities occurred in exposed individuals. Females exhibited few vitellogenic oocytes and increased atresia. Male testes appeared morphologically normal but were very small. Gonadosomatic index values for both sexes were lower for exposed fish. Our observations of abnormal female and very small male gonads after in ovo o,p -DDE exposure may be indicative of effects on early endocrine processes important for normal ovarian and testicular development.Working off-campus? Learn about our remote access optionsMany chemicals released into the environment exhibit estrogenic activity, having the potential to disrupt development and the functioning of the endocrine system. In order to establish a model system to study the effects of such environmental chemicals on aquatic animals, we examined the effects of a natural estrogen, 17β‐estradiol (E2), on early development of Fundulus heteroclitus. Embryos of F. heteroclitus were reared in seawater containing 10−10, 10−8, and 10−6 M E2 throughout the experiment. Hatching and survival rates decreased in a dose‐dependent manner, and fry treated with 10−6 M E2 and 10−8 M E2 were dead by two weeks and 12 weeks after hatching, respectively. More than 85% of fry treated with 10−8 M E2 showed malformations: i.e., eye extrusion, crooked vertebral column, faded lateral‐stripe pattern eight weeks after hatching. Body weight and head and body lengths were significantly reduced in E2‐treated fry when compared to controls. Ossification was not completed in vertebrae, cranial bones, and other bones in fry treated with 10−8 M E2 even 12 weeks after hatching. Sex ratio of control fry was 57% male and 43% female, whereas fry treated with 10−8 M E2 were 100% female eight weeks after hatching. The present results demonstrate that exogenous estrogen induced death of embryos and fry, malformations, sex reversal, and incomplete ossification of vertebrae and cranial bones, which would result in shorter body and head lengths and in malformed vertebrae leading to a hunchback condition.

Learn about our remote access optionsSox9 is a transcription factor containing the Sry‐related high‐mobility‐group (HMG) box. Mutations in human SOX9 gene cause skeletal defects and male‐to‐female sex reversal, indicating its essential roles in chondrogenesis and testis development. Comparative studies have shown that Sox9 is expressed in chondrogenic tissues and testis in other vertebrates. Therefore, it was suggested that roles of Sox9 in cartilage and male gonad development are conserved among vertebrates. To investigate the evolutional significance of Sox9 in the gonad and cartilage development of teleost fish, we isolated medaka sox9 and analyzed its expression. Two kinds of transcripts (sox9 and sox9lf) were isolated by cDNA library screening. The sox9 encoded 487 amino acids and showed approximately 70% amino acid identity with known vertebrate SOX9 proteins. The sox9lf was a longer form of the sox9, which was transcribed from an additional exon in the 5′ upstream region. Interestingly, the expression of medaka sox9 was predominantly observed in the adult ovary by northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses, whereas in the testis, its expression was detectable only by RT‐PCR. During medaka embryogenesis, its expression was observed in the cranial cartilage and pectoral fin endoskeleton. These observations suggest that the function of Sox9 in the cartilage is conserved among vertebrates, while that in the gonad is quite different in medaka. Mol. Reprod.

Exposure to ≥2μg/L octylphenol caused a 20–30% increase in mortality both before and after hatch. Growth was significantly decreased in fish exposed to 50 μg/L octylphenol and in the positive control. Sex ratio changed from 42:58 (females:males) in controls to 57:40 at 50 μg/L octylphenol, and 3 and 4% of the medaka exposed to 50 μg/L octylphenol and 17β-estradiol developed testes–ova. In cross-mating experiments, mating of exposed males with control females resulted in an up to 11% lower fertilization rate than in controls. Results indicate that continuous exposure to octylphenol causes a broad variety of reproductive effects, which can be correlated with the xenoestrogenic potential of octylphenol.To whom correspondence should be addressed.

However, more recent work has called into question the idea that all species with male pregnancy are sex–role reversed with respect to the intensity of sexual selection. Furthermore, no studies have formally quantified the opportunity for sexual selection in any natural breeding assemblage of pipefishes or seahorses in order to demonstrate conclusively that sexual selection acts most strongly on females. Here, we use a DNA–based study of parentage in the Gulf pipefish Syngnathus scovelli in order to show that sexual selection indeed acts more strongly on females than on males in this species. Moreover, the Gulf pipefish exhibits classical polyandry with the greatest asymmetry in reproductive roles (as quantified by variances in mating success) between males and females yet documented in any system. Thus, the intensity of sexual selection on females in pipefish rivals that of any other taxon yet studied.Large datasets are available through Proceedings B's partnership with DryadGenes related to the Drosophila melanogaster doublesex and Caenorhabditis elegans mab-3 genes are conserved in human. They are identified by a DNA-binding homology motif, the DM domain, and constitute a gene family (DMRTs). Unlike the invertebrate genes, whose role in the sex-determination process is essentially understood, the function of the different vertebrate DMRT genes is not as clear. Evidence has accumulated for the involvement of DMRT1 in male sex determination and differentiation. DMRT2 (known as terra in zebrafish) seems to be a critical factor for somitogenesis. To contribute to a better understanding of the function of this important gene family, we have analyzed DMRT1, DMRT2, and DMRT3 from the genome model organism Fugu rubripes and the medakafish, a complementary model organism for genetics and functional studies. We found conservation of synteny of human chromosome 9 in F. rubripes and an identical gene cluster organization of the DMRTs in both fish. Although expression analysis and gene linkage mapping in medaka exclude a function for any of the three genes in the primary step of male sex determination, comparison of F. rubripes and human sequences uncovered three putative regulatory regions that might have a role in more downstream events of sex determination and human XY sex reversal.To whom correspondence and reprint requests should be addressed.

Embryos were injected with graded doses of methyl testosterone (MT) prior to epiboly. The occurrence of sex-reversal, and the gonadosomatic index (GSI) were evaluated in adults. Primary germ cells were counted and gonad volumes calculated for larvae to determine if sex-reversal could be detected at an early life stage. Sex-reversal of genetic females to phenotypic males was observed at both life stages. The GSI for phenotypic females was greater than for phenotypic males, while the GSI in XX males was similar to XY males. MT appeared to reduce the GSI of XX females exposed to MT but not sex-reversed. Our results indicate that embryonic exposure to androgens influences sexual development in medaka. Utilizing the d-rR strain of medaka allows detection of an effect as early as 2 weeks after chemical exposure making this a useful tool to screen chemicals for effects on sexual differentiation.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

A variety of environmental chemicals are also active at sex steroid receptors and theoretically possess the potential to alter normal sexual differentiation in fish. However, in controlled environmental chemical exposures to date, only partial alterations of fish sexual phenotype have been observed. Here we report complete, permanent, and functional male-to-female sex reversal in the Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes, d-rR strain) after a onetime embryonic exposure to the xenoestrogen o, p'-DDT. d-rR strain medaka are strict gonochorists that possesses both sex-linked pigmentation, which distinguishes genotypic sex, and sexually dimorphic external secondary sexual characteristics, which distinguish phenotypic sex. We directly microinjected the xenoestrogen o, p'-DDT into the egg yolks of medaka at fertilization to parallel the maternal transfer of lipophilic contaminants to the embryo. At 10 weeks of age, microinjected medaka were examined for mortality and sex reversal. A calculated embryonic dose of 511 +/- 22 ng/egg o, p'-DDT (mean +/- standard error) resulted in 50% mortality. An embryonic exposure of 227 +/- 22 ng/egg o, p'-DDT resulted in 86% (6 of 7) sex reversal of genetic males to a female phenotype (XY females). XY females were distinguished by sex-linked male pigmentation accompanying female secondary sexual characteristics. Histologic examination of the gonads confirmed active ovaries in 100% of the XY females. In 10-day breeding trials in which XY females were paired with normal XY males, 50% of the XY females produced fertilized embryos; this represents a comparable breeding success rate to normal XX females. Fertilized eggs produced from XY females hatched to viable larvae. These results clearly indicate that a weakly estrogenic pesticide, o, p'-DDT, when presented during the critical period of gonadal development, can profoundly alter sexual differentiation.The effects of ovine-luteinizing hormone (oLH) or a synthetic analog of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, Des-Gly10[S-Ala6]-LHRH ethylamide acetate salt (LHRH-A), on the female phase of the protogynous Monopterus albus were investigated, and the plasma levels of androstenedione (Ad), testosterone (T), 11-oxotestosterone (KT), 11β-hydroxytestosterone (OHT), 17β-estradiol (E2) and progesterone were determined. In the postspawning stage, oLH induced precocious sex reversal in the gonad from female to male and increased plasma levels of Ad, T, KT and OHT. However, such oLH effects in M. albus females were slight at the early prespawning stage, and no significant signs of precocious sex reversal were found either in gonadal structure or in plasma hormones as those in postspawning treatment. After LHRH-A treatment of M. albus females in both postspawning and early prespawning stages, the gonadal structure remained "female type" with no sign of proliferation of either Leydig cells or male germ cells. The plasma levels of E2 were greatly increased after the treatment.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

At the postspawning stage, oLH induced a precocious sex reversal with marked proliferation of interstitial Leydig cells and development of spermatogonial cysts in the gonads, and enhanced in vitro production of unsaturated androgens. However, such oLH effects were insignificant in females during the early prespawning stage: some spermatogonial cysts appeared, but no proliferation of Leydig cells took place. During both the postspawning and early prespawning stages, LHRH-A stimulated growth of the oocytes with increased yolk content. Gonadal steroid metabolism by females at early prespawning stage was not affected by LHRH-A within the brief experimental period. In the postspawning period, LHRH-A caused a change in the in vitro steroidogenic profile from a postspawning pattern to that of a typical prespawning female pattern with increased production of estrogens and two unknown metabolites, and decreased production of 5α-androstan-3β-OH-17-one.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

In vitro steroid metabolisms varied with the developmental stages of the gonad. In the female stage, the major products were either 3β-hydroxy-5α-androstan-17-one or unidentified metabolites, depending on the season. In the males, 11-oxotestosterone was the major product during the prespawning, reproductively active period, while in other periods of the seasonal cycle, 5α-reduced metabolites were more abundant. In the intersexes, the steroidogenic pattern changed from a female to a male pattern, i.e., the production of 11-oxotestosterone increased and that of the unidentified metabolites decreased.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Ultrastructural features related to steroidogenesis have been identified in the interstitial Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, granulosa cells and thecal cells, and are especially abundant in the Leydig cells during the mid-intersexual phase. Steroidogenic ultrastructures in the Sertoli cells develop only during the maturation of the spermatogenic cysts, whereas in the granulosa and thecal cells, these features become obvious only during the maturation of the large oocytes. EM evidence also suggests a nutritive function for the Sertoli cells and the granulosa cells. Results of in vitro steroidogenic studies, using either testosterone or progesterone as a precursor, show a predominant conversion to androstenedione and 5α-reduced compounds, and suggest a change in biosynthesis from 5α-reduced products to androstenedione during sex reversal. 11-Ketotestosterone (11KT) has been identified, but not 11 β-hydroxytestosterone. Production of 11 KT is high in the late intersexual and the male phases, but a lack of a marked variation in 11KT production between the early and the mid-intersexual phase suggests that this steroid is not a trigger for natural sex reversal in Monopterus.This is a preview of subscription content, log in to check access.Axelrod LR, Matthijssen C, Goldzieher JW, Pulliam JE (1965) Definitive identification of microquantitities of radioactive steroids by recrystallization to constant specific activity.

View our privacy policyThe effect of mammalian luteinizing hormone on sex reversal of the rice-field eel, Monopterus albus (Zuiew) has been investigated by the administration of NIH-LH-S14 into female animals, the sexual status of which was first determined by biopsy of the gonad. Treatment of the female fish with mammalian-LH at a dosage of 3 μg/g-fish/injection, thrice weekly, or 1.5 μg/g-fish/injection daily, for a period of 7.58 wk produced the same effect on the ovary. In all treated fish there was great stimulation of the development of interstitial cells, which showed very intense reactions for 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. About 70% of the fish developed testicular lobules showing active spermatogenesis. In some fish, the only sign that showed that the gonad was an ovary at the time of biopsy were a few primary follicles. These results indicate that mammalian-LH is effective in stimulating in Monopterus, firstly, the development of static male germ-cells in the ovary to form testicular lobules with active spermatogenesis and, secondly, the proliferation of interstitial Leydig cells in the gonadal lamellae. Thus the pituitary of Monopterus may play an important role in the onset of natural sex reversal.Present address: Department of Zoology, The University, Hull, U.K.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Since previous findings indicated that steroid hormones may play some part in the process of sex reversal of Monopterus, an investigation on the role of sex steroid hormones was made using hormone administration together with biopsy study.Various androgens, including methyltestosterone, testosterone and 11-ketotestosterone, at different dosages failed to bring about precocious sex reversal in the female and no significant changes in the ovaries were observable after treatment. Methyltestosterone also failed to enhance the development of testicular lobules in the intersex animals. On the other hand, oestrogens injected into the intersex and male fish caused suppression of spermatogenesis and destruction of testicular lobules, but failed to cause the fish to change in the female direction.By the use of cyanoketone, an inhibitor of steroidogenesis, and the administration of methyltestosterone, it was demonstrated that androgens failed to bring about sex reversal even in the absence of endogenous oestrogens. Hence the failure of androgens to stimulate the development of male germ cells in the female phase is probably not due to any inhibitory effects by endogenous oestrogens. It is therefore concluded that sex steroids do not appear to play any primary role in the triggering of natural sex reversal of this protogynous fish.Present address: Department of Zoology, The University, Hull, U.

The incubations were analyzed for steroids by thin-layer chromatography, isotope dilution, and derivative formation techniques, and the radioactive products included progesterone, 17αOH-progesterone, androstenedione, testosterone, estradiol-17β, and estrone in addition to a number of unknown polar metabolites. Steroids produced by the gonads at various sexual phases were the same qualitatively, but the major sex steroids showed a shift in their production during sex reversal so that comparatively more estrogens were produced by the females, and, when structural transformation from ovary to testis commenced, androgen production increased markedly. The increase in androgen production appeared to be related to the development of the interstitial Leydig cells during the reversal of sex.Present address: Department of Zoology, University of Sheffield.Present address: Department of Zoology, University of Hull.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Consequently, sex reversals of 84 and 100%, respectively, were achieved in genetic males of the medaka. Partition of steroids recovered from the larvae revealed that two thirds of steroids retained in the larval body still remained in a free form. Total counts found in the gonad remained at a constant level of 3.5 – 5.5% of radioactivity recovered from the whole body irrespective of genetic sex. In the case of precocious maturation of the ovary, a high gonadal recovery rate of more than 10% was obtained. These facts suggest that active accumulation of estrogens may be occurring in the differentiating gonad of the larvae. Of the estrogens extracted in a free state, approximately 60% were proved to be estrone, and the remaining 40% estradiol, estriol, and an unknown component. Thus, conversion of estrone to estradiol was demonstrated in the larvae of the medaka during the period critical for sex differentiation. Moreover, on the basis of the recovery counts of the larvae, 1.8 × 10−2 μg estrone, and 1.1 × 10−2 μg diethylstilbestrol, respectively, were calculated as the oral dose of estrogen required for 100% induction of sex reversal in genetic males.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.
