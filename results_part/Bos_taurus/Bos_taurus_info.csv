32257095,"Seroprevalence of Foot and Mouth Disease Virus Infection in Some Wildlife and Cattle in Bauchi State, Nigeria.","Atuman YJ, Kudi CA, Abdu PA, Okubanjo OO, Abubakar A, Wungak Y, Ularamu HG",Vet Med Int. 2020 Mar 18;2020:3642793. doi: 10.1155/2020/3642793. eCollection 2020.,"Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is an important transboundary viral disease of both domestic and wild cloven-hoofed animals characterized by high morbidity with devastating consequence on the livestock worldwide. Despite the endemic nature of FMD in Nigeria, little is known about the epidemiology of the disease at the wildlife-livestock interface level. To address this gap, blood samples were collected between 2013 and 2015 from some wildlife and cattle, respectively, within and around the Yankari Game Reserve and Sumu Wildlife Park in Bauchi State, Nigeria. Wild animals were immobilized using a combination of etorphine hydrochloride (M99(R) Kruger-Med South Africa) at 0.5-2 mg/kg and azaperone (Stresnil(R), Janssen Pharmaceuticals (Pty.) Ltd., South Africa) at 0.1 mg/kg using a Dan-Inject(R) rifle (Dan-Inject APS, Sellerup Skovvej, Denmark) fitted with a 3 ml dart syringe and for reversal, naltrexone (Trexonil(R) Kruger-Med South Africa) at 1.5 mg IM was used, and cattle were restrained by the owners for blood collection. Harvested sera from blood were screened for presence of antibodies against the foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) using the PrioCHECK(R) 3ABC NSP ELISA kit, and positive samples were serotyped using solid-phase competitive ELISA, (IZSLER Brescia, Italy). Out of the 353 sera collected from cattle and wildlife 197 (65.7%) and 13 (24.5%) (P < 0.05), respectively, tested positive for antibodies to the highly conserved nonstructural 3ABC protein of FMDV by the FMDV-NS blocking ELISA. Classification of cattle into breed and sex showed that detectable antibodies to FMDV were higher (P < 0.05) in White Fulani 157 (72.8%) than in Red Bororo 23 (39.7%) and Sokoto Gudali 17 (33.3%) breeds of cattle, whereas in females, detectable FMDV antibodies were higher (P < 0.05) 150 (72.8%) than in males 47 (50.0%). In the wildlife species, antibodies to FMDV were detected in the waterbucks 2 (28.6%), elephant 1 (25.0%), wildebeests 4 (33.3%), and elands 6 (25.0%). Four serotypes of FMDV: O, A, SAT 1, and SAT 2 were detected from the 3ABC positive reactors in waterbucks, elephants, wildebeests, and elands. The results showed presence of antibodies to FMDV in some wildlife and cattle and suggested that wildlife could equally play an important role in the overall epidemiology of FMD in Nigeria. FMD surveillance system, control, and prevention program should be intensified in the study area."
31793061,Application of droplet digital PCR in diagnosing of X monosomy in mares.,"Szczerbal I, Nowacka-Woszuk J, Kopp-Kuhlman C, Mackowski M, Switonski M",Equine Vet J. 2020 Jul;52(4):627-631. doi: 10.1111/evj.13214. Epub 2020 Feb 12.,"BACKGROUND: X monosomy is the most common disorder of sex development in horses. Although cytogenetic analysis is still the gold standard in the diagnosis of equine X monosomy, novel molecular techniques are being sought to quickly and reliably detect this chromosome abnormality. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of a novel variant of the PCR technique-namely, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)-in the detection of X monosomy in mares. STUDY DESIGN: A proof of concept of the usefulness of ddPCR in diagnosing an abnormal number of X chromosomes in mares. METHODS: We examined an infertile mare using cytogenetic (fluorescent in situ hybridisation-FISH) and molecular (droplet digital PCR-ddPCR) techniques. The X chromosome copy number in ddPCR was estimated via detection of the AMELX gene copy number. In addition, 70 mares homozygous for X-linked microsatellite marker (LEX3) were examined by ddPCR. For all mares, a PCR search for the Y-linked SRY gene was also performed. RESULTS: Cytogenetic analysis and ddPCR gave concordant results, indicating pure X monosomy in the studied mare. Of the 70 additional mares examined by ddPCR, a single copy of the X chromosome was found in two cases. All mares were SRY-negative and thus both freemartinism, manifested by leucocyte XX/XY chimerism, and sex reversal syndrome (XX, SRY-positive) could be excluded. MAIN LIMITATIONS: The ddPCR approach does not allow for unequivocal identification of mosaicism (63,X/64,XX or 65,XXX/64,XX), but may give an indication that further cytogenetic analysis is necessary. CONCLUSION: The ddPCR approach appeared to be useful for diagnosing nonmosaic X monosomy in mares. If the number of X chromosome copies in a mare, as determined by ddPCR, differs from two (in our study, <1.8 or >2.2), additional cytogenetic investigation is recommended with the aim of detecting the mosaicism."
26218834,Interleukin-6 inhibits adrenal androgen release from bovine adrenal zona reticularis cells by inhibiting the expression of steroidogenic proteins.,"McIlmoil S, Call GB, Barney M, Strickland J, Judd AM",Domest Anim Endocrinol. 2015 Oct;53:108-23. doi: 10.1016/j.domaniend.2015.05.006. Epub 2015 Jun 9.,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is secreted by adrenocortical cells and modifies cortisol secretion. In this study, the effects of IL-6 on adrenal androgen release were investigated. The zona reticularis (ZR) was generally isolated from bovine adrenal glands by dissection. In select experiments, the intact adrenal cortex (ie, all 3 adrenocortical zones) was dissected from the adrenal glands. For androgen release experiments, ZR and intact adrenocortical cubes were dispersed into isolated cells, the cells cultured and exposed to IL-6 and/or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and androgen release determined by radioimmunoassay. Basal and ACTH-stimulated androgen release from the ZR was inhibited by IL-6 in a concentration-dependent (10-1000 pg/mL) and time-dependent (4-24 h) manner (P < 0.01 by 1-way analysis of variance and the Bonferroni test). In contrast, IL-6 increased basal and ACTH-stimulated androgen release from mixed adrenocortical cells (P < 0.01). The mechanism of IL-6 inhibition of androgen release was investigated by exposing ZR strips to IL-6 and measuring the expression of the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein of steroidogenic factors. Basal and ACTH-stimulated expression of the mRNA and protein for steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme, 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, steroid 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase/17,20 desmolase, and the nuclear factor steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), that stimulates steroidogenesis, were decreased by IL-6 (P < 0.01). In contrast IL-6 increased the mRNA and protein for dosage-sensitive sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia critical region, on chromosome X, gene 1 (DAX-1), a nuclear factor that inhibits steroidogenesis (P < 0.01). In summary, IL-6 decreased androgen release and the expression of steroidogenic factors in the ZR, and this decrease may be mediated in part through increasing DAX-1 and decreasing SF-1."
22813600,Evidence for almost complete sex-reversal in bovine freemartin gonads: formation of seminiferous tubule-like structures and transdifferentiation into typical testicular cell types.,"Harikae K, Tsunekawa N, Hiramatsu R, Toda S, Kurohmaru M, Kanai Y",J Reprod Dev. 2012;58(6):654-60. doi: 10.1262/jrd.2012-070. Epub 2012 Jul 20.,"During mammalian sex determination of XY fetuses, SRY induces SOX9 in Sertoli cells, resulting in formation of testes with seminiferous tubules, interstitial Leydig cells and peritubular myoid cells. Meanwhile XX fetuses without SRY develop ovaries. In cattle, most XX heifers born with a male twin, so-called freemartins, develop nonfunctioning ovaries and genitalia with an intersex phenotype. Interestingly, freemartins sometimes develop highly masculinized gonads with seminiferous tubule-like structures despite the absence of SRY. However, in these cases, the degree of masculinization in each gonadal somatic cell type is unclear. Here, we report a rare case of a freemartin Japanese black calf with almost complete XX sexreversal. Gross anatomical analysis of this calf revealed the presence of a pair of small testis-like gonads with rudimentary epididymides, in addition to highly masculinized genitalia including a pampiniform plexus, scrotum and vesicular gland. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses of these masculinized gonads revealed well-defined seminiferous tubule-like structures throughout the whole gonadal parenchyma. In epithelia of these tubules, SOX9-positive supporting cells (i.e., Sertoli cells) were found to be arranged regularly along the bases of tubules, and they were also positive for GDNF, one of the major factors for spermatogenesis. 3beta-HSD-positive cells (i.e., Leydig cells) and SMA-positive peritubular myoid cells were also identified around tubules. Therefore, for the first time, we found the transdifferentiation of ovarian somatic cells into all testicular somatic cell types in the XX freemartin gonads. These data strongly support the idea of a high sexual plasticity in the ovarian somatic cells of mammalian gonads."
22168143,Islet isolation from adult designated pathogen-free pigs: use of the newer bovine nervous tissue-free enzymes and a revised donor selection strategy would improve the islet graft function.,"Jin SM, Shin JS, Kim KS, Gong CH, Park SK, Kim JS, Yeom SC, Hwang ES, Lee CT, Kim SJ, Park CG",Xenotransplantation. 2011 Nov-Dec;18(6):369-79. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-3089.2011.00677.x.,"BACKGROUND: In clinical trials using adult porcine islet products, islets should be isolated from the designated pathogen-free (DPF) pigs under the current good manufacturing practice (GMP) regulations. Our previous studies suggested that male DPF pigs are better donors than retired breeder pigs and histomorphometrical parameters of donor pancreas predict the porcine islet quality. We aimed to investigate whether the use of the newer bovine nervous tissue-free enzymes and a revised donor selection strategy could improve the islet graft function in the context of islet isolation with DPF pigs. METHODS: Using 30 DPF pigs within a closed herd, we compared the islet yield of porcine islets isolated with Liberase PI (n = 11, as a historical control group), Liberase MTF C/T, which is a GMP-grade enzyme (n = 12), and CIzyme collagenase MA/BP protease (n = 7). We analyzed the relationship between the diabetes reversal rate of recipient NOD/SCID mice (n = 75) and histomorphometric parameters of each donor pancreas as well as donor characteristics. RESULTS: Proportion of islets larger than 200 mum from the biopsied donor pancreas (P = 0.006) better predicted islet yield than age (P = 0.760) or body weight (P = 0.371) of donor. The proportion of islets larger than 200 mum from the biopsied donor pancreas was not related to the sex of the donor miniature pig (P = 0.358). The islet yield obtained with the three enzymes did not differ, even after stratification of the donor with the histomorphometric parameters of the biopsied donor pancreas and the sex of donor. The use of the newer bovine nervous tissue-free enzymes (P < 0.001), a higher proportion of large islets in donor pancreas (P = 0.006), and a male sex of the donor (P = 0.025) were independent predictors of earlier diabetes reversal. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the newer bovine nervous tissue-free enzymes including a GMP-grade enzyme resulted in better islet quality than that of islet isolated using Liberase PI. To obtain high-quality islet from DPF pigs, the donor should be male pig and histomorphometrical parameters from donor pancreas should be considered."
20821638,Functional behavior and reproduction in androgenic sex reversed zebrafish (Danio rerio).,"Larsen MG, Baatrup E",Environ Toxicol Chem. 2010 Aug;29(8):1828-33. doi: 10.1002/etc.214.,"Endocrine-disrupting chemicals released into natural watercourses may cause biased sex ratios by sex reversal in fish populations. The present study investigated the androgenic sex reversal of zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to the androgenic compound 17beta-trenbolone (TB) and whether sex-changed females would revert to the female phenotype after cessation of TB exposure. 17beta-Trenbolone is a metabolite of trenbolone acetate, an anabolic steroid used as a growth promoter in beef cattle. 17beta-Trenbolone in runoff from cattle feedlots may reach concentrations that affect fish sexual development. Zebrafish were exposed to a concentration of 20 ng/L TB in a flow-through system for five months from egg until sexual maturity. This resulted in an all-male population. It was further found that all these phenotypic males displayed normal male courtship behavior and were able to reproduce successfully, implying that the sex reversal was complete and functional. None of the phenotypic males developed into females after six months in clean water, demonstrating that androgenic sex reversal of zebrafish is irreversible."
18851760,New insights into SRY regulation through identification of 5' conserved sequences.,"Ross DG, Bowles J, Koopman P, Lehnert S",BMC Mol Biol. 2008 Oct 14;9:85. doi: 10.1186/1471-2199-9-85.,"BACKGROUND: SRY is the pivotal gene initiating male sex determination in most mammals, but how its expression is regulated is still not understood. In this study we derived novel SRY 5' flanking genomic sequence data from bovine and caprine genomic BAC clones. RESULTS: We identified four intervals of high homology upstream of SRY by comparison of human, bovine, pig, goat and mouse genomic sequences. These conserved regions contain putative binding sites for a large number of known transcription factor families, including several that have been implicated previously in sex determination and early gonadal development. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal potentially important SRY regulatory elements, mutations in which might underlie cases of idiopathic human XY sex reversal."
12727972,N-terminal proopiomelanocortin acts as a mitogen in adrenocortical tumor cells and decreases adrenal steroidogenesis.,"Fassnacht M, Hahner S, Hansen IA, Kreutzberger T, Zink M, Adermann K, Jakob F, Troppmair J, Allolio B",J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2003 May;88(5):2171-9. doi: 10.1210/jc.2002-021318.,"There is evidence that proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptides other than ACTH are involved in pituitary-dependent adrenal growth. We have synthesized the human N-terminal POMC fragment 1-28-POMC with the disulfide bridges in the correct position between cysteine residues 2-24 and 8-20 and studied the activity of these peptides in adrenocortical tumor cells in vitro. 1-28-POMC stimulated cell proliferation in human NCI-h295 and mouse Y-1 adrenal cancer cell lines and also in primary cultures of bovine adrenocortical cells in a concentration-dependent manner. 1-28-POMC led to rapid activation of the MAPKs extracellular signal-regulated kinases-1 and -2, but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38, pathways. Steroid hormone production (cortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) in NCI-h295 cells was decreased by 1-28-POMC in a concentration-dependent fashion. However, protein levels of important regulators of steroidogenesis [steroidogenic factor-1, DAX-1 (dosage-sensitive sex reversal-adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X-chromosome 1), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, and cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme] remained unaffected by 1-28-POMC treatment. Our results provide evidence that synthetic 1-28-POMC induces adrenal tumor cell proliferation, inhibits adrenal steroidogenesis, and mediates its action by signaling via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. The distinct roles of 1-28-POMC and ACTH in the regulation of adrenal growth and steroidogenesis suggest that the adrenal cortex is under the dual opposing control of fragments from the same mother peptide POMC."
8641682,H-Y antigens.,Muller U,Hum Genet. 1996 Jun;97(6):701-4. doi: 10.1007/BF02346175.,"H-Y antigen is defined as a male histocompatibility antigen that causes rejection of male skin grafts by female recipients of the same inbred strain of rodents. Male-specific, or H-Y antigen(s), are also detected by cytotoxic T cells and antibodies. H-Y antigen appears to be an integral part of the membrane of most male cells. In addition, H-Y antibodies detect a soluble form of H-Y that is secreted by the testis. The gene (Smcy/SMCY) coding for H-Y antigen detected by T cells has been cloned. It is expressed ubiquitously in male mice and humans, and encodes an epitope that triggers a specific T-cell response in vitro. Additional epitopes coded for by different Y-chromosomal genes are probably required in vivo for the rejection of male grafts by female hosts. The molecular nature of H-Y antigen detected by antibodies on most male cells is not yet known. Testis-secreted, soluble H-Y antigen, however, was found to be identical to Mullerian-inhibiting substance (MIS). MIS cross-reacts with H-Y antibodies and identical findings were obtained for soluble H-Y antigen and MIS, i.e., secretion by testicular Sertoli and, to a lesser degree, ovarian cells, binding to a gonad-specific receptor, induction of gonadal sex reversal in vitro and, in cattle, in vivo. H-Y antisera also detect a molecule or molecules associated with the heterogametic sex in nonmammalian vertebrates. Molecular data on this antigen or antigens are not yet available."
8835530,Genetic mapping of the autosomal region involved in XX sex-reversal and horn development in goats.,"Vaiman D, Koutita O, Oustry A, Elsen JM, Manfredi E, Fellous M, Cribiu EP",Mamm Genome. 1996 Feb;7(2):133-7. doi: 10.1007/s003359900033.,"Contrary to other genetic disorders, the genetic study of sex determination anomalies in humans stumbles over the difficulty in observing large pedigrees. In goats, abnormalities in sex determination are intimately linked to a dominant Mendelian gene coding for the ""polled"" (hornless) character, which could render this species an interesting animal model for the rare human cases of SRY-negative XX males. In this report, we describe genetic linkage between the polled/intersex synchome (PIS) and four microsatellite markers of the distal region of goat Chromosome 1 (CHI1), quite distinct from the bovine ""polled"" region. According to comparative mapping data, no sex-determining gene has been described so far in homologous regions in the human. This genetic localization constitutes a first step towards identifying a new autosomal sex-determining gene in mammals."
8469238,"Mullerian inhibiting substance requires its N-terminal domain for maintenance of biological activity, a novel finding within the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily.","Wilson CA, di Clemente N, Ehrenfels C, Pepinsky RB, Josso N, Vigier B, Cate RL",Mol Endocrinol. 1993 Feb;7(2):247-57. doi: 10.1210/mend.7.2.8469238.,"Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS)/anti-Mullerian hormone is a differentiation factor that causes regression of the Mullerian duct in the developing male fetus and an apparent sex reversal of the fetal ovary when inappropriately exposed to it. The purified product is a 140-kilodalton glycoprotein composed of two identical subunits. We show that a C-terminal fragment of MIS, which shares homology with transforming growth factor-beta, causes regression of the Mullerian duct and inhibits the biosynthesis of aromatase in the fetal ovary. However, both activities are enhanced dramatically by addition of the N-terminal portion of MIS. Under conditions where potentiation occurs, the N- and C-terminal domains of MIS reassociate. These results indicate that the N-terminus of MIS, unlike that of the other members of the transforming growth factor-beta family, plays a role in maintaining the biological activity of the C-terminus."
8430080,SRY recognizes conserved DNA sites in sex-specific promoters.,"Haqq CM, King CY, Donahoe PK, Weiss MA",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Feb 1;90(3):1097-101. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.3.1097.,"Formation of male-specific structures and regression of female primordia are regulated in early male embryogenesis by SRY, a single-copy gene on the Y chromosome. Assignment of SRY as the testis-determining factor in eutherian mammals is supported by molecular analysis of cytogenetic sex reversal (i.e., XX males and XY females) and by complementary studies of transgenic murine models. Here we characterize the putative DNA-binding domain of SRY, which contains a conserved sequence motif shared by high-mobility group nuclear proteins and a newly recognized class of transcription factors. The SRY DNA-binding domain specifically recognizes with nanomolar affinity proximal upstream elements (designated SRYe) in the promoters of the sex-specific genes encoding P450 aromatase and Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS). P450 aromatase catalyzes the conversion of testosterone to estradiol, and in the male embryo its expression is down-regulated. Conversely, MIS is expressed in the male embryo to induce testicular differentiation and regression of female reproductive ducts. SRYe-binding activity is observed in nuclear extracts obtained from embryonic urogenital ridge immediately preceding morphologic testicular differentiation. Our results support the hypothesis that SRY directly controls male development through sequence-specific regulation of target genes."
8428509,A balanced autosomal reciprocal translocation in an azoospermic bull.,"Ansari HA, Jung HR, Hediger R, Fries R, Konig H, Stranzinger G",Cytogenet Cell Genet. 1993;62(2-3):117-23. doi: 10.1159/000133453.,"This appears to be the first reported case of a bull with a balanced autosomal reciprocal translocation associated with azoospermia. The analysis includes somatic chromosome banding, conventional meiotic analysis, and electron microscopy of synaptonemal complexes (SCs). The karyotype of the bull was found to be 60,XY,rcp(8;13)(q11;q24). Electron microscopy of SCs in microspread pachytene spermatocytes revealed a high incidence of terminal asynapsis of the smallest arm of the quadrivalent. Most quadrivalents with such asynapsis and few with nonhomologous synapsis showed associations with the XY sex bivalent, leading to complete meiotic arrest at late pachynema. Except for one diakinetic cell, no diplotene and subsequent stages were encountered in air-dried meiotic preparations. The presence of degenerating primary spermatocytes in SC preparations, as well as in testicular sections, and the absence of spermatozoa in ejaculates confirm the chromosomally derived male sterility of the bull. X-chromosome reactivation, evidenced by the cytomorphological reversal of associated sex bivalents, appeared to be the initial step in the degeneration of spermatocytes. Consequently, the formation of a separate, fully developed XY body, which was previously demonstrated on the periphery of spermatocyte nuclei in fertile bulls, could not be attained in this case. Extensive end-to-end association of autosomal bivalents in meiotically arrested, as well as degenerating, spermatocytes was a consistent and unique observation of this study. Such associations may lead to enhanced reactivation of the X chromosome."
1782459,[Contribution of experimental intersexuality in chickens to the problem of gonadal differentiation and its abnormalities in amniotic vertebrates].,"Maraud R, Rashedi M, Vergnaud O, Audine M, Piet M, Castet MC, Stoll R",Bull Assoc Anat (Nancy). 1991 Mar;75(228):21-8.,"The grafting of embryonic testes to chick embryos realizes an experimental model which is near the spontaneous situation of the cattle ""free-martin"". It allows to obtain a masculinization of female host embryos developing in some cases up to a total and definitive reversal of sex differentiation. Indeed, it is possible, by this way to obtain testes induced under the influence of substance(s) secreted by the grafts which determine epigenetically a sexual phenotype opposite to the genotype of the host embryos. The analysis of such testis morphogenesis shows that it results from an inhibitory mechanism. Some experimental data strongly suggest to ascribe it to the anti-Mullerian hormone secreted by the graft. The ovotestes and testes observed in adult treated animals present various degrees of development, especially at the level of seminiferous tubules in which the spermatogenesis, when present, may be completed until spermatozoa. Some gonadal abnormalities interesting genetically female human beings, like a majority of the hermaphrodites, or certain XX men, are discussed at the light of these experimental data."

When one species is used as a reference, cytometric readings from two or more different species can be compared to obtain relative percent DNA or DNA indices. Differences in DNA from the male and female of the same species also can be measured. The method allows rapid screening of chromosomal abnormalities among large clinical populations, and evaluation of errors of sex determination such as XY sex reversal."

The calves were produced in the Ankole District of south-western Uganda as a part of a beef cattle research program designed to provide information to support a commercial ranching development scheme in an area that had been cleared of the tsetse fly. Breed of sire effects were significant for birth and weaning weight, and breed of dam effects were significant for birth, weaning and 12-mo weight. Breed of sire and breed of dam effects that were significant showed the Boran breed to have higher values for all traits except breed of dam effects on birth weight; calves with Red Poll dams were 3.6 kg heavier (P less than .01) at birth than calves with Boran dams. Steers were significantly heavier than heifers at all ages except birth. Young cows (3 and 4 yr old) and old cows (9 yr old and older) produced calves that weighed significantly less at weaning, 12 mo and 18 mo than calves with dams that were 5 through 8 yr old. Heterosis effects were significant for weights at weaning, 12, 18, 24 and 30 mo of age; generally, heterosis effects on weight increased with age. Heterosis effects approached significance for survival from birth to 30 mo. Additive maternal effects were significant for birth weight; crossbred calves with Boran dams weighted 6.0 kg less at birth than crossbred calves with Red Poll dams. There was a reversal of the reciprocal effect between prenatal and postnatal gains; crossbred calves with Boran dams weighed 7.1 kg more at weaning than crossbred calves with Red Poll dams. Examination of additive direct effects showed the Boran breed to be significantly heavier than the Red Poll breed for birth weight and weaning weight. Additive direct effects showed the Boran breed to have generally higher (P greater than .05) values than the Red Poll breed for most other traits analyzed. Differences between straightbreds of the Boran and Red Poll breeds, which reflect differences in additive maternal and additive direct effects combined, significantly favored the Boran breed for weaning weight and 18-mo weight and favored (P less than .05) the Boran breed for all other traits except birth weight. It was concluded that the Red Poll breed had higher values for additive maternal effects for birth weight than the Boran breed in the climatic and nutritive environment in which this experiment was conducted; for most other traits evaluated, the Boran breed generally had higher values for additive maternal and higher values for additive direct effects than the Red Poll breed."
