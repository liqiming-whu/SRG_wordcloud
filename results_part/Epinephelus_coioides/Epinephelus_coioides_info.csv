32316525,Integration of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq Unravels Chromatin Accessibility during Sex Reversal in Orange-Spotted Grouper (Epinephelus coioides).,"Wu X, Yang Y, Zhong C, Guo Y, Wei T, Li S, Lin H, Liu X",Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Apr 17;21(8). pii: ijms21082800. doi: 10.3390/ijms21082800.,"Chromatin structure plays a pivotal role in maintaining the precise regulation of gene expression. Accessible chromatin regions act as the binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) and cis-elements. Therefore, information from these open regions will enhance our understanding of the relationship between TF binding, chromatin status and the regulation of gene expression. We employed an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA-seq analyses in the gonads of protogynous hermaphroditic orange-spotted groupers during sex reversal to profile open chromatin regions and TF binding sites. We focused on several crucial TFs, including ZNF263, SPIB, and KLF9, and analyzed the networks of TF-target genes. We identified numerous transcripts exhibiting sex-preferred expression among their target genes, along with their associated open chromatin regions. We then investigated the expression patterns of sex-related genes as well as the mRNA localization of certain genes during sex reversal. We found a set of sex-related genes that-upon further study-might be identified as the sex-specific or cell-specific marker genes that trigger sex reversal. Moreover, we discovered the core genes (gnas, ccnb2, and cyp21a) of several pathways related to sex reversal that provide the guideposts for future study."
32194632,Beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Genes in Orange-Spotted Grouper (Epinephelus coioides): Genome-Wide Identification and Expression Analysis During Sex Reversal.,"Xiao L, Guo Y, Wang D, Zhao M, Hou X, Li S, Lin H, Zhang Y",Front Genet. 2020 Mar 4;11:161. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2020.00161. eCollection 2020.,"Beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (beta-HSDs) are a group of steroidogenic enzymes that are involved in steroid biosynthesis and metabolism, and play a crucial role in mammalian physiology and development, including sex determination and differentiation. In the present study, a genome-wide analysis identified the numbers of beta-hsd genes in orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) (19), human (Homo sapiens) (22), mouse (Mus musculus) (24), chicken (Gallus gallus) (16), xenopus (Xenopus tropicalis) (24), coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) (17), spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) (14), zebrafish (Danio rerio) (19), fugu (Takifugu rubripes) (19), tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) (19), medaka (Oryzias latipes) (19), stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) (17) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) (27) samples. A comparative analysis revealed that the number of beta-hsd genes in teleost fish was no greater than in tetrapods due to gene loss followed by a teleost-specific whole-genome duplication event. Based on transcriptome data from grouper brain and gonad samples during sex reversal, six beta-hsd genes had relatively high expression levels in the brain, indicating that these genes may be required for neurogenesis or the maintenance of specific biological processes in the brain. In the gonad, two and eight beta-hsd genes were up- and downregulated, respectively, indicating their important roles in sex reversal. Our results demonstrated that beta-hsd genes may be involved in the sex reversal of grouper by regulating the synthesis and metabolism of sex steroid hormones."

Epub 2020 Jan 30.,"Vasa and dazl genes have been reported to play pivotal roles in germ cell development and differentiation both in vertebrates and invertebrates; however, little is known about their functions in germ cell differentiation during gametogenesis and sex reversal in hermaphroditic fish. In the present study, vasa (Ecvasa) and dazl (Ecdazl) cDNA were cloned from orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides). The full-length cDNA sequences of Ecvasa and Ecdazl were 2162 and 2101 bp, and encoded 646 and 214 amino acid residues, respectively. Reversal transcription PCR showed that Ecvasa and Ecdazl mRNA were highly expressed in the gonads. Further, in situ hybridization revealed that Ecvasa and Ecdazl RNA were dynamically expressed in germ cells at different stages during oogenesis, sex reversal, and spermatogenesis in orange-spotted grouper. Intriguingly, the signals for Ecvasa and Ecdazl mRNA became weaker in oocytes of ovo-testes gonads, indicating that the expression of germ cell genes could be suppressed in oocytes during sex reversal in the orange-spotted grouper. Our study is the first time to describe the expression profiles of vasa and dazl mRNA in germ cells during gametogenesis and sex reversal in the orange-spotted grouper. These findings will provide new insights into understanding the mechanisms through which vasa and dazl regulate germ cell differentiation in hermaphrodite fish species."

Epub 2019 Dec 28.,"Cyp19a1a is a key gene responsible for the production of estradiol-17beta (E2), the main functional estrogen and a major downstream regulator of reproduction in teleost fish. It is widely known that CYP19 gene expression, aromatase activity, and E2 production can influence gonadal differentiation and sex reversal in teleost fish, but the feedback mechanisms whereby E2 regulates cyp19a1a remain poorly understood, especially regarding the potential roles of endogenous small RNA molecules (miRNAs). Here, we identified miR-26a-5p as a regulatory factor of its predicted target gene (cyp19a1a). In vitro and in vivo studies showed that miR-26a-5p can decrease cyp19a1a expression. Furthermore, high doses of E2 act as a repressor of miR-26a-5p. This study proposes a regulatory feedback loop whereby E2 regulates cyp19a1a through miR-26a-5p, and suggests that this positive feedback is an important aspect of the control of E2 production."

Epub 2019 Mar 23.,"Stem-loop binding protein (SLBP) binds a stem-loop structure of the mRNA, which is important for the stability of histone mRNAs and translation process. In the present study, two slbp cDNAs (Ecslbp1 and Ecslbp2) were cloned from a protogynous hermaphroditic orange-spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides. Ecslbp1 cDNA contained a 678 base pair (bp) open reading frame (ORF), encoding a predicted polypeptide of 225 amino acids. Ecslbp2 cDNA contained a 1041bp, encoding a predicted protein of 346 amino acids. The result of real-time PCR revealed that Ecslbp2 mRNA was exclusively detected in the ovary. Moreover, it was found to be restricted to oocytes according to in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis. Ecslbp2 was found to be hardly detected in gonia and significantly increase in the cytoplasm of primary-growth stage oocytes, but decreased during the process of vitellogenesis. Interestingly, Ecslbp2 expression centralized as a perinuclear speckle in early-primary-growth stage oocytes, which appeared to form into the Balbiani body (Bb) in late-primary-growth stage oocytes. These data indicated that Ecslbp2 might play an important role in the process of oocyte development, and could serve as an oocyte-specific molecular marker for the study of ovary development and sex reversal in groupers."

Epub 2019 Feb 20.,"Socially controlled sex change in teleosts is a dramatic example of adaptive reproductive plasticity. In many cases, the occurrence of sex change is triggered by a change in the social context, such as the disappearance of the dominant individual. The orange-spotted grouper Epinephelus coioides is a typical protogynous hermaphrodite fish that changes sex from female to male and remains male throughout its life span. In this study, male-to-female sex reversal in male Epinephelus coioides was successfully induced by social isolation. The body length and mass, gonadal change, serum sex steroid hormone levels and sex-related gene expression patterns during the process of socially controlled male-to-female sex reversal in E. coioides were systematically examined. This report investigates the physiological mechanisms of the socially controlled male-to-female sex reversal process in a protogynous hermaphrodite grouper species. The results enable us to study the physiological control of sex change, not only from female to male, but also from male to female."

Epub 2018 Dec 28.,"The orange-spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides, is a marine protogynous hermaphrodite fish of commercial importance. There are many examples of sex change species among marine fish, but the molecular basis for the sex change is still unknown. Gonadal expression patterns of the dmrts and foxls genes in E. coioides have pointed to sexual dimorphism in this species and it has been shown that mRNA levels of dmrts and foxls to vary significantly during reproduction cycles. The steroid 17alpha-methyltestosterone was used to induce sex reversal in these fish, during which dmrts and foxls levels changed significantly and subsequently reverted to normal when 17alpha-methyltestosterone was withdrawn. Interestingly, the expression of dmrt2b and dmrt3 was not affected by this steroid. We speculate that the role of foxl2 in reproduction may be conserved via regulation of early differentiation of the ovary by the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis, and dmrt2 may have a significant role in premature ovarian differentiation and maintenance in E. coioides. dmrt1 and foxl3 played a role in the development of the testes and are believed to be potential male regulatory genes."

In this study, orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) fry were treated with letrozole (an aromatase inhibitor, AI), 17alpha-methyltestosterone (MT), or MT and 17beta-estradiol (E2) simultaneously, during the period of gonadal formation and sex differentiation. MT feeding at 50 days after hatching resulted in gonadal dysgenesis, which could be rescued by E2 supplementation. Different doses of AI treatment led to different phenotypes: undifferentiated gonads were maintained in the AI group fed a low dose (5 mg/kg diet), whereas female-to-male sex reversal was observed in the AI group fed a high dose (100 mg/kg diet). MT and MT + E2 treatment could induce female-to-male sex reversal during sex differentiation (90 days after hatching). The expression of female pathway genes was suppressed, while the expression of genes in the male pathway was up-regulated in the MT + E2 group. Consistent with the expression of sex-related genes, the serum 11- ketotestosterone level was also upregulated in MT and MT + E2 group. Finally, we examined the expression of male-specific mark (DMRT1) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen in MT and MT + E2 induced sex reversal, and the result indicated that male germ cells and somatic cells may origin from the gonium and proliferative somatic cells surrounding the efferent duct, respectively. Overall, our data suggested that estrogen acts as a natural inducer of female differentiation, and that the co-administration of estrogen and androgen during sex differentiation leads to a male sex fate in the protogynous orange-spotted grouper."

Gonadal histology showed that MT feeding induced a precocious sex reversal from immature ovaries to testes, bypassing the formation of an ovarian cavity, and MT-feeding withdrawal led to an ovarian fate. In both the MT feeding and MT-feeding withdrawal phases, cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily B (cyp11b) gene expression and serum 11-KT levels were not significantly changed, suggesting that the MT-treated fish did not generate endogenous steroids, even though active spermatogenesis occurred. Finally, by tracing doublesex-expressing and Mab-3-related transcription factor 1 (dmrt1)-expressing cells and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase 2-deoxyuridine, 5-triphosphate nick end labeling) assays, we found that the efferent duct formed first, and then, the germ cells and somatic cells of the testicular tissue were generated around the efferent duct during MT-feeding-induced precocious sex reversal. Collectively, our findings provide insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying sex reversal induced by exogenous hormones during sex differentiation in the protogynous orange-spotted grouper."

The orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides), a teleost fish, functions first as females and later as a male and is an ideal model to investigate the regulation of sexual fate. Here, we report female-to-male sex reversal in juvenile orange-spotted groupers caused by overexpressing anti-Mullerian hormone (Amh). Tissue distribution analyses showed that amh and amhrII primarily expressed in the gonad, and expression level in the testis was much higher than that in the ovary. In gonads, the expression of amh was located in the Sertoli cells around spermatogonia of the testis and in the zona pellucida of the mature ovary, and the expression of amhrII was located in the Sertoli cells of the testis and in the oocytes of the ovary. Decrease in female-related genes and serum 17beta-estradiol level, increase in male-related genes and serum 11-ketotestosterone, ovarian regression, and spermatogonia proliferation were observed during plasmid feeding experiment. These results illustrate that amh overexpression plasmid feeding can induce a female-to-male transition in grouper."

Treatment with 17-methyltestosterone (MT) has been widely used to induce a male fate, but the molecular and cellular processes underlying sex changes induced by MT treatments and the withdrawal of MT are not well studied. In this study, we systematically investigated gonadal histology, gene expression profiles, sex steroid hormone levels, and cellular changes during sex changes induced by MT-feeding and MT-feeding withdrawal in the protogynous orange-spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides. Based on gonadal histology, we demonstrated that MT-feeding-induced sex reversal can be divided into early and late phases: in the early phase, male and female germ cells coexist, and MT-feeding withdrawal leads to a female fate; in the late phase, only male germ cells are observed, and MT-feeding withdrawal does not reverse the process, leading to a male fate. In both the early and late phases, cytochrome P450 family19 subfamily A member 1 (cyp19a1a) gene expression increased in response to MT-feeding withdrawal. Finally, by tracing doublesex- and Mab-3-related transcription factor 1 (dmrt1)-expressing cells, we found that gonia-like cells in the germinal epithelium might be the major germ cell sources for developing testes during sex reversal. Collectively, our findings provide insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying sex changes induced by exogenous hormones."

In the present study, a protogynous hermaphroditic orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) dnd homologue (Ecdnd) was identified and characterized. Quantitative real-time PCR and in situ hybridization analysis revealed a dynamic and sexually dimorphic expression pattern in PGCs and germ cells of gonads. During sex changing, the Ecdnd transcript sharply increased in early transitional gonad, reached the highest level at late transitional gonad stage, and decreased after testis maturation. Visualization of zebrafish PGCs by injecting with RFP-Ecdnd-3'UTR RNA and GFP-zfnanos3-3'UTR RNA confirmed importance of Ecdnd 3'UTR for the PGC distribution. In addition, knockdown of EcDnd by using antisense morpholinos (MO) caused the ablation of PGCs in orange-spotted grouper. Therefore, the current data indicate that Ecdnd is essential for PGCs survival and may serve as a useful germ cell marker during gametogenesis in hermaphroditic grouper."

StAR (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein), transferring the cholesterol from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner membrane, is the rate-limiting factor of steroidogenesis. 3betaHSD (3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Delta5-Delta4 isomerase), converting Delta5-steroids into Delta4-steroids, is an important oxidoreductase in steroidogenesis. In the present study, StAR and 3betaHSD1 were cloned and characterized from protogynous orange-spotted grouper. StAR cDNA contains an 861bp open reading frame (ORF), encoding a predicted protein of 286 amino acids, and the ORF of 3betaHSD1 was 1125bp, encoding a predicted protein of 374 amino acids. The transcript of StAR was mainly expressed in gonad, while 3betaHSD1 mRNA was predominantly detected in brain and gonad. In the previous study, we found the expression of GnIH mRNA level in male, as well as in 17 alpha-methyltestosterone (MT)-induced male fish was significantly higher than in female fish, this indicating that GnIH/GnIHR signaling might be involved in the regulation of sex reversal and male maintenance. In order to figure out the function of GnIH in steroidogenesis, the expression of StAR and 3betaHSD1 regulated by GnIH was examined. In vitro study showed that treatment of cultured ovary fragments with gGnIH peptides significantly stimulated the expression of StAR and 3betaHSD1. In addition, the mRNA levels of StAR and 3betaHSD1 were significantly increased after intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) with gGnIH peptides. Moreover, during MT-induced sex change from female to male, the levels of StAR mRNA significantly increased by 5.2, 24.8 and 353.5 folds, and that of 3betaHSD1 mRNA by 3.5, 32.5 and 55.4 folds at the 2nd, 4th and 6th week after MT implantation, respectively.

In protogynous hermaphroditic orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides), the GnIH/GnIHR signaling pathway and its reproductive function have not been addressed yet. In this study, GnIH and GnIHR in orange-spotted grouper were characterized. gGnIH possessed three putative peptides (gGnIH-I, -II, -III), while gGnIHR showed the characteristics of G protein-coupled receptor and was clustered with GPR147. Functional assays demonstrated that three synthetic gGnIH peptides significantly decreased the forskolin-induced CRE promoter activity, but only gGnIH-I could significantly decrease SRE promoter activity in COS-7 cells transfected with gGnIHR. During the process of ovarian differentiation and development, gGnIH mRNA level in hypothalamus was low at the gonadal primordium stage with gonia, then increased significantly at the early differentiated gonad with primary growth oocytes, while decreased significantly at the developing gonads with cortical-alveolus and vitellogenic stage oocytes. During MT-induced sex reversal, gGnIH mRNA level in hypothalamus increased significantly when the fish completely reversed from female to male. However, gGnIHR mRNA level in pituitary decreased significantly in intersex and completely reversed male fish. Intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of three gGnIH peptides significantly decreased GnRH1 mRNA levels in hypothalamus, and gGnIH-II significantly inhibited synthesis of LHbeta in pituitary. In summary, we firstly identified the GnIH/GnIHR signal in protogynous orange-spotted grouper, which might be involved in the regulation of the reproductive function of sex differentiation, gonadal development and sex reversal via regulating the synthesis of both GnRH and GtH."

The present study reports the cloning of the cDNA sequence of the ar in the orange-spotted grouper, with high expression in testis and relatively low in subdivision of brain areas. The cDNA sequence of ar was 2358 bp, encoding a protein of 759 amino acids (aa). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the ar cDNA sequence was closely related to that of threespot wrasse (Halichoeres trimaculatus) and medaka (Oryzias latipes) arbeta. As deduced from the phylogenetic tree and the high amino acid identity with the ARbeta subtype of other teleosts, grouper ar seems to be more closely related to the beta than the alpha subtype cloned to date. In the first week after 17alpha-methyltestosterone (MT) implantation, the transcript levels of ar in the hypothalamus declined significantly, and consistently stayed at low level expression to the second week, but increased back to the control levels in the third and fourth week. In the gonad, the mRNA expression of ar was not changed in the first week compared with the control, but increased significantly in the second week, consistently reached the highest level in the third week, dropped slightly but still higher than that of the control in the fourth week. The expression pattern of ar in hypothalamus and gonad during MT-induced sex reversal suggests the involvement of ar in regulating this process in the orange-spotted grouper. The present study provides the data of the changes in the mRNA levels of ar during MT-induced sex reversal in detail to help understand the complicated signals under sex reversal."

In this study, we cloned and characterized a beta-defensin from pituitary cDNA library of a protogynous hermaphroditic orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides). Interestingly, the beta-defensin was shown to be dominantly expressed in pituitary and testis by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, and its transcript level is significantly upregulated in reproduction organs from intersexual gonad to testis during the natural and artificial sex reversal. Promoter sequence and the responsible activity region analyses revealed the pituitary-specific POU1F1a transcription binding site and testis-specific SRY responsible site, and demonstrated that the pituitary-specific POU1F1a transcription binding site that locates between -180 and -208 bp is the major responsible region of grouper beta-defensin promoter activity. Immunofluorescence localization observed its pituicyte expression in pituitary and spermatogonic cell expression in testis. Moreover, both in vitro antibacterial activity assay of the recombinant beta-defensin and in vivo embryo microinjection of the beta-defensin mRNA were shown to be effective in killing gram-negative bacteria. And, its antiviral role was also demonstrated in EPC cells transfected with the beta-defensin construct. Additionally, the antibacterial activity was sensitive to concentrations of Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+) and Mg(2+). The above intriguing findings strongly suggest that the fish beta-defensin might play significant roles in both innate immunity defense and reproduction endocrine regulation."

The core mature peptide (Kiss2-10) of grouper Kiss2 shared high similarity to other KISS orthologs. In phylogenetic analyses, the grouper Kiss was clustered with the teleost Kiss2 clade and termed grouper kiss2. The predicted amino acid sequence of grouper kiss1ra contained three putative glycosylation sites at its N-terminus, showing high similarity to that of other teleosts. Synthesized Kiss2-10 was able to functionally interact with Kiss1ra in cultured COS-7 cells to trigger downstream signaling. Both kiss2 and kiss1ra mRNAs were expressed in all tissues examined, with highest levels in the olfactory bulb and moderate levels in the hypothalamus among brain areas and highest levels in ovary among peripheral tissues. Intraperitoneal injection of Kiss2-10 significantly increased gnrh1 mRNA levels in hypothalamus and follicle-stimulating hormone beta (fshb) mRNA levels in the pituitary at 6 and 12 h postinjection. During the process of sex reversal induced by 17 alpha-methyltestosterone (MT), kiss2 and kiss1ra mRNA expression were significantly decreased in the first week, but kiss2 increased in the fourth week, in accordance with the expression pattern of gnrh1 mRNA in the grouper hypothalamus. This is the first description of the Kiss2/Kiss1ra system during MT-induced sex reversal in orange-spotted grouper."
17436330,Differential expression and dynamic changes of SOX3 during gametogenesis and sex reversal in protogynous hermaphroditic fish.,"Yao B, Zhou L, Wang Y, Xia W, Gui JF",J Exp Zool A Ecol Genet Physiol. 2007 Apr 1;307(4):207-19. doi: 10.1002/jez.361.,"SOX3 has been suggested to play significant roles in gametogenesis and gonad differentiation of vertebrates, but the exact cellular localization evidence is insufficient and controversial. In this study, a protogynous hermaphrodite fish Epinephelus coioides is selected to analyze EcSox3 differential expression and the expression pattern in both processes of oogenesis and spermatogenesis by utilizing the advantages that gonad development undergoes transition from ovary to intersexual gonad and then to testis, and primordial germ cells and different stage cells during oogenesis and spermatogenesis are synchronously observed in the transitional gonads. The detailed and clear immunofluoresence localization indicates that significantly differential expression and dynamic changes of Sox3 occur in the progresses of gametogenesis and sex reversal, and EcSOX3 protein exists in the differentiating primordial germ cells, oogonia, and different stage oocytes of ovaries, and also in the differentiating primordial germ cells and the Sertoli cells of testis. One important finding is that the EcSox3 expression is a significant time point for enterable gametogenesis of primordial germ cells because EcSOX3 is obviously expressed and localized in primordial germ cells. As EcSox3 continues to express, the EcSOX3-positive primordial germ cells develop toward oogonia and then oocytes, whereas when EcSox3 expression is ceased, the EcSOX3-positive primordial germ cells develop toward spermatogonia. Therefore, the current finding of EcSOX3 in the differentiating primordial germ cells again confirms the potential regulatory role in oogenesis and germ cell differentiation. The data further suggest that SOX3, as a transcription factor, might have more important roles in oogenesis than in spermatogenesis."
17092636,Differential and spermatogenic cell-specific expression of DMRT1 during sex reversal in protogynous hermaphroditic groupers.,"Xia W, Zhou L, Yao B, Li CJ, Gui JF",Mol Cell Endocrinol. 2007 Jan 15;263(1-2):156-72. doi: 10.1016/j.mce.2006.09.014. Epub 2006 Nov 7.,"DMRT1 has been suggested to play different roles in sex determination and gonad differentiation, because different expression patterns have been reported among different vertebrates. The groupers, since their gonads first develop as ovary and then reverse into testis, have been thought as good models to study sex differentiation and determination. In this study, we cloned the full-length cDNAs of DMRT1 gene from orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides), and prepared corresponding anti-EcDMRT1 antiserum to study the relationship of DMRT1 to sex reversal. One important finding is that the grouper DMRT1 is not only differentially expressed in different stage gonads, but also restricted to specific stages and specific cells of spermatogenesis. Grouper DMRT1 protein exists only in spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes and secondary spermatocytes, but not in the supporting Sertoli cells. Moreover, we confirmed that EcSox3 is expressed not only in oogonia and different stage oocytes, but also in Sertoli cells and spermatogonia, and EcSox9 is expressed only in Sertoli cells. The data suggested that grouper DMRT1 might be a more specific sex differentiation gene for spermatogenesis, and play its role at the specific stages from spermatogonia to spermatocytes. In addition, no introns were found in the grouper DMRT1, and no duplicated DMRT1 genes were detected. The finding implicates that the intronless DMRT1 that is able to undergo rapid transcriptional turnover might be a significant gene for stimulating spermatogenesis in the protogynous hermaphroditic gonad."
16459120,Identification of a novel C2 domain factor in ovaries of orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides).,"Ji GD, Zhou L, Wang Y, Xia W, Gui JF",Comp Biochem Physiol B Biochem Mol Biol. 2006 Mar;143(3):374-83. doi: 10.1016/j.cbpb.2005.12.012. Epub 2006 Feb 3.,"Follicle consists of an oocyte and a lot of surrounding follicular cells, and significant interactions exist between the oocyte and the somatic cells. In this study, a novel cDNA has been screened from a subtractive cDNA library between tail bud embryos and blastula embryos in the protogynous hermaphrodite orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides). Its full-length cDNA is 821 bp, and has an ORF of 414 bp for encoding a peptide of 137 aa, which shows 38%, 37%, 33%, and 33% homology with 4 putative proteins screened from zebrafish (Danio rerio). Conserved domain search in NCBI reveals a single C2 domain existing in the C2 domain superfamily proteins, and has only 7 beta strands in comparison with 8 beta strands of C2 domains in other C2 domain superfamily proteins. Artificial sex reversal, RT-PCR analysis and Western blot detection demonstrated ovary-specific expression of the C2 domain factor, and therefore the novel gene was designated as E. coioides ovary-specific C2 domain factor, EcOC2 factor. Moreover, predominant expression of EcOC2 factor was further revealed in grouper mature ovary, and its strong immunofluorescence signals were located between granulosa cells and oocyte zona radiata in grouper mature follicles. The data indicate that the novel EcOC2 factor might be a main component that associates between granulosa cells and the oocyte during oocyte maturation, and might play significant roles in regulating oocyte maturation and ovulation. Further studies on its developmental behaviour and physiological functions will elucidate the interactions between oocyte and the surrounding somatic cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms."
15497048,Stimulatory effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and dopamine on growth hormone release and growth hormone mRNA expression in Epinephelus coioides.,"Ran XQ, Li WS, Lin HR",Sheng Li Xue Bao. 2004 Oct 25;56(5):644-50.,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and dopamine (DA) can stimulate growth hormone (GH) release, but their effects on GH mRNA synthesis are controversial and deficient in fish. Orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) is a hermaphroditic marine fish with sex reversal. Few data are available concerning the regulation of GH in grouper. In the present study, the effects of GnRH and DA on GH release and GH mRNA expression were determined using pituitary fragments of orange-spotted grouper under static culture conditions. After incubation from 1 h to 24 h, salmon GnRH (sGnRH, 100 nmol/L) stimulated the release of GH and increased the level of GH mRNA time-dependently. The minimum duration of sGnRH effect was 1 h. Both of sGnRH and mammalian GnRH (mGnRH) augmented the release of GH and the level of GH mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. The potency of sGnRH on both GH release and GH mRNA level was more pronounced than that of mGnRH. The effects of 1 micromol/L APO (Apomorphine), an agonist of D(1)/ D(2) dopamine receptors, significantly stimulated GH release and GH mRNA synthesis after incubation for 12 h. APO stimulated GH release and GH mRNA abundance in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that both GnRH and DA directly stimulate GH release and GH mRNA expression at the pituitary level, the actions of GnRH are more potent than that of DA in orange-spotted grouper."
15196702,Differential expression of thyroid-stimulating hormone beta subunit in gonads during sex reversal of orange-spotted and red-spotted groupers.,"Wang Y, Zhou L, Yao B, Li CJ, Gui JF",Mol Cell Endocrinol. 2004 May 31;220(1-2):77-88. doi: 10.1016/j.mce.2004.03.007.,"We have cloned and characterized the full-length cDNA encoding thyroid-stimulating hormone beta-subunit (TSHbeta) from orange-spotted grouper Epinephelus coioides. It contains 913 nucleotides with an open reading frame encoding 146 amino acids with a 20 amino acid signal peptide. The grouper mature TSHbeta has 75, 70, 61, 59, 41, 42 and 40% identities to that of rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon, zebrafish, European eel, chicken, mouse and human, respectively. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the TSHbeta mRNA was expressed abundantly not only in pituitary but also in gonads. A more interesting finding is to reveal the differential TSHbeta expressions between the ovaries and the transitional gonads or testes in natural individuals of orange-spotted grouper and red-spotted grouper Epinephelus akaara, and in artificial sex reversal individuals of red-spotted grouper induced by MT feeding. In situ hybridization localization provided direct evidence that the TSHbeta was transcribed in the germ cells. In the growing oocytes, the TSHbeta transcripts were concentrated on the ooplasm periphery. In testicular tissues, the intensively expressed TSHbeta cells were found to be spermatogonia and spermatocytes in the spermatogenic cysts. This is the first report of a TSHbeta expressed in the gonads of any vertebrates in addition to the expected expression in the pituitary, and it expresses more transcripts in the gonads during sex reversal or testis than in the ovaries both in E. coioides and E. akaara. Importantly, the TSHbeta identification in germ cells allows us to further investigate the functional roles and the molecular mechanisms in gametogenesis of groupers, especially in sex reversal and in spermatogenesis."
