In the present study, a genome-wide analysis identified the numbers of β-hsd genes in orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) (19), human (Homo sapiens) (22), mouse (Mus musculus) (24), chicken (Gallus gallus) (16), xenopus (Xenopus tropicalis) (24), coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) (17), spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) (14), zebrafish (Danio rerio) (19), fugu (Takifugu rubripes) (19), tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) (19), medaka (Oryzias latipes) (19), stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) (17) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) (27) samples. A comparative analysis revealed that the number of β-hsd genes in teleost fish was no greater than in tetrapods due to gene loss followed by a teleost-specific whole-genome duplication event. Based on transcriptome data from grouper brain and gonad samples during sex reversal, six β-hsd genes had relatively high expression levels in the brain, indicating that these genes may be required for neurogenesis or the maintenance of specific biological processes in the brain. In the gonad, two and eight β-hsd genes were up- and downregulated, respectively, indicating their important roles in sex reversal. Our results demonstrated that β-hsd genes may be involved in the sex reversal of grouper by regulating the synthesis and metabolism of sex steroid hormones.In almost all vertebrates, sexual reproduction requires both females and males to maintain survival and variation. Therefore, sex determination and differentiation are important processes for the continuation of species (Kobayashi et al., 2013). The orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) is a protogynous hermaphrodite species. The gonads of most groupers develop into ovaries during the first sex differentiation; however, the ovaries of some individuals then change to testis after female sexual maturation is complete in a process known as sex reversal (Liu and de Mitcheson, 2009). Gonadal changes in sex-changing fish are accompanied by changes in plasma levels of sex steroids (Godwin, 2010), and the balance between estrogen and androgen controls the direction of gonadal development during sex reversal (Liu et al., 2017).All classes of steroid hormones are synthesized from the common precursor cholesterol. The synthesis of sex steroid hormones is carried out under the catalysis of a series of enzymes, and the genes encoding these enzymes include hsd3b1, hsd11b2, hsd17b1, hsd17b3, and hsd20b2 of the beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (β-HSDs) superfamily, and cyp11a1, cyp11b, cyp17a1, cyp19a1a, and cyp21a1 of the cytochrome P450 (cP450) superfamily (Tokarz et al., 2015). Hsd3b1 is responsible for the oxidation and isomerization of Δ5-3β-hydroxysteroid precursors in order to form Δ4-3-ketosteroid (Nakamoto et al., 2012). Hsd11b2 catalyzes the conversion of cortisol to cortisone (Fuller et al., 2012), and also plays a crucial role in the conversion of 11β-OH-androstenedione to 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) (Tokarz et al., 2015), which affects the production of the most important androgen in teleost fish. Furthermore Hsd17b1 converts inactive estrone to active estradiol (Mindnich et al., 2004), Hsd17b3 is an essential enzyme for the synthesis of 11-KT (Mindnich et al., 2005) and Hsd20b2 converts 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone to 17alpha,20beta-DP, which has been identified as the maturation-inducing hormone of several teleosts (Senthilkumaran et al., 2002).HSDs catalyze the conversion of a hydroxy group to a keto group or vice versa on a steroid ring in a specific position and orientation (Yang et al., 2005). Different types of β-HSDs are found in various tissues including brain and gonad (He et al., 2018), and most belong to the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, except for HSD17B5, which belongs to the structural family of aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) (Day et al., 2008). To the best of our knowledge, systematic identification of the SDR and HSD gene families has only been performed in plants (Moummou et al., 2012) and bacteria (Kisiela et al., 2012), respectively. In addition, functional studies of β-hsd genes have mainly utilized human, mouse and zebrafish model organisms, while little is known about their expression and function in other species.Orange-spotted grouper is an important marine fish cultured in China and Southeast Asian countries. Recently, sequencing and assembly of the grouper genome, and RNA-sequencing of the brain and gonad of grouper during sex reversal were completed (unpublished data), making it a good model for genome-wide identification and gonadal expression profiling of β-hsd genes.Here we report the genome-wide identification of β-hsd genes in grouper, human (Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus), chicken (Gallus gallus), xenopus (Xenopus tropicalis), coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae), spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus), zebrafish (Danio rerio), fugu (Takifugu rubripes), tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), medaka (Oryzias latipes), stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Furthermore, RNA-seq data was used to analyze the expression of β-hsd genes during the sex reversal of grouper. Our study may provide a greater understanding of the evolution and possible functions of β-hsd genes in teleosts.All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines and approval of the Animal Research and Ethics Committees of Sun Yat-sen University. Grouper were cultivated in the Marine Fisheries Development Center of Guangdong Province. In April 2015, 100 groupers weighing approximately 5 kg were sacrificed for tissue sampling after being anesthetized by MS222. For each fish, the gonad and brain were taken and stored at −80°C for RNA extraction, and a piece of gonadal tissue was fixed in Bouin’s fluid for histological examination.Histological examination was performed as described previously (Xiao et al., 2018). Each gonad was assigned to one of five periods based on the gonadal morphology previously reported (Liu and de Mitcheson, 2009): ovarian-phase-2 (Ov2), ovarian-phase-3 (Ov3), ovarian-phase-4 (Ov4), bisexual-phase (Bi) and testis (Te). Ov2 gonad was predominated by primary-growth stage oocytes, Ov3 gonad was accompanied by the development of cortical-alveolus stage oocytes, and the appearance of vitellogenic stage oocytes indicated that the ovary had matured and belonged to Ov4. During the sex reversal of grouper, spermatogenic cysts and primary-growth stage oocytes are present in the bisexual-phase gonad simultaneously. The oocyte completely disappears and the gonad is filled with male germ cells, indicating that the sex reversal has been completed and the gonad has changed to testis.The genome sequences and predicted protein sequences of human1, mouse2, chicken3, xenopus4, coelacanth5, spotted gar6, zebrafish7, fugu8, tilapia9, medaka10, and stickleback11 were downloaded from Ensembl, and the sequences of the common carp were downloaded from NCBI12. The genomic sequence of grouper has been recently sequenced, with 1.03 GB of genomic data assembled and 23043 encoded genes predicted, of which 23,013 genes could be annotated (PRJEB28248 in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive site).To identify candidate β-hsd genes in these thirteen species, we collected the gene and protein names of the β-hsd gene family from the literature (Payne et al., 1997; Dai et al., 2003; Mindnich et al., 2004; Seckl, 2004; Hoffmann and Maser, 2007; Meier et al., 2009; Mindnich and Adamski, 2009; Sreenivasulu and Senthilkumaran, 2009; Rotinen et al., 2010; Kisiela et al., 2012; Saloniemi et al., 2012; Tokarz et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2013; He et al., 2018). Secondly, the amino acid sequences of human and zebrafish β-hsd genes were collected from Ensembl and GenBank by searching for their gene and protein names. Next, specific hidden Markov models (HMMs) of human and zebrafish β-HSDs were developed by hmmbuild command in HMMER (HMMER3.1B213) and then used as the query sequences to search the protein databases of all the studied species with hmmsearch command in HMMER (E-value = 0.01). Because all the β-hsd genes belong to the SDR family, except for hsd17b5, which belongs to the AKR superfamily, there was concern that the HMMs-based search would miss hsd17b5. Therefore, the amino acid sequence of human HSD17B5 was used as query sequence to search the protein databases of other species by local BLASTP with a cut off E-value of 1e-5 (BLAST 2.2.26 release from NCBI by anonymous FTP14) (Altschul et al., 1997). All the suspected sequences were aligned with the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence database by online BLASTP program to obtain reliable sequences of β-hsd genes.To explore the structural diversity of the β-HSD family, the 19 grouper β-HSD protein sequences were submitted to the online CD-Search in CDD program15 (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2017) to search for functional domains (E-value = 0.01). In addition, the online tool GSDS 2.016 (Hu et al., 2015) was used to display the gene structure and functional domains of grouper β-hsd genes.Multiple alignment of the amino acid sequences of all β-HSDs from six species including grouper, human, mouse, zebrafish, tilapia, and stickleback was performed using ClustalX-2.1 program (Jeanmougin et al., 1998). The maximum likelihood tree and neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees were constructed using the MEGA7 program (Kumar et al., 2016).Brain and gonad tissue from two fish in each stage were selected for transcriptome sequencing. RNA extraction and detection, library construction, sequencing, gene expression calculation and differential gene expression analyses were performed as previously described (Xiao et al., 2018). These RNA-seq data (PRJNA564153 in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive site) were used to analyze the β-hsd gene expression profiles during sex reversal. The expression of β-hsd genes was shown using R packages (i386 3.4.0). The RPKM values were transformed into Z scores before drawing heatmap. Z scores were plotted according to Z = (x - μ)/σ, where x is the log2 transformed gene expression measurement and μ and σ are the mean and standard deviations of expression of the gene.To examine the reliability of RNA-seq results, 10 β-hsd genes were selected for validation using qRT-PCR. Because there were only four bisexual-phase fish among the 100 sacrificed individuals, four fish were used for qRT-PCR in each period. Total RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed using TRIzolTM reagent (Invitrogen, United States) and a Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche, United States), respectively. Specific primers (Supplementary Table S3) were designed by Primer Premier 6 software. β-actin was chosen to be the housekeeping gene for its stable expression in brain and gonad tissue during sex reversal. The qRT-PCR reactions based on SYBR (LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master, Roche, United States) were performed with a LightCycler 480 system (Roche, United States). Relative expression levels were calculated using the 2–△ △ Ct method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). Analysis and visualization of quantitative results was performed by GraphPad Prism 6.0, and one-way ANOVA statistical analysis was used in the analysis.A total of 22 and 19 β-hsd genes were collected from the human and zebrafish genome, respectively, which were used to construct HMM models. A set of 19 putative members of the β-hsd genes have been identified from the orange-spotted grouper genome (Table 1). Among the 19 β-hsd genes, a total of 14 were distributed across 10 linkage groups (LGs) in the grouper genome (Figure 1). In addition, we also identified 24, 16, 24, 17, 14, 19, 19, 19, 17, and 27 β-hsd genes in mouse, chicken, xenopus, coelacanth, spotted gar, fugu, tilapia, medaka, stickleback, and common carp, respectively (Table 1). The gene and protein IDs of the β-hsd genes of all species are listed in the attached table (Supplementary Table S1).Table 1. Number variation of β-hsd genes in the orange-spotted grouper and the other surveyed animals.Figure 1. Chromosome localization of 19 β-hsd genes from orange-spotted grouper.The exon-intron structure of the grouper β-hsd genes was further characterized, and showed that the number of introns in each β-hsd gene varied from 2–16 (Figure 2B). Hsd3b1 was the gene with the lowest number of introns, containing only two, while hsd17b4 had the greatest amount at 16. In addition, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the grouper β-HSD protein sequences to determine whether the exon-intron structure is consistent with the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2A). As expected, several genes with similar exon/intron structures were clustered together on the phylogenetic tree, such as hsd17b7/hsd17b7l, hsd20b2/hsd17b12a/hsd17b12b. However, due to large number of exon/intron structure types of the grouper β-hsd genes, only a few genes shared similar structures.Figure 2. Phylogenetic analysis, gene structure and conserved domains of β-hsd genes in orange-spotted grouper. (A) The phylogenetic tree of all β-Hsd in grouper was constructed using Neighbor-Joining method. (B) The exon/intron organization of β-hsd genes of grouper. The red boxes represent exons and black lines indicate introns. (C) The conserved protein domains in the β-Hsd were identified using CD-Search program. Each domain is indicated with a specific color. Yellow: NADB_Rossmann superfamily, green: PLN02864 superfamily, purple: SCP2 superfamily, blue: SDR superfamily.The functional domains of grouper β-HSD were predicted by the CD-Search (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2017) based on their protein sequences (Figure 2C). As shown in Figure 2C, 18 of the 19 grouper β-HSDs possessed an SDR superfamily domain, except Hsdl2, indicating a high level of conservation of β-hsd genes belonging to the SDR superfamily. In addition to the SDR superfamily domain, Hsd17b4 also contained two other domains: PLN02864 superfamily domain and SCP2 superfamily domain. Notably, Hsdl2 was a member of the SDR superfamily, but no SDR superfamily domain existed in grouper Hsdl2, according to the CDD prediction. Therefore, we also predicted the functional domain of Hsdl2 protein sequences of other species by CD-Search (Supplementary Figure S1). As shown in Supplementary Figure S1, six Hsdl2 protein sequences contained the SDR superfamily domain and did not contain the NADB_Rossmann superfamily domain, while the other eight Hsdl2 protein sequences, including grouper Hsdl2, were the opposite.To clarify the evolutionary relationships among β-hsd genes, a phylogenetic tree was constructed with amino acid sequences of 96 β-HSDs collected from grouper, human, zebrafish, stickleback, and tilapia. Both maximum likelihood (ML, Figure 3) and Neighboring-Joining method (NJ, Supplementary Figure S2) strategies were devoted to construct phylogenetic trees based on the alignment of their amino acid sequences. The trees produced by these two methods differed only in a small number of branches, indicating that the evolutionary tree is credible.Figure 3. Phylogenetic relationships of β-Hsd proteins from grouper and other five species. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA7 by Maximum Likelihood method with the amino acid sequences of β-Hsd from grouper (Epinephelus coioides, Ec), (Homo sapiens, Hs), mouse (Mus musculus, Mm), zebrafish (Danio rerio, Dr), tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus, On), and stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus, Ga).We used transcriptome data of grouper brains and gonads at five developmental stages, namely Ov2(ovarian-phase-2), Ov3(ovarian-phase-3), Ov4(ovarian-phase-4), Bi(bisexual-phase) and Te(testis), to profile the expression of β-hsd genes during sex reversal of grouper. By transcriptomic analysis, 18 of the 19 β-hsd genes were detected in the brains and gonads during sex reversal, except for hsd17b2 (Supplementary Table S2). According to the criteria that a gene is considered to be expressed if it exhibits an expression level with RPKM value ≥2, we found that except for hsd11b1l, hsd17b9, and hsd20b2, the other 15 β-hsd genes were expressed in the brains or gonads in at least one development stage (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table S2). Among these expressed β-hsd genes, eleven members (hsd3b1, hsd17b1, hsd17b4, hsd17b7l, hsd17b8, hsd17b10, hsdl17b12a, hsd17b12b, hsd17b14, hsdl1, and hsdl2) and six members (hsd11b2, hsd17b3, hsd17b10, hsd17b12b, hsdl1, and hsdl2) presented high expression (RPKM value ≥10) in gonads and brain in at least one developmental stage, respectively. As shown in Figure 4, the expression levels of eight β-hsd genes (hsd3b7, hsd17b1, hsd17b7l, hsd17b10, hsd17b12a, hsd17b12b, hsdl1, and hsdl2) were reduced, while two β-hsd genes (hsd3b1 and hsd17b14) were up-regulated in the gonad during sex reversal.Figure 4. Clustering of the expression profiles of 19 grouper β-hsd genes during sex reversal. Genes were clustered according to phylogenetic relationships in expression profiles. The RPKM values were transformed into Z scores. Z scores were plotted according to Z = (x - μ)/σ, where x is the log 2 transformed gene expression measurement and μ and σ are the mean and standard deviations of expression of the gene. Red and blue colors indicate high and low relative expression levels after homogenization, respectively. The RPKM value for each gene and each stage was provided in the figure.To further verify the expression levels of β-hsd genes during sex reversal of grouper, qRT-PCR validation experiments were conducted using gene-specific primers (Supplementary Table S3). The four genes involved in the synthesis of sex steroid hormones (hsd3b1, hsd11b2, hsd17b3, and hsd20b2) and eight genes with RPKM value ≥20 (a total of ten genes after de-duplication) were selected for qRT-PCR validation. Expression patterns during sex reversal of these 10 genes were shown to be consistent with transcriptome data (Figures 4, 5 and Supplementary Table S2).Figure 5. Quantitative RT-PCR examination of 10 β-hsd genes expressions in the brain and gonad during sex reversal of grouper. Values represent the relative mRNA expression in relation to internal control (β-actin gene). Data were expressed as the mean ± SEM for four replicates. In each panel, different lowercase letters indicate significant differences (p < 0.05).HSDs are a group of steroidogenic enzymes that are involved in steroid biosynthesis and metabolism (Ye et al., 2014). To the best of our knowledge, HSD gene repertoires have previously been described in bacteria (Kisiela et al., 2012), plants (Moummou et al., 2012), zebrafish (Mindnich et al., 2004; Mindnich and Adamski, 2009) and several mammals (Payne et al., 1997; Baker, 2001; Belyaeva and Kedishvili, 2006; Rotinen et al., 2010), but no studies have summarized all the β-hsd genes. Little is known about the corresponding grouper genes; however, the availability of the complete grouper genome sequence has made it possible to identify all the β-hsd genes in this species for the first time. In the present study, we systematically idntified 19 putative β-hsd genes in the E. coioides genome, and subsequently characterized the genes in terms of position in the genome, exon-intron structure and conserved domains. In addition, we also isolated β-hsd genes in samples of human, mouse, chicken, xenopus, coelacanth, spotted gar, zebrafish, fugu, tilapia, medaka, stickleback, and common carp. Finally, an analysis of grouper β-hsd gene expression levels during sex reversal indicated that these genes may play important roles in this significant physiological process. Our study represented the first comprehensive investigation of the fish β-hsd gene family, and the resulting data will undoubtedly be useful for future analyses, including further research into the role of β-hsd genes and sex steroids in sex reversal of grouper.Comparative analysis revealed several evolutionary phenomena of the β-hsd genes during the separation of fish species from other animals. First, unlike some other gene families which have undergone an expansion in the teleost fish, the number of β-hsd genes in teleost fish was no greater than in tetrapods. Studies have reported after two major radiations of jawed vertebrate, teleosts shared another round of whole-genome duplication events (the 3R WGD) (Kasahara et al., 2007), and common carp underwent an additional whole-genome duplication event (the 4R WGD) (Xu et al., 2014). For the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily, 48, 75, and 137 members have been reported in human, tilapia and common carp, respectively, suggesting that NRs may have expanded along with multiple duplication events (Cheng et al., 2015). The sox gene family has also undergone a continuous expansion in the teleost fish following their whole genome duplication (Wei et al., 2016). However, for the β-hsd genes, expansion after the 3R WGD and the 4R WGD was not as obvious as in the NR gene family and sox gene family. For example, hsd3b1 and hsd17b4 had only one copy in all species, and hsd17b3, hsdl1, and hsdl2 had two copies in common carp which had undergone the 4R WGD, and only one copy in other species. Such a phenomenon is considered to be a result of gene loss followed by the WGD. The duplication-degeneration-complementation (DDC) model proposed by Lynch and Conery (2000) on the fate of duplicated genes suggested that the common fate of a duplicated gene was lost from the genome owing to non-functionalization unless one of the duplicate genes acquired a new function, or the functions of the ancestral gene are sub-divided between the sister duplicate genes. Gene loss was thought to be a mechanism to maintain a balance for duplicated genes post genome duplication events. Gene loss is evident in the β-hsd gene family, but not so obvious in the NR and sox gene families, which may be due to different selective pressures or different evolutionary rates among different gene catalogs. Secondly, several genes were identified only in a particular species. For instance, among all the species we studied, Hsd3b3, Hsd3b4, Hsd3b5, and Hsd3b6 were specifically identified in the mouse genome. The six mouse Hsd3b genes (MnHsd3b1, MnHsd3b2 and four mouse-specific Hsd3b genes) were located in a small region (98499071-98859794) of chromosome 3 and clustered together in the phylogenetic tree, seemingly suggesting that the four mouse-specific Hsd3b genes were more likely a product of mouse-specific gene duplication rather than gene loss in other species. In addition, hsd20b2 was not identified in tetrapod genomes, apparently indicating that hsd20b2 may be lost in the tetrapod genome but retained in the teleost genome following their divergence.The orange-spotted grouper is a typical protogynous hermaphrodite species. Previous studies have shown that groupers in the natural environment generally develop into female individuals during the first sex differentiation (Liu and de Mitcheson, 2009). Then the sex reversal from female to male occur in a small part of mature/functional females, while the males retain the same sex throughout their life span (Bhandari et al., 2003). Sex steroids play a very important role in sex reversal of groupers. Low serum E2 levels and increased 11-KT levels are probably the events mediating protogynous sex change in grouper (Bhandari et al., 2003). In addition, exogenous androgens could artificially induce the sex reversal of groupers from female to male (Chen et al., 2011; Oh et al., 2013; Murata et al., 2014). However, little is known about the expression profiles of sex steroid synthesis and metabolism genes in the natural sex reversal process. HSDs participate in the synthesis and metabolism of sex steroid hormones by catalyzing the conversion of a hydroxy group to a keto group or vice versa on a steroid ring in a specific position and orientation (Yang et al., 2005). Studies on the expression profiles of hsd genes at different stages of grouper sex reversal may provide us a better understanding on the roles of hsd genes in sex reversal.The transcriptome data indicated that six (hsd11b2, hsd17b3, hsd17b10, hsd17b12b, hsdl1, and hsdl2) and eleven (hsd3b1, hsd17b1, hsd17b4, hsd17b7l, hsd17b8, hsd17b10, hsdl17b12a, hsd17b12b, hsd17b14, hsdl1, and hsdl2) β-HSD genes had relatively high expression levels (RPKM >10) in the brain and gonad during sex reversal of grouper, respectively. HSDs are indispensable neuro-steroidogenic enzymes, and the neuro-steroids synthesized in neurons and glia can act on various receptors to regulate neuroexcitability while also playing important roles in brain development, neuroprotection and neurogenesis as well as cognition and memory (He et al., 2018). For example, human HSD17B10 is found in various brain regions and is essential for the maintenance of neurosteroid homeostasis (He et al., 2018); and Hsd11b2 is involved in the negative feedback regulation of cortisol post stress in the brain of zebrafish (Alderman and Vijayan, 2012). In grouper, transcriptome data has shown that the expression levels of six β-hsd genes highly expressed in the brain did not change significantly during sexual reversal, seemingly indicating that these genes may be required for neurogenesis or the maintenance of specific biological processes in the brain, but not for sex reversal events.In the gonad, two (hsd3b1 and hsd17b14) and eight (hsd3b7, hsd17b1, hsd17b7l, hsd17b10, hsd17b12a, hsd17b12b, hsdl1, and hsdl2) β-HSD genes were up- and downregulated during sex reversal, respectively. Hsd3b1 catalyzes the second step of steroidogenesis and is required for the synthesis of all steroids including 11-KT (Hsu et al., 2009). In human testis specimens, HSD17B14 protein has shown immunoreactivity in most of the seminiferous epithelium as well as in peritubular areas harboring Leydig cells (Sivik et al., 2012). Transfection of HSD17B14 in human breast cancer cells significantly decreased the levels of estradiol (Jansson et al., 2006), and further studies have suggested a role for HSD17B14 in the local inactivation of steroid (Lukacik et al., 2007). Therefore, we hypothesized that the increased expression levels of hsd3b1 during the sex reversal of grouper may promote the synthesis of 11-KT, while the increased expression level of hsd17b14 may lead to the inactivation of estradiol in this study.HSD17B1 is mainly expressed in the ovary (Mindnich and Adamski, 2009), and catalyzes lower estrogenic active estrone (E1) to highly active estradiol (E2) (Hakkarainen et al., 2015; Jarvensivu et al., 2015). HSD17B12 has been implicated in the conversion of estrone to estradiol as well as in the synthesis of arachidonic acid (AA), and plays important roles in ovarian function and female fertility (Kemilainen et al., 2016). Accordingly, we propose that the high expression levels of hsd17b1, hsd17b12a and hsd17b 12b in the ovary may be due to its involvement in the maintenance of the ovary, and the degeneration of ovary leads to the downregulation of these genes during the sex reversal grouper. The 3-beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-C(27)-steroid oxidoreductase, which is encoded by HSD3B7 gene, is a membrane-bound enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum that catalyzes an early step in the synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol, and mutation of the HSD3B7 gene causes neonatal cholestasis (Cheng et al., 2003). Hsd17b7l was identified only in grouper, fugu, tilapia and medaka in this study, and its function has not been studied yet. HSD17B10 catalyzes the oxidation of neuroactive steroids and degradation of isoleucine in the nervous system (Yang et al., 2014). HSDL1 and HSDL2 is highly expressed in human testis and ovary tissue (Huang et al., 2001; Dai et al., 2003). However, the function of Hsd3b7, Hsd17b7l, Hsd17b10, Hsdl1, and Hsdl2 in the gonad is not well understood. Therefore, further studies are required to reveal their functions in the gonad and their roles in the sex reversal of grouper.Theβ-hsd genes play important roles in the biosynthesis and metabolism of steroids. In the present study, a genome-wide analysis identified numbers of the β-hsd genes in the human (22), mouse (24), chicken (16), xenopus (24), coelacanth (17), spotted gar (14), zebrafish (19), fugu (19), tilapia (19), medaka (19), stickleback (17), grouper (19), and common carp (27) samples. A comparative analysis revealed that the number of β-hsd genes in teleost fish was no greater than in tetrapods due to gene loss followed by the teleost-specific whole-genome duplication event. Transcriptome-based expression profiling uncovered the expressions of the β-hsd genes during the sex reversal of grouper.

In the present study, vasa (Ecvasa) and dazl (Ecdazl) cDNA were cloned from orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides). The full-length cDNA sequences of Ecvasa and Ecdazl were 2162 and 2101 bp, and encoded 646 and 214 amino acid residues, respectively. Reversal transcription PCR showed that Ecvasa and Ecdazl mRNA were highly expressed in the gonads. Further, in situ hybridization revealed that Ecvasa and Ecdazl RNA were dynamically expressed in germ cells at different stages during oogenesis, sex reversal, and spermatogenesis in orange-spotted grouper. Intriguingly, the signals for Ecvasa and Ecdazl mRNA became weaker in oocytes of ovo-testes gonads, indicating that the expression of germ cell genes could be suppressed in oocytes during sex reversal in the orange-spotted grouper. Our study is the first time to describe the expression profiles of vasa and dazl mRNA in germ cells during gametogenesis and sex reversal in the orange-spotted grouper. These findings will provide new insights into understanding the mechanisms through which vasa and dazl regulate germ cell differentiation in hermaphrodite fish species.Germ cell development is the basis of animal reproduction. The formation and development of germ cells, which originate from primordial germ cells and are specialized during embryogenesis, are extremely complex processes. Processes from the formation of primordial germ cells to their maturation are regulated by many factors including genes, hormones, and the environment (Barske and Capel, 2008). Germ cell markers could be effectively used to trace the development of germ cells, and this would facilitate studying the mechanisms behind the specification and development of germ cells. Moreover, there have been many studies on gene markers of germ cells and other gonadal cells including the PGC specific gene nanos3 (Sun et al., 2017), the germline stem cell gene nanos2 (Sun et al., 2017), the Sertoli cell gene sox9 (Xu et al., 2007), and the germ cell genes vasa, dazl, and boule (Xu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2011; Bhat and Hong, 2014).Vasa (Ddx4, DEAD box polypeptide 4) is a well-known germ cell marker gene. Vasa protein is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, highly conserved across phyla, which also presents a characteristic DEAD-box (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) (Mochizuki et al., 2001). The vasa gene was initially identified as a maternal-effect gene, and mutations in this gene were found to cause abdominal deformities and developmental failure in Drosophila germ cells (Schüpbach and Wieschaus, 1986). Subsequently, a vasa-like gene was also identified in fish (Kobayashi et al., 2000), amphibians (Marracci et al., 2007), birds (Tsunekawa et al., 2000), and mammals (Toyooka et al., 2000). In Hydra magnipapillata, vasa was found to be expressed both in oocytes and nurse cells (Mochizuki et al., 2001). In addition, in medaka (Shinomiya et al., 2000), mice (Toyooka et al., 2000), and most other species, the vasa gene is expressed only in the germ cell lineage from the embryo stage to the adult gonad.Dazl (deleted in azoospermia-like), a maternal gene, is another germ cell marker gene in vertebrates (Johnson et al., 2001; Li et al., 2011, 2016). The dazl gene belongs to the DAZ (deleted in azoospermia) family, which contains boule, daz, and dazl (Xu et al., 2001). These genes encode proteins with an RNA-binding domain. The dazl gene has been found in different species, including fish (Li et al., 2011), axolotl (Johnson et al., 2001), chickens (Lee et al., 2016), and humans (Reijo et al., 2000).Although vasa and dazl are widely defined as germ cell marker genes in many animals, their expression patterns vary and present species-specificity to a variable extent in different species. (Bhat and Hong, 2014; Cardinali et al., 2004; Dwarakanath et al., 2014; Li et al., 2017; Kobayashi et al., 2000; Úbeda-Manzanaro et al., 2014). In addition to their important roles in germ cell marker, Vasa and dazl can also play important roles in germ cell development, proliferation, and differentiation. The number of PGCs (primordial germ cells) was significantly reduced, and differentiation failure was induced when Xenopus laevis were microinjected with an anti-vasa antibody (Ikenishi and Tanaka, 1997). In medaka, vasa knockout resulted in a PGC migration defect but did not alter PGC numbers (Li et al., 2009), while zebrafish with vasa mutations developed exclusively into sterile males (Hartung et al., 2014). Interestingly, dazl might possess similar functions to vasa in germ cells. For example, the microinjection of a Dazl antibody significantly reduced the number of PGCs and even completely abolished PGC formation in medaka (Li et al., 2016). In both male and female mice, Dazl mutations resulted in the failure of germ cells to complete meiotic prophase (Saunders et al., 2003). In addition, dazl inhibited the development of PGCs by limiting the translation of core pluripotency factors, differentiation, and apoptosis, implying that dazl has an active role in large mRNA/protein interactive networks (Chen et al., 2014).In the grouper, a typical protogynous hermaphroditic fish, the gonad first develops as an ovary and then reverses into a testis during the course of the organism's life history, making it an ideal model for investigating ovarian development and sex reversal in fish (Chen et al., 2011). The regulatory mechanism of sex differentiation and sex reversal for these species are far from been clarified. The discovery of specific germ cell marker genes may be of great help in the study of this process. In the present study, we identified and cloned two germ cell genes, vasa and dazl, from orange spotted-grouper (Epinephelus coioides) and analyzed their expression patterns in gonads at different developmental stages during sexual reversal. These will ultimately provide the basis for further studies on the mechanisms underlying the differentiation and migration of PGCs, gonadal development, sex differentiation, and sex reversal in grouper.Orange-spotted grouper were obtained from the Marine Fisheries Development Center of Guangdong Province (Huizhou, Guangdong, China). Fish were reared under controlled water temperatures of 22.7–27.7 °C. The use of animals in this study was endorsed by the respective Animal Research and Ethics Committees of Sun Yat-Sen University, and all experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the committee.Total RNA from the orange-spotted grouper samples was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA). The RNA quality was assessed by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis and verified using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, 2000/2000c, USA) with the A260/A280 ratio between 1.8 and 2.0. Full-length cDNA sequences of Ecvasa and Ecdazl were cloned from the ovary using 5′ RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) and 3′ RACE by the SMARTer™ RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech, USA). Based on the cDNA fragments of the E. coioides genome (unpublished data), two pairs of vasa primers, vasa-5′ R1/vasa-5′ R2 and vasa-3′ F1/vasa-3′ F2 were designed (Supplementary Table 1). Two rounds of PCR were conducted for the 5′ and 3′ RACE amplification. The vasa-5′ R1 and UPM (universal primer) comprising long-UPM and short-UPM were mixed at a ratio of 1:5 for the first round 5′ RACE primers, whereas vasa-3′ F1 and UPM were used as the first round primers for 3′ RACE. vasa-5′ R2 and NUP (nested universal primer), as well as vasa-3′ F2 and NUP, were used as the second-round primers for 5′ and 3′ RACE, respectively. The same method was used to clone the full-length cDNA of dazl. PCR was performed using a KOD-Plus-Neo (Toyobo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All PCR products were separated on 1.2% agarose gels, purified using a Gel Extraction Kit (Omega), and then ligated into PGEM®-T (Promega, USA). Five different positive clones were selected for sequencing.Putative amino acid and multiple sequence alignments were performed using DNAMAN version 8 (USA). Phylogenetic trees were generated with MEGA version 4.0 (USA) using the neighbor-joining method.The tissue expression patterns of Ecvasa and Ecdazl mRNA in orange-spotted grouper were analyzed by reversal transcription PCR. The primers were presented in Supplementary Table 1. Ten tissues, including testis, ovary, pituitary, stomach, liver, gill, intestine, kidney, muscle and spleen, were collected from adult females and males. The fish was anesthetized with 0.05% MS222 before being euthanized. Tissues were quickly dissected, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80 °C for RNA extraction.The expression patterns of Ecvasa and Ecdazl during gonad development were analyzed using real-time PCR. Gonad samples were collected from orange-spotted grouper of three-month-old to three-year-old. The fish was anesthetized before being sacrificed. Gonad tissues were quickly dissected, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C for RNA extraction. Part of the gonad was conserved in 4% PFA (paraformaldehyde) for in situ hybridization. A piece from the central part of the gonad of each fish was fixed in Bouins’ solution for histology analysis. The development stages of the gonad of each fish was determined according to the histological criteria described in our previous study (Chen et al., 2011). Seven stages of gonads were collected in the present study, including gonadal stage-I: the ovary with proliferative oogonia and an ovarian lumen; gonadal stage-II: the ovary with mostly primary growth-stage oocytes; gonadal stage-III: the ovary with cortical alveolus-stage oocytes; gonadal stage-IV: the ovary with vitellogenic-stage oocytes; gonadal stage-V: the early bisexual gonad; gonadal stage-VI: the late bisexual gonad; gonadal stage-VII: the testis. Gonad tissue at each developmental stage was collected from five to eight fish.In situ hybridization was performed in accordance with a previously reported procedure (Xu et al., 2005). Briefly, gonadal tissues were dissected and fixed in 4% PFA at 4 °C overnight, washed with PBS (phosphate buffered saline) at room temperature, dehydrated with gradient methanol/PBS, and stored in 100% methanol at −20 °C overnight. Then, the tissues were rehydrated with gradient methanol/PBS, immersed in 30% (w/v) sucrose–PBS at 4 °C overnight, embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura, USA), cryosectioned at 6–10 μm for ovaries and 4–5 μm for testis using a Leica RM2135 Microtome (Leica, Germany), and pasted on polylysine-coated slides (Fishery, USA).Probes were prepared using the DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche). The lengths of the vasa and dazl probes were 1041 and 707 bp, respectively (primers shown in Supplementary Table 1). The probes were treated with DNaseI (Ambion, USA) for 15 min at 37 °C, then purified with lithium chloride and ethanol. Frozen testis and ovary sections were pre-hybridized for a minimum of 1 h, then hybridized with either the sense or antisense probes at 65 °C for 12–18 h. The fluorescence and chemical in situ hybridization signals were developed by staining with anti-Digoxigenin-POD (Roche, Germany) and anti-Digoxigenin-AP (Roche, Germany), then incubated in TSA™ PLUS Fluorescein (PerkinElmer, USA) and NBT/BCIP (Roche, Germany) as the chromogenic substrates, respectively.Real-time PCR was performed on an ABI 7900 real-time PCR System. Total RNA was digested with DNaseI (Ambion, USA) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using the ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Kit (Toyobo). The PCR reactions are performed using SYBR Green I (Toyobo, Japan) and the primers were presented in Supplementary Table 1. All experiments were performed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 120 s at 50 °C and 120 s at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C, with final steps for 15 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 60 °C. The β-actin gene was used as an internal control.Gonadal tissues were fixed in Bouins’ solution overnight, dehydrated with serial grades of ethanol, treated with xylene, then embedded in paraffin. The gonadal tissues were serially-sectioned at 5–8 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Chen et al., 2011). The classification of gonadal stages was performed by light microscopy (Nikon IQ50, Japan).All data are expressed as the mean values ± SEM. Statistical analysis was carried out by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or a Student's t-test, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, USA).The full-length cDNA sequences of vasa and dazl were cloned by 5′ and 3′ RACE. The Ecvasa complete cDNA sequence (GenBank accession no. MK655479) was 2162 bp in length and consisted of 1961 bp of ORFs (open reading frames), 92 bp of 5′-UTR (untranslated region), 129 bp of 3′-UTR, and encoded a 646-amino acid protein (Supplementary Fig. 1). The full-length Ecdazl sequence (GenBank accession no. MK655477) was 2101 bp, consisted of a 645 bp ORF encoding 214 amino acid residues, a 96 bp 5′-UTR and a 1359 bp 3′-UTR (Supplementary Fig. 2).Multiple sequence alignment revealed that EcVasa shared high identity with fish Vasa sequences, ranging from 72 to 95% (Supplementary Table 2). EcVasa protein contained eight conserved motifs as follows: motifI (AQTGSGKT), motifIa (PTRELI), motifIb (TPGR), motifII (DEAD), motifIII (SAT), motifIV (RGLD), motifV (RGLD), and motifQ (GYVKPTPVQ) (Fig. 1). The EcDazl shared 54–63% identity with fish Dazl sequences and 38–51% with other species (Supplementary Table 2). EcDazl protein also had highly conserved RNP1 and RNP2 motifs in the RNA recognition motif (Fig. 2).Fig. 1. Amino acid alignments of Ecvasa with the homologs from other vertebrates. The GenBank for Vasa proteins used for this study are as follows: Homo sapiens (BC047455.1), Mus musculus (AAI37602.1), Gallus gallus (NP_990039.2), Xenopus tropicalis (NP_001016823.1), Pelodiscus sinensis (KT934805.1), Danio rerio (NM_131057.1), Oryzias latipes (AB063484.1), Epinephelus fuscoguttatus (KU695222.1), Drosophila melanogaster (CAA31405.1), Haliotis asinina (ACT35657.1), Epinephelus coioides (MK655479).Fig. 2.

In addition, EcVasa was clustered together with the Vasa homologs of brown-marbled grouper, tilapia, and medaka. The Dazl proteins were clustered into two separate clades, fish and other vertebrates (Fig. 4). Moreover, EcDazl was clustered together with tilapia and medaka Dazl proteins.Fig. 3. Phylogenetic tree generated with the neighbor-joining method of EcVasa. All the sequences of Vasa homologs were downloaded from GenBank.Fig. 4. Phylogenetic tree generated with the neighbor-joining method of EcDazl. All the sequences of Dazl homologs were downloade from GenBank.The expression of Ecvasa and Ecdazl was detected in tissues, the results showed that Ecvasa was specifically expressed in ovary and testis tissues, and not detected in the other somatic tissues examined (Fig. 5). However, the Ecdazl was highly expressed in gonads, and was also slightly expressed in non-gonad tissues such as the liver and kidney.Fig. 5. Analysis of Ecvasa and Ecdazl expression patterns at the level of mRNA in tissues by reversal transcription PCR. The β-actin gene was used as an internal control.The mRNA levels of Ecvasa and Ecdazl in gonads at different development stages were detected (Fig. 6), and the corresponding histological details of gonads are shown in Supplementary Fig. 3. The Ecvasa mRNA was lowly expressed in ovary at gonadal stage-I, but significantly increased in ovary at gonadal stage-II and decreased in ovary at gonadal stage-IV. During sex reversal from ovary to testis, the expression of Ecvasa was significantly increased. The mRNA level of Ecdazl was very low in ovary at gonadal stage-I, significantly increased in ovary at gonadal stage-II. And the Ecdazl expression level was also significantly increased during sex reversal.Fig. 6. Analysis of Ecvasa and Ecdazl expression patterns at the level of mRNA in gonads at different development stages by real-time PCR. (I) gonadal stage-I, the ovary with proliferative oogonia and ovarian lumen; (II) gonadal stage-II, the ovary with mostly primary growth-stage oocytes; (III) gonadal stage-III, the ovary with cortical alveolus stage oocytes; (IV) gonadal stage-IV, the ovary with vitellogenic stage oocytes; (V) gonadal stage-V, the early bisexual gonad; (VI) gonadal stage-VI, the late bisexual gonad; (VII) gonadal stage-VII, the testis. The results were presented as the mean ± SEM (n = 5–8) and the values with different letters (a–f) were significant different in pairwise comparisons (P < 0.05).Ecvasa mRNA signals were restricted to germ cells and were not detected in the negative control (Fig. 7a). In the ovary, Ecvasa mRNA was predominantly detected in the oogonia (Og), primary oocytes (O1), and cortical–alveolus stage oocytes (O2) but was scarcely detected in vitellogenic-stage oocytes (O3) (Fig. 7, Fig. 8). Signals of Ecvasa mRNA in the oogonia were moderate and uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm (Figs. 7b and 8a1–a3), highest in the primary oocytes and cortical-alveolus stage oocytes (Fig. 7c and d, Fig. 8b1–b3), while Ecvasa mRNA exhibited non-uniform distribution in the cytoplasm that formed condensed patches (Fig. 7c and d), but were scarcely detected in vitellogenic-stage oocytes (Figs. 7d and 8b1–b3). Similar to Ecvasa, the expression pattern of Ecdazl was moderate in the oogonia (Figs. 7h and 8a4–a6), peaked in primary oocytes and cortical-alveolus stage oocytes (Fig. 7i and j, Fig. 8b4–b6), and was weakly detected in the vitellogenic-stage oocytes (Figs. 7j and 8b4–b6). Ecdazl signals could not be detected in the negative control (Fig. 7g) and somatic cells of the ovary (Fig. 7, Fig. 8).Fig. 7.

The green is the vasa and dazl mRNA signal and the red is PI. Scale bar, 20 μm.In the testis, Ecvasa expression was detected from the spermatogonium to spermatid stages (Fig. 7, Fig. 8). The mRNA level of Ecvasa was strong in spermatogonia, but weak in spermatocytes and spermatids. Moreover, part of the Ecvasa signal was concentrated in one or more dots in the cytoplasm of spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids, whereas the others were uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm. All Ecvasa signals in spermatids were concentrated in the patches (Fig. 8). Ecdazl signals in the testis were also observed throughout spermatogenesis, with being the highest in the spermatogonia, strong in spermatocytes, and moderate in spermatids (Fig. 7, Fig. 8).In the bisexual gonad, Ecvasa and Ecdazl mRNA signals became degraded in oocytes, and were even undetectable in some of the oocytes; however, Ecvasa and Ecdazl mRNA could be easily detected in spermatocytes (Fig. 7e, k).In this study, Ecvasa and Ecdazl cDNA were cloned. Sequence analyses showed that EcVasa contains eight conserved motifs, showing the highest homology with previously described Vasa proteins (Xu et al., 2005). EcDazl had an RNA recognition motif, closely resembling to those reported in DAZ family members in other species (Johnson et al., 2001). Phylogenetic analysis showed that both EcVasa and EcDazl were clustered with Vasa and Dazl homologs, respectively. These analyses also indicated that EcVasa appears to be a Vasa homolog and that EcDazl is a Dazl homolog in the orange-spotted grouper. In addition, Vasa or Dazl homologs of orange-spotted grouper, tilapia, and medaka clustered into a single clade, whereas those of zebrafish and rainbow trout formed another clade, indicating that these proteins in orange-spotted grouper are closer to those of tilapia and medaka than those of zebrafish and rainbow trout. The findings imply that the functions of these genes in grouper might be more similar to those of the tilapia and medaka homologs (Kobayashi et al., 2000; Li et al., 2009, 2016).In this study, we observed that Ecvasa was exclusively expressed in gonads and not in somatic tissues. Therefore, vasa is gonad-specific gene in the orange-spotted grouper, this is similar to the previously reported in other species (Tsunekawa et al., 2000; Johnson et al., 2001; Li et al., 2017). However, the studies in the European sea bass revealed that vasa mRNA was also expressed in some of somatic tissues other than gonads (Blázquez et al., 2011). Likewise, the Ecdazl mRNA was highly expressed in gonads, also slightly detected in somatic tissues such as the liver and kidney. In Atlantic Salmon, dazl-1 was also shown to be expressed in gonads and non-gonadal tissues (Kleppe et al., 2017). On the contrary, adult tissues in various fish species including Asian seabass (Dwarakanath et al., 2014), medaka (Xu et al., 2007), tilapia (Bhat and Hong, 2014) had shown that dazl was restricted to gonads. These results suggest that vasa and dazl might play a multifunctional role, not only in the gonads but also in some nongonadal tissues.The expression profile of both the Ecvasa and Ecdazl in the ovary exhibited sexually dimorphic which is similar to those reported in tilapia (Kobayashi et al., 2000; Bhat and Hong, 2014) and medaka (Shinomiya et al., 2000; Xu et al., 2007). Moreover, during ovary development, the expression levels of vasa and dazl mRNA showed dynamic patterns: vasa and dazl mRNA were detected low in the early stage of gonad, such as the stage-I (the ovary with proliferative oogonia and an ovarian lumen), increased in gonadal stage-II (the ovary with mostly primary growth-stage oocytes) and gonadal stage-III (the ovary with cortical alveolus stage-oocytes). In addition, the analysis of in situ hybridization showed that the mRNA levels of Ecvasa and Ecdazl were moderate in the oogonium, abundant in primary oocytes and cortical-alveolus stage-oocytes, but scarce in vitellogenic-stage oocytes. Similar expression patterns were also observed for vasa transcript in tilapia (Kobayashi et al., 2000), medaka (Shinomiya et al., 2000), and gibel carp (Xu et al., 2005), as well as dazl mRNA in medaka (Xu et al., 2007) and tilapia (Bhat and Hong, 2014). Together, these results suggest that vasa and dazl genes might play an important role in the developing oocytes during oogenesis. However, the expression level of vasa in the oocytes of gilthead bream (Cardinali et al., 2004) and dazl in the oocytes of the Asian seabass (Dwarakanath et al., 2014) was found to be increased as the oocytes developed to the mature gametes.Furtherly, the analysis of in situ hybridization showed that the Ecvasa and Ecdazl signals became decreased in male germ cells through spermatogonia till spermatid in the testes of the orange-spotted grouper, thus demonstrating the similar expression patterns to those of medaka (Shinomiya et al., 2000) and tilapia (Kobayashi et al., 2000). Moreover, the Ecdazl signal was highest in spermatogonia, strong in spermatocytes, and moderate in spermatids, resulting in a similar expression pattern to that documented in rainbow trout (Li et al., 2014). These data suggest that both the vasa and dazl genes play important roles in spermatogenesis. Additionally, Ecvasa and Ecdazl mRNA were restricted to germ cells in gonads, and thus, they could be used as marker genes to trace the germ cells development in the orange-spotted grouper. However, vasa mRNA signal in the Chinese soft-shell turtle (Li et al., 2017) and DAZL transcript in human (Reijo et al., 2000) were found to be weak in spermatogonia and strong in spermatids. The findings indicated that vasa and dazl might play species-specific roles involved in germ cells’ differentiation across phyla.Importantly, the vasa and dazl RNA exhibited obvious subcellular distributions in grouper germ cells: most of vasa and dazl mRNA signals were concentrated into particles in the perinuclear cytoplasm of germ cells. This kind of particles might to be the Balbiani body which has been widely studied in other fish species (Li et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2014; Riccia et al., 2018). To verify this issue, it needs more extensive investigations in the future.Less expression of DAZL and VASA could cause azoospermic in men (Guo et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2001). The Dazl mutation would affect the amount, motility, and morphology of sperm in mice (Hsu et al., 2010). Moreover, it was reported that the overexpression of VASA and/or DAZL could induce stem cells (human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells) to differentiate into primordial germ cells and promote meiotic in germ cells (Medrano et al., 2012). DAZL can promote the entry of germ cells into meiosis in human (Jung et al., 2017). The orange-spotted grouper can undergo sex reversal, from female to male. During sex reversal, Ecvasa and Ecdazl expression levels gradually increase and are higher in the testis than the ovary. Previous studies have also reported that the expression levels of vasa and dazl are higher in the testis (Úbeda-Manzanaro et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2018). These results indicate that the dazl and vasa may play conserved roles in vertebrates, which also imply that dazl and vasa could promote mitosis and meiosis during gametogenesis in the orange-spotted grouper, similar to the functions of these two genes in the mammals. Additionally, the products of dazl and vasa genes would regulate the germ cells' development and directly or indirectly modulate the sexual reversal in the orange-spotted grouper. Intriguingly, in the ovo-testis gonads, Ecvasa and Ecdazl mRNA signals were found to become dramatically decreased or even undetectable in oocytes, while strong in the spermatogonia and spermatocyte. This indicates that sex reversal in the orange-spotted grouper might begin with the degeneration of female germ cells owing to the inhibition of these germline genes’ expression, which maintains oocyte development. This was similar to our previous report that in the early phase of sex reversal gonads, the male and female germ cells coexist, and genes related to the female pathway are suppressed while genes related to the male pathway are activated (Wang et al., 2017).In addition, during the hormone-induced sex reversal of nile tilapia from female to male, the female-related genes (eg. cyp19a1a) were inhibited and male-related genes (eg. cyp11b2, dmrt1) were activated (Sun et al., 2014). In Monopterus albus, the mRNA level of foxl2, mir-430a, mir-430b and nr5a1b in gonads were decreased during the natural sex change process while cyp19b, foxl3 and vasa were increased (Gao et al., 2014, 2016). In this study, the mRNA level of Ecvasa and Ecdazl were up-regulated in the sex reversal, which was consistent with the previous researches. These results indicate that sex reversal is an extremely complex process, involving not only hormone regulation, but also gene. To verify this issue, it needs more extensive investigations in the future.In summary, the vasa and dazl cDNAs were cloned and characterized in a typical protogynous hermaphroditic fish, the orange-spotted grouper. Ecvasa and Ecdazl mRNA were highly expressed in the gonads and specifically expressed in the germ cells. Moreover, Ecvasa and Ecdazl mRNA exhibited dynamic expression patterns in germ cells at different stages during gonadal development. The findings of this study would provide the basis for further investigations on the factors regulating gonadal development and sex reversal in the orange-spotted grouper.There is no financial/personal interest or belief that could affect their objectivity.This work was supported by National Key Research and Development Program (2018YFD0900203), China Agriculture Research System (ARS-47), the Program of the China-ASEAN Maritime Cooperation Fund of the Chinese government (42000–41170002), Yang Fan Innovative & Entrepreneurial Research Team Project (No.201312H10), Natural Science Foundation of China (u1401213, 31802266), and Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest (201403011).

It is widely known that CYP19 gene expression, aromatase activity, and E2 production can influence gonadal differentiation and sex reversal in teleost fish, but the feedback mechanisms whereby E2 regulates cyp19a1a remain poorly understood, especially regarding the potential roles of endogenous small RNA molecules (miRNAs). Here, we identified miR-26a-5p as a regulatory factor of its predicted target gene (cyp19a1a). In vitro and in vivo studies showed that miR-26a-5p can decrease cyp19a1a expression. Furthermore, high doses of E2 act as a repressor of miR-26a-5p. This study proposes a regulatory feedback loop whereby E2 regulates cyp19a1a through miR-26a-5p, and suggests that this positive feedback is an important aspect of the control of E2 production.Download : Download high-res image (313KB)Download : Download full-size imageWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

In the present study, two slbp cDNAs (Ecslbp1 and Ecslbp2) were cloned from a protogynous hermaphroditic orange-spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides. Ecslbp1 cDNA contained a 678 base pair (bp) open reading frame (ORF), encoding a predicted polypeptide of 225 amino acids. Ecslbp2 cDNA contained a 1041 bp, encoding a predicted protein of 346 amino acids. The result of real-time PCR revealed that Ecslbp2 mRNA was exclusively detected in the ovary. Moreover, it was found to be restricted to oocytes according to in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis. Ecslbp2 was found to be hardly detected in gonia and significantly increase in the cytoplasm of primary-growth stage oocytes, but decreased during the process of vitellogenesis. Interestingly, Ecslbp2 expression centralized as a perinuclear speckle in early-primary-growth stage oocytes, which appeared to form into the Balbiani body (Bb) in late-primary-growth stage oocytes. These data indicated that Ecslbp2 might play an important role in the process of oocyte development, and could serve as an oocyte-specific molecular marker for the study of ovary development and sex reversal in groupers.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

In many cases, the occurrence of sex change is triggered by a change in the social context, such as the disappearance of the dominant individual. The orange‐spotted grouper Epinephelus coioides is a typical protogynous hermaphrodite fish that changes sex from female to male and remains male throughout its life span. In this study, male‐to‐female sex reversal in male Epinephelus coioides was successfully induced by social isolation. The body length and mass, gonadal change, serum sex steroid hormone levels and sex‐related gene expression patterns during the process of socially controlled male‐to‐female sex reversal in E. coioides were systematically examined. This report investigates the physiological mechanisms of the socially controlled male‐to‐female sex reversal process in a protogynous hermaphrodite grouper species. The results enable us to study the physiological control of sex change, not only from female to male, but also from male to female.Volume94, Issue3March 2019Pages 414-421© 2019 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles•

There are many examples of sex change species among marine fish, but the molecular basis for the sex change is still unknown. Gonadal expression patterns of the dmrts and foxls genes in E. coioides have pointed to sexual dimorphism in this species and it has been shown that mRNA levels of dmrts and foxls to vary significantly during reproduction cycles. The steroid 17α-methyltestosterone was used to induce sex reversal in these fish, during which dmrts and foxls levels changed significantly and subsequently reverted to normal when 17α-methyltestosterone was withdrawn. Interestingly, the expression of dmrt2b and dmrt3 was not affected by this steroid. We speculate that the role of foxl2 in reproduction may be conserved via regulation of early differentiation of the ovary by the hypothalamus–pituitary–gonad axis, and dmrt2 may have a significant role in premature ovarian differentiation and maintenance in E. coioides. dmrt1 and foxl3 played a role in the development of the testes and are believed to be potential male regulatory genes.These authors contributed equally to this work.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

In this study, orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) fry were treated with letrozole (an aromatase inhibitor, AI), 17α-methyltestosterone (MT), or MT and 17β-estradiol (E2) simultaneously, during the period of gonadal formation and sex differentiation. MT feeding at 50 days after hatching resulted in gonadal dysgenesis, which could be rescued by E2 supplementation. Different doses of AI treatment led to different phenotypes: undifferentiated gonads were maintained in the AI group fed a low dose (5 mg/kg diet), whereas female-to-male sex reversal was observed in the AI group fed a high dose (100 mg/kg diet). MT and MT + E2 treatment could induce female-to-male sex reversal during sex differentiation (90 days after hatching). The expression of female pathway genes was suppressed, while the expression of genes in the male pathway was up-regulated in the MT + E2 group. Consistent with the expression of sex-related genes, the serum 11- ketotestosterone level was also upregulated in MT and MT + E2 group. Finally, we examined the expression of male-specific mark (DMRT1) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen in MT and MT + E2 induced sex reversal, and the result indicated that male germ cells and somatic cells may origin from the gonium and proliferative somatic cells surrounding the efferent duct, respectively. Overall, our data suggested that estrogen acts as a natural inducer of female differentiation, and that the co-administration of estrogen and androgen during sex differentiation leads to a male sex fate in the protogynous orange-spotted grouper.To purchase short term access, please sign in to your Oxford Academic account above.Don't already have an Oxford Academic account?

MT-Feeding-Induced Impermanent Sex Reversal in the Orange-Spotted Grouper during Sex Differentiation. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2018, 19, 2828.Subscribe to receive issue release notifications and newsletters from MDPI journalsA variety of mechanisms are involved in sex determination in vertebrates. The orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides), a teleost fish, functions first as females and later as a male and is an ideal model to investigate the regulation of sexual fate. Here, we report female-to-male sex reversal in juvenile orange-spotted groupers caused by overexpressing anti-Müllerian hormone (Amh). Tissue distribution analyses showed that amh and amhrII primarily expressed in the gonad, and expression level in the testis was much higher than that in the ovary. In gonads, the expression of amh was located in the Sertoli cells around spermatogonia of the testis and in the zona pellucida of the mature ovary, and the expression of amhrII was located in the Sertoli cells of the testis and in the oocytes of the ovary. Decrease in female-related genes and serum 17β-estradiol level, increase in male-related genes and serum 11-ketotestosterone, ovarian regression, and spermatogonia proliferation were observed during plasmid feeding experiment. These results illustrate that amh overexpression plasmid feeding can induce a female-to-male transition in grouper.In teleost fish, sex determination is a plastic process that is usually governed by the interaction between genetic (genetic sex determination) and environmental (environmental sex determination) factors. A variety of environmental factors, such as hormones, temperature, pH, breeding density, light intensity, and hypoxia, may affect the sex determination pathway [1–3]. When the sex determination “switch” is initiated by the master sex-determining gene, a genetic network of sex determination and differentiation that is composed of conserved sex differentiation genes is activated. Its downstream sex-related genes regulate the expression of sex steroid hormones and thereby direct the development of functional gonads with the sex phenotype [4, 5].Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), also known as Müllerian growth substance, belongs to the TGF-β (transforming growth factor beta) superfamily and is involved in the development of male embryos. Like other TGF-β family members, AMH binds to the type II AMH receptor (AMHRII), which forms a heterodimer with the type I AMH receptor (AMHRI). Bound by AMH, AMHRII phosphorylates AMHRI with its serine/threonine kinase activity, and thereby the Smad signaling pathway is activated [6–10]. In mammals, AMH has been implicated in male sex differentiation, female follicular development, and steroidogenesis in both sexes [11–12]. Although the “anti-Müllerian duct” effects of AMH have been primarily emphasized in higher vertebrates, this protein is a phylogenetically conserved signaling molecule and has been identified in many teleost fish species that lack a Müllerian duct, such as Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) [13], Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) [14], zebrafish (Danio rerio) [15], medaka (Oryzias latipes) [6], and others [16]. A duplicated copy of amh on the Y sex chromosome (amhY) is the master sex determinant in Atherinopsidae (Odontesthes hatcheri) [17] and Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) [18]. In addition, mutations of amhrII in medaka (Oryzias latipes) and Japanese Pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes) were found to result in male to female sex reversal [19–21]. Therefore, amhY/amhrII play a critical role in the regulation of sex determination in fish.The orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) is a protogynous hermaphroditic fish that is economically valuable and widely cultured in southern Asia [22]. The orange-spotted grouper is confirmed as protogynous, most orange-spotted grouper first matured as females at the age of 4–5 years and then some of the grouper could be sex reversed from females to males [23–26]. The primary oocytes were observed in the gonad of 1–3 years old grouper [27]. It can be used as a model to study vertebrate sex differentiation and sex reversal.Our previous studies of grouper revealed that the expression of amh in sex-reversed males after sex reversal is much higher than that in females before the sex reversal, which highlights the importance of the amh gene in sex reversal (unpublished data); these results of our research are consistent with other teams’ results [28]. In the present study, we analyzed the distributions of amh and amhrII in different tissues and also located the distributions of amh and amhrII in different stages of gonad development in adult orange-spotted grouper. The expression patterns of Amh and amhrII in the gonad were determined with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively. Amh overexpression plasmid was packaged for feeding experiments to explore the potential role of amh in the sexual reproduction of grouper. Our results shed light on the molecular regulation mechanism of sex reversal in marine fish, deepen our understanding of sex reversal, and ultimately may provide guidance for innovations in grouper culture technology.The juvenile monofemale grouper is an advantageous model ani-mal used to investigate the regulation of sexual fate. For plasmid feeding experiments (the feeding experiment was 36 consecutive days, not just 1 day), female orangespotted groupers, whose sex was determined by a gonadal biopsy, with an age of 1.5 years, a body weight of 0.8–1.0 kg, and a body length of 34.5–40.5 cm were obtained from the Daya Bay Fisheries Development Center(Huizhou, China).Relative expression of amh and amhrII mRNA in various tissues and developmental stages in orange-spotted grouper. All data were sampled from normal feeding grouper. (A) Profiles of gonadal development in grouper. (B and C) Relative expression of amh and amhrII mRNA in different developmental stages in gonads from normal feeding grouper. (D and E) Relative expression of amh and amhrII mRNA in various tissues of adult females (VO stage) and adult males (T stage) grouper. PO stage: primary oocyte stage; VO stage: vitellogenic oocyte stage; MO stage: mature oocyte stage; IP stage: initial phase of the female-to-male sex change; TP stage: terminal phase of the female-to-male sex change; T stage: testis stage; undiff: undifferentiated gonad; diff: differentiation. Amh and amhrII mRNA levels were quantified with quantitative real-time PCR. β-actin was used as the internal control. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E.M from six fish samples. Statistical differences were estimated using Student tests or one-way ANOVAs followed by Tukey tests (SPSS Software); a probability level (***P < 0.01) or different letters denote statistically significant differences.The remaining experimental grouper samples obtained from the Daya Bay Fisheries Development Center (Huizhou City, Guangdong Province, China) were derived from different developmental stages (from ovarian development to mature testis) of normal feeding except plasmid feeding experiment. We also draw profiles of gonadal development in grouper (Figure 1A).All animal experiments were conducted in accor-dance with the guidelines and approval of the A nimal Research and Ethics Committee of Sun Yat-Sen University.To construct amh overexpression plasmid, the sequence of amh was cloned into pcDNA4.0 (+) vectors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The plasmids were then encapsulated by liposomes, which were formed by thin film hydration using DOTAP (Sigma) and cholesterol (Sigma). The preparation of liposomes was modified from our previous study [29]. Briefly, DOTAP and cholesterol were heated to 70°C followed by a 2-h water bath at 65°C and a 10-min ultrasonication at 25°C. The mixture was extruded through a 100 nm membrane filter before empty pcDNA4.0 (+) plasmid or pcDNA4.0 (+)-amh plasmid were encapsulated by a 30-min ultrasonication at 25°C. The concentration of the construct was 20 μg/μL.The fish were randomly divided into three groups—the control group (n = 30), the empty plasmid (empty pcDNA4.0 (+)) feeding group (n = 30), and the amh overexpression plasmid (pcDNA4.0 (+)-amh) feeding group (n = 30)—and were cultured in seawater tanks separately. The control group was fed a normal commercial diet, the empty plasmid feeding group was fed a diet containing an empty plasmid (1 mL/kg feed), and the amh plasmid feeding group was fed a diet mixed with amh overexpression plasmid (1 mL/kg feed). Six random individuals from each group were sacrificed at 9 days after treatment (dat), 18 dat, 27 dat, and 36 dat. Gonadal tissues and serum samples were collected.Total RNA was extracted from the organs of orange-spotted grouper using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The cDNA was produced from 500 ng total RNA using the ReverTra Ace α-first strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) and used as the template in the subsequent real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses. The specific primers used in this study are listed in Table 1. The transcription levels of the target genes (anti-mullerian hormone (amh), typeII anti-mullerian hormone receptor (amhrII), ForkheadboxL2 (foxl2), aromatase gonad form (Cyp19a1a), doublesex and mab-3-related transcription factor 1 (Dmrt1), sex determining region y-box 9 (sox9), 11β-hyddroxysteroid dehydrogenase taye2 (hsd11b2), and 11beta-hydroxylase (Cyp11b)) were measured using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix Kit (ABI, Vernon, CA) using an ABI Real-Time PCR Fast System (ABI). The quantitative real-time-PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 58°C for 20 s, 72°C for 20 s, and then 84°C for 10 s (fluorescent data collection). All mRNA quantification data were normalized to β-actin and expressed as fold differences in target gene expression relative to the control.Nucleotide sequences of the primers used in this Study.Gonads were dissected, fixed in Bouin solution for 24 h at room temperature, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. All tissue blocks were sectioned at 5 μm by slicing machine (Leica RM2235, Germany) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for gonadal histology analysis.Blood samples were collected from the caudal vein of fish from each group. Serum samples were collected after centrifugation and stored at – 20°C. Serum E2 and 11-KT levels were measured using EIA Assay kits (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI).A fragment of the orange-spotted grouper amh cDNA was amplified using specific primers (shown in Table 1) and was inserted into pET-32a (+) expression vectors. Expression of recombinant amh protein was induced in Escherichia coli (DE3). The purification of expressed proteins was performed using a His-tag purification kit (Novagene, Chula Vista, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The preparation of polyclonal rabbit anti-Amh antibody was performed following the protocol described by the previous study with minor modifications [30]. White rabbits were first injected with complete Freund adjuvant (Sigma) at the vola. One week later, 500 μg of purified protein emulsified in complete Freund adjuvant was injected into the swollen lymph node. After the first injection, two booster injections were given containing the same amount of antigen but using incomplete Freund adjuvant (Sigma) each week. The rabbits were bled 2 weeks after the last booster injection, and serum samples were stored at –80°C. The rabbit anti-Dmrt1 antibody was provided by Dr Qing Wang of our laboratory [27].Western blot analyses were carried out to evaluate the specificity of the rabbit anti-Amh antibody (1:2000 dilution; present study) where tissue extracts from the liver, kidney, brain, ovary, testis, and different developmental stages in gonads were detected. For plasmid feeding experiment, western blot analyses were performed using rabbit anti-Amh antibody (1:2000 dilution; present study), His-tag antibody (1:3000 dilution; RRID: AB_11232599; proteintech), and β-actin antibody (1:5000 dilution; RRID: AB_2289225; proteintech) to detect the expression of amh and accumulation of plasmid in the gonads and serum (Table 3).Immunohistochemical analyses were performed as described previously [31]. We were carried out using rabbit anti-Amh antibody (1:200 dilution; present study) to locate the expression of amh in gonads of different development stages or using rabbit anti-Dmrt1 antibody (1:200 dilution; our own antibody) [27] to detect the emerge of spermatogonia in gonads of plasmid feeding fish. Photographs of the samples were taken under a Nikon light microscope 170 (Japan).AmhrII did not generate antibodies and therefore was located by in situ hybridization. The fish used for in situ hybridization were an adult female and male grouper. The whole gonad was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS (pH 7.0), kept at 4°C overnight, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose–PBS buffer for 14 h at 4°C. The gonad was embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakure, Japan), and the gonad was cross-cut into slices with a thickness of 7 μm for the ovaries and 10 μm (in order to maintain normal form) for the testis with a frozen microtome (Leica, Germany). Sense and antisense probes (primers showed in Table 1) were synthesized with a DIG RNA Labeling Mix (Roche, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The slides were permeabilized three times with PBT (PBS solution containing 0.1% Tween-20) for 10 min and then treated with proteinase K in PBT (10 μg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature, refixed in 4% PFA, and hybridized with sense and antisense probes of orange-spotted grouper amhrII at 58°C overnight. Following hybridization, the slides were washed and blocked with 2% fresh normal sheep serum. Probes were detected with an alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-DIG antibody (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), and stained using the NBT/BCIP reagent (Roche). Photographs of the samples were taken under a Nikon light microscope 170 (Japan).All data are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (S.E.M), statistical differences were estimated using Student tests or one-way ANOVAs followed by Tukey tests (SPSS Software), a probability level (***P < 0.01) or different letters denote statistically significant differences.Profiles of gonadal development in grouper were shown in Figure 1A. Amh and amhrII expression in gonads at different developmental stages was also analyzed. The samples in different developmental stages in gonads come from normal feeding grouper. Amh and amhrII in the testis stage were significantly increased compared to other periods (Figure 1B and C).The samples of different organs come from the adult females (VO stage) and adult males (T stage) grouper. The tissue expression pattern of amh and amhrII mRNA was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR normalized to β-actin. Amh was primarily expressed in gonads and the expression in the testis was much higher than that in the ovary. Low amh expression could also be detected in the intestine, kidney, heart, brain, pituitary, and skin, while no expression could be detected in the liver, stomach, gills, muscle, and spleen. (Figure 1D). AmhrII showed the highest expression in the gonads, while the testis had a higher expression level than the ovaries. Low amhrII expression could also be detected in the heart, kidney, brain, pituitary, and skin. The amhrII expressions in the liver, intestine, stomach, gills, muscle, and spleen were undetectable. (Figure 1E).To investigate the cellular origin of germ cells, we examined Amh expression using immunohistochemistry (IHC). The samples in different developmental stages in gonads come from normal feeding grouper (from ovarian development to mature testis). IHC staining revealed that Amh signals were detected in the zona pellucida in the VO stage and MO stage, while slight or absent in the PO stage (Figure 2A–F). In contrast, strong Amh signals were found in the Sertoli cells around the spermatogonia in the IP, TP, and T stages (Figure 2G and L). The different developmental stages of IHC results can correspond to the profiles of gonadal development in grouper (Figure 1A). The specificity of the grouper anti-Amh antibody that we used was confirmed via western blot. The Amh signals were only detected in the gonads (high in testes and low in the ovary) and were not found in other tissues, such as the liver, kidney, and brain (Figure 2M). We also examine the expression pattern in different developmental stages via western blot and the results are consistent with the qPCR results (Figure 2N).The rabbit anti-Amh antibody immunohistochemical localization of different gonadal stages from normal feeding orange-spotted grouper. Immunohistochemical localization of different gonadal stages of grouper. The samples in different developmental stages in gonads come from normal feeding grouper (from ovarian development to mature testis). Six different stages were used to evaluate the gene expression pattern of femaleness (A, C, and E), transition phase (G and I), and maleness (K). (A) Primary oocyte stage. (C) Vitellogenic oocyte stage. (E) Mature oocyte stage. (G) Initial phase of the female-to-male sex change. (I) Terminal phase of the female-to-male sex change. (K) Testis stage. B, D, F, H, J, and L show high magnification of the boxed areas in A, C, E, G, I, and K. (M and N) The rabbit anti-Amh antibody was used to detect the Amh expression specificity in different organs and in different stages of gonadal development after normal feeding. PO: primary oocyte; VO: vitellogenic oocyte; ZP: zona pellucida; MO: mature oocyte; RO: regressed oocyte; SG: spermatogonia; SC: spermatocytes; ST: spermatid. Scale bars, 100 μm.In situ hybridization results showed that expression of amhrII in the ovary occurred mainly in the follicular cells (Figure 3B and C). AmhrII began to appear during the period of testis differentiation and was highly expressed in the Sertoli cell region around spermatogonia (Figure 3E and F). A negative control was provided (Figure 3A and D).AmhrII in situ hybridization in gonads of the orange-spotted grouper after normal feeding. Observation of the control group and the experimental group in the ovary (A, B and C) and testis (D, E, and F) sections under different magnifications. C and F show high magnification of the boxed areas in B and E. PO: primary oocyte; VO: vitellogenic oocyte; SC: spermatocytes; ST: spermatid. Scale bars, 100 μm.To explore the effect of the feeding experiment, we applied western blot to detect the expression of the His-tag and Amh in vivo; β-actin was used as an internal control. The His-tag could be detected in the gonad in all sample-taking day (9, 18, 27, and 36 dat) in both the empty plasmid feeding group and amh plasmid feeding group, but not in the control group, indicating that the delivery system using commercial food mixed with plasmid and liposomes solutions is effective to the grouper. Furthermore, we examined the Amh expression in the gonads in the three groups, and the results showed that the Amh has a significant increase in the amh plasmid feeding group in all sample-taking day but not in the other two groups. There results showed that Amh could overexpress in the amh plasmid feeding group in vivo, importantly in the gonad (Figure 4A and B). All in all, overexpressing Amh level could be detected in the gonad after amh plasmid feeding.Western blot analysis of the expression in orange-spotted grouper after plasmid feeding experiments. (A) The rabbit anti-Amh antibody was used to detect the expression of Amh in gonad after plasmid feeding experiments. (B) The His-tag antibody was used to detect the accumulation of plasmid in goand after plasmid feeding experiments. The abbreviation is the same as in Figure 1.The gonad status of each individual was tracked by histology during the feeding experiments. From 9 to 36 dat, the gonads exhibited normal ovary structures in the control group and the empty plasmid feeding group (Figure 5A–H). In contrast, the gonads had apparent structure change in the amh plasmid feeding group: at 9 dat, the gonads had normal ovary structures (Figure 5I). at 18 dat, one fish gonad showed slighted regression [28], but the others fish gonads were still normal (Figure 5J). at 27 dat, half of the gonads had regressed and meanwhile some gonia-like cells appeared (Figure 5K and L). At 36 dat, all the ovaries had emerged a large number of gonia-like cells; surprisingly two fish appeared spermatocytes obviously (Figure 5M and N). The statistical table of gonadal status at each sample-taking time after plasmid feeding experiment was shown in Table 2.Gonad histology after amh overexpression plasmid feeding.

Scale bars, 100 μm.Statistics of gonadal changes in experimental feeding.Information of all antibodies list.Dmrt1 is a male-specific gene in grouper [1], and Dmrt1 protein exists only in spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, and secondary spermatocytes in orange-spotted grouper [30]. To confirm our speculation that the gonia-like cells were spermatogonia, we examined Dmrt1 expression using IHC. Dmrt1 signals were not detected in the control group and empty plasmid feeding group (Figure 6B, D, F, and H), but a positive Dmrt1 signal was found in the amh plasmid feeding group (Figure 6K, L, O, and P). Furthermore, strong Dmrt1-positive signals were observed in the gonia-like cells in the 27 (Figure 6K and L) to 36 dat (Figure 6O and P). These results showed that those fish had a male tendency after feeding the amh plasmid, which supports our notion that overexpressed Amh could induce female-to-male sex reversal in orange-spotted grouper.Gonad histology and immunohistology analysis by rabbit anti-Dmrt1 antibody in orange-spotted grouper. Results of HE staining of the gonads sampled at different times (A, C, E, G, I, and M).

Scale bars, 100 μm.We next analyzed the gene expression profiles of key sex differentiation genes during the amh plasmid feeding experiment induced sex reversal. Amh expression significantly increased from 9 dat to 36 dat (Figure 7A), amhrII expression significantly increased from 27 dat to 36 dat (Figure 7B), and sox9, dmrt1, cyp11b, and hsd11b2 expression significantly increased from 18 dat to 36 dat (Figure 7C–F). However, cyp19a1a and foxl2 expression significantly decreased from 27 dat to 36 dat (Figure 7G and H). These results indicate that amh plasmid feeding stimulated male pathway gene expression (sox9, dmrt1, cyp11b, and hsd11b2) and suppressed female pathway gene expression (cyp19a1a, foxl2).Expression profiles of key sex differentiation-related genes in the gonads during the amh overexpression plasmid feeding experiment. (A–F) Gene expression of amh (A), amhrII (B), sox9 (C), dmrt1 (D), cyp11b (E), hsd11b2 (F), cyp19a1a (G), and foxl2 (H) during amh overexpression plasmid induced sex reversal. β-actin was used as the internal control. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E.M from six fish samples. Statistical differences were estimated using one-way ANOVAs followed by Tukey tests (SPSS Software), and different letters denote statistically significant differences.For many fishes, a balance between endogenous estrogens and androgens maintains their sexual identity. Steroidogenesis plays a critical role in fish sex determination and differentiation [27]. Estrogen plays an important role in maintaining ovarian development [27], and decreased E2 levels may lead to the degradation of female germ cells, and then further disrupted ovarian development. At the other hand, 11-KT plays a critical role in maintaining the testes. In amh plasmid feeding fish, serum E2 had a significant decrease in the 36 dat while serum 11-KT had a significant increase in the 36 dat comparing with the control fish and the empty plasmid feeding fish (Figure 8A and B). Wu et al. put forward the concept that sexual fate determination (secondary sex determination) is regulated by endogenous sex steroid levels [28]. So, the sex reversal may be driven by the decreased the estrogen levels and the increased androgen levels in amh plasmid feeding group consequently.Serum sex steroid hormone level during amh overexpression plasmid feeding induced sex reversal. (A) E2 level in the control group, empty plasmid feeding group, and amh overexpression plasmid feeding group. (B) 11-KT level in the control group, empty plasmid feeding group, and amh overexpression plasmid feeding group. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E.M from six fish samples. Statistical differences were estimated using one-way ANOVAs followed by Tukey tests (SPSS Software), and different letters denote statistically significant differences.In mammals, AMH plays an important role in primordial follicle recruitment and folliculogenesis [37, 38]. In contrast to mammals, in teleost fishes the amh role in ovary remains largely unknown on account of the expression of amh in different species of fish is different. In some fish species, the expression of amh is at higher levels in the male gonads compared with those of females during the process of gonadal sex differentiation like in Japanese flounder [14], medaka [6], and rainbow trout [39]. On the other hand, in zebrafish, both adult males and females have the expression of amh [15], but amh gene showed testis-specific expressions in eels [40]. Our study found a low expression of amh/Amh in the female, and the expression gradually increased in the transition phase of female-to-male sex change in grouper. We speculate that although the expression of amh in the ovary is much lower than that in the testis, amh also plays a role in regulating ovarian development, but the role of amh in ovary requires a more in-depth study.The amh gene that is involved in the sexual determination in fish is similar to those in vertebrates, which suggests a conservation of sexual determination pathways. P450 aromatase (cyp19a1a) is the most important steroidogenic enzyme for ovarian differentiation due to its essential role in the production of 17β-estradiol, which is believed to be the major sex hormone for inducing and maintaining ovarian development in fish [4]. The AMH protein is known to directly inhibit cyp19a1a expression in mammals, and an inverse association between amh and cyp19a1a expression is reported in numerous fishes, including Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) [32], pejerrey (Odontesthes bonariensis) [33], rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) [34], southern flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma) [35], and zebrafish (Danio rerio) [36]. Amh levels are inversely expressed with respect to cyp19a1a expression at certain stages of sex differentiation in some fish species [15,33,34,36,41]; an inverse association between amh and cyp19a1a expression was also found in our study, but it is not clear whether amh directly downregulates cyp19a1a expression. The previous study showed that in teleost fish, dmrt1 and its orthologs have been observed to be involved in male sex determination and spermatogenesis [30,42–44]. Dmrt1 has the ability to reprogram the fate of sexual cells in the ovary [45]. The role of the downstream regulatory gene dmrt1 in sex determination is evolutionarily conserved [46]. In our work, we found that amh overexpression in vivo promotes the dmrt1 expression. Based on this, we concluded that dmrt1 has the same potency in fish. Although a causal relationship cannot be established from our data, our results suggest that amh may play an important role in initiating protogynous sex change by suppressing gonadal aromatase expression and/or activating a male-specific expression pathway.Estrogens or androgens are widely used in aquaculture to manipulate gender (for example, if one sex is preferred for economic reasons), but as pollutants, they can be serious threats to natural populations. In our study, sex change began at 27 dat in the amh overexpression plasmid feeding group, and in methyltestosterone (MT) feeding group the sex change began at the 24 dat [27]. We concluded that amh is comparable to MT in inducing sex reversal. Therefore, it may be possible to use amh as a surrogate for MT. However, how many days are required to achieve complete sex change and whether withdrawal of amh supplementation leads to reverting back to ovaries still need to be determined.In summary, amh plays an important role in sex reversal in grouper. Subsequent studies of the Amh signaling pathways are needed to explore the potential role of amh/amhrII in sexual differentiation and sex reversal to further understand the sex differentiation and sex reversal of bony fish.Edited by Dr. Rajendra Kumar, PhD, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.Grant Support: This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31572596, 31672631, 31702324), China Agriculture Research System (CARS-47), Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation (2015A030313069, 2017A030313109, 2018B030311026), the Guangdong Provincial Science and Technology Program (2013B090400017, 2015A020208002, 2017B090904022), The Special Fund for Fisheries-Scientific Research of Guangdong Province (A201600A02), Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangzhou (201607020014, 201804020013), Yang Fan Innovative & Entrepreneurial Research Team Project (No. 201312H10), Special Fund of State Key Laboratory of Developmental Biology of Freshwater and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (17lgpy115).Google ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarYH and CP contributed equally to this work.Oxford University Press is a department of the University of Oxford. It furthers the University's objective of excellence in research, scholarship, and education by publishing worldwideThe sex identity of fish can be easily manipulated by exogenous hormones. Treatment with 17-methyltestosterone (MT) has been widely used to induce a male fate, but the molecular and cellular processes underlying sex changes induced by MT treatments and the withdrawal of MT are not well studied. In this study, we systematically investigated gonadal histology, gene expression profiles, sex steroid hormone levels, and cellular changes during sex changes induced by MT-feeding and MT-feeding withdrawal in the protogynous orange-spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides. Based on gonadal histology, we demonstrated that MT-feeding-induced sex reversal can be divided into early and late phases: in the early phase, male and female germ cells coexist, and MT-feeding withdrawal leads to a female fate; in the late phase, only male germ cells are observed, and MT-feeding withdrawal does not reverse the process, leading to a male fate. In both the early and late phases, cytochrome P450 family19 subfamily A member 1 (cyp19a1a) gene expression increased in response to MT-feeding withdrawal. Finally, by tracing doublesex- and Mab-3-related transcription factor 1 (dmrt1)-expressing cells, we found that gonia-like cells in the germinal epithelium might be the major germ cell sources for developing testes during sex reversal. Collectively, our findings provide insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying sex changes induced by exogenous hormones.In vertebrates, sex is determined by genetic or environmental factors or by interactions between these two factors [1–3]. Teleosts display a high degree of diversity in their patterns of sex determination, including species that are gonochoristic, protogynous hermaphrodites (female-to-male sex change), or protandrous hermaphrodites (male-to-female sex change), thus providing an excellent model to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying sex determination/differentiation and sexual plasticity [4]. Treatments with exogenous sex steroids can induce secondary sex reversal in some fish, regardless of their genetic sex, and a number of studies suggest that genetic males can be changed to phenotypic females by treating them with estrogens [5–8]. Even sexually mature females can be induced to become functional males by treating them with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) [9–12]. In addition, feeding or implanting some fish with androgens can induce females to become functional males [13–15]. Early studies in our lab and in other labs have also found that methyltestosterone (MT) treatments can induce sex reversal in groupers, but studies on androgen-induced sex reversal have focused on the genes related to the reproduction axis [16–21], and the details of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved have been less studied.In medaka (Oryzias latipes), AI treatment can induce the differentiation of germline stem cells (GSCs) into spermatogonia (SG) [10], and more recent studies showed that GSCs are critical for sexual fate decision in medaka [22, 23]. In Nile tilapia, oogonia or GSC-like cells in the germinal epithelium are the major source of SG during AI-induced female-to-male sex reversal [9]. These data suggest that bipotential GSCs in the ovaries of adult fish can differentiate into SG in gonochoristic fish during the process of induced female-to-male sex reversal. However, in some species that naturally change sex, the germ cells of both sexes can coexist within an individual. For example, ovarian tissue with a few developing cysts made up of male germ cells has been observed in saddleback wrasse [24]. In protandrous black porgies (Acanthopagrus schlegelii), small numbers of primary oocytes (POs) have been observed in testicular tissue before sex reversal occurs [25, 26].Different genes have been identified to be involved in the male or female sex determination/differentiation pathways. For example, the differentiation of testes is regulated by several genes including dmrt1, sox9, cyp11b, and dax1 [27–30], whereas cyp19a1a and foxl2 are considered to be essential for ovarian differentiation [31, 32]. The process of sex reversal is accompanied by the expression of genes involved in the male or female sex differentiation pathway [9, 33, 34]. The orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) is a protogynous hermaphroditic fish that is economically valuable and widely cultured in southern Asia [35]. Most orange-spotted grouper first matured as females at the age of 4–5 years and then some of the grouper could be sex reversed to males. The POs were observed in the gonad of 1–3-year-old grouper. In this study, we systematically analyzed the gonadal histology, serum steroid hormone levels, expression of sex differentiation genes, and cellar changes that occur during the process of MT-feeding-induced sex reversal. Our results provide insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying sex changes induced by exogenous hormones.1.5-year-old orange-spotted groupers (body mass, 0.8–1.2 kg; body length, 37.5–45.5 cm) were obtained from the Guangdong Daya Bay Fishery Development Center (Huizhou City, Guangdong, P.R. China) in May 2015, and the reproductive season of groupers was from April to October. The orange-spotted groupers were all female as determined based on the gonadal histology analysis of five fish. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines and approval of the respective Animal Research and Ethics Committees of the Sun Yat-Sen University.Fish were randomly divided into two groups: the control group and the MT-feeding group. The two groups were kept in separate seawater tanks. Fish in the MT-feeding group (n = 60) were fed food mixed with MT (10 mg/kg diet) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), whereas the control fish (n = 30) were fed food without MT. Five control fish and five MT-fed fish were sacrificed, and gonadal tissues and serum samples were collected at 12 days after treatment (dat), 24 dat, 36 dat, and 96 dat.To investigate the effects of MT-feeding withdrawal on the sex change process, we removed 15 fish from the MT-feeding group at 36 dat and 96 dat. Gonadal tissues and serum samples from the control, MT-feeding, and MT-feeding-withdrawal groups were collected 2 months after MT-feeding withdrawal. The time schedule for the sampling procedures is shown in Figures 1A and 4A.Gonad histology of the MT-induced sex reversal. (A) The time schedule of sampling. The time points of sampling are indicated by arrows. (B) Gonad histology. a–d) Gonad histology from the control group, (e–l) gonad histology from the MT-feeding fish, (i–l) high magnification of the boxed areas in e–h. PO: primary oocyte; APO: atretic primary oocyte; OC: ovarian cavity; PSC: proliferous somatic cell; SG: spermatogonia; SC: spermatocytes; ST: spermatids; ED: efferent duct; G: gonia. Scale bars, 50 μm.Gonads were dissected, fixed in Bouin solution for 24 h at room temperature, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. All tissue blocks were sectioned at 5 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for analysis. The size, sample number, and the gonadal status of the sampled fish can be found in the Supplementary Table S1.Blood samples were collected from the caudal vein of fish from each group. Serum samples were collected after centrifugation and stored at –20°C. Serum oestradiol-17β (E2) and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) levels were measured using Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) Assay kits (Cayman Chemical Co) as described in the previous study [9].Total RNA was extracted from each sample and reverse transcribed using a Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analyses were performed on a Roche LightCycler 480 real-time PCR system using SYBR Green I Master (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The real-time PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 55°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 60 s. The mRNA levels of foxl2, cyp19a1a, dmrt1, sox9, and cyp11b were analyzed. Standard curves were generated based on serial dilutions of plasmid constructs, and β-actin was used as an internal control. After amplification, fluorescence data were converted to threshold cycle (CT) values. The concentration of the template in the sample was determined by comparing the CT value to the standard curve. Primers used in this study are listed in Table 1.Nucleotide sequences of the primers used in this study.A cDNA fragment of grouper dmrt1 was cloned into pET-32a (+) vectors to express the Dmrt1 protein (residues 110–283) in Escherichia coli (DE3). The expressed proteins were purified with a His-tag purification kit (Novagene, USA). The immunization method using white rabbits has been described previously [36]. White rabbits were first injected with complete Freund adjuvant (Sigma) at the vola, and 1 week later, 500 μg of purified protein emulsified in complete Freund adjuvant was injected into the swollen lymph node. After the first injection, two booster injections were given containing the same amount of antigen but using incomplete Freund adjuvant (Sigma) each week. The rabbits were bled 2 weeks after the last booster injection, and serum samples were stored at –80°C.The specificity of the polyclonal antiserum was evaluated via western blot analysis. Briefly, tissue extracts from the liver, kidneys, brain, ovaries, and testes of groupers were prepared as previously described [36]. The tissue extracts were separated on a 12% Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The rabbit anti-Dmrt1 antibody was diluted at a ratio of 1:1000.Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses were performed as described previously [37]. Antibodies against Dmrt1 were diluted at a ratio of 1:100. Photographs of the samples were taken under a Nikon light microscope (Japan).Quantitative data are expressed as the mean ± Standard deviation (SD). Significant differences were analyzed using a two-way Analysis of variance (ANOVA) (GraphPad 5.0). A probability level less than 0.05 indicates significant difference.To induce sex reversal in groupers, we fed 1.5-year-old orange-spotted groupers a diet containing MT (10 mg/kg diet). The sampling procedure is illustrated in Figure 1A. Gonadal histology was analyzed from the control and MT-fed groups. The gonads in the control fish were typical ovaries, containing many POs (Figure 1B, a–d). At 12 dat, the gonads from the MT-fed group contained proliferating somatic cells, atretic primary oocytes (APOs), and gonia (Figure 1B, e and i). From 24 to 36 dat, a large number of SG, spermatocytes (SC), and spermatids (ST) and a small number of APOs appeared in the MT-fed group (Figure 1B, f, g, j, and k). At 96 dat, the oocytes in the MT-fed group had disappeared, and the gonads were full of SG, SC, ST, and efferent duct tissue (Figure 1B, h and l). These data indicate that MT-feeding can effectively induce a female-to-male sex change in grouper in a few weeks.We next analyzed the gene expression profiles of key sex differentiation genes during MT-feeding-induced sex reversal. The gene expression of dmrt1 and sox9 significantly increased from 12 to 96 dat (Figure 2A and C), and cyp11b expression significantly increased from 24 to 36 dat. (Figure 2B). However, the expression of cyp19a1a significantly decreased from 12 to 96 dat (Figure 2D), and the expression of foxl2 did not significantly change from 12 to 96 dat (Figure 2E). These results indicate that MT- feeding stimulates male pathway gene expression but suppresses female pathway gene (cyp19a1a) expression.Expression profiles of key sex differentiation-related genes in the gonads during MT-feeding-induced sex reversal. (A–E) Gene expression of dmrt1 (A), cyp11b (B), sox9 (C), cyp19a1 (D), and foxl2 (E) during MT-induced sex reversal. β-actin was used as the internal control. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD for three replicates obtained from five fish samples. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001 between the control group and MT-feeding group.Compared with levels in control fish, serum E2 levels significantly decreased from 12 to 96 dat in MT-fed fish (Figure 3A). In contrast, serum 11-KT levels significantly increased from 36 to 96 dat in the MT-fed fish (Figure 3B). These results indicate that MT-feeding decreases estrogen levels but increases androgen levels.Serum sex steroid hormone level during MT-induced sex reversal. (A) The E2 level in the control and MT-feeding group. (B) The 11-KT level in the control and MT-feeding group. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD for five fish. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01 between the control group and MT-feeding group.We next investigated whether the MT-feeding-induced sex reversal could be maintained after stopping the MT treatment. The experimental design is illustrated in Figure 4A. The fish were fed MT for 36 days or 96 days, and MT treatment was then terminated and gonad samples were collected 60 days after MT-feeding withdrawal (96-day sampling and 156-day sampling, respectively).Gonad histology after MT-feeding withdrawal. (A) The time schedule of sampling. (B) Gonadal histology of the untreated control group, MT-feeding group, and MT-feeding group at 60 days post MT-feeding withdrawal. The panel b, d, f, h, j, and l are high magnification of the boxed areas in the panel a, c, e, g, i, and k. PO: primary oocyte; OC: ovarian cavity; SG: spermatogonia; SC: spermatocytes; ST: spermatid; scale bars, 50 μm.At both the 96-day and 156-day sampling points, the gonads of control fish contained numerous POs, and the gonads of MT-fed fish contained SG, SC, and ST (Figure 4B, a–h). However, in the 36-day MT-feeding-withdrawal group, male germ cells were absent and their gonads reverted to ovaries with a lot of POs (Figure 4B, i and j). In the 96-day MT-feeding-withdrawal group, however, the gonads maintain male characteristics, with a large number of SG, SC, and ST (Figure 4B, k and l). These data suggest that short-term MT-feeding-induced sex reversal is not stable in groupers.The expression levels of key genes involved in sex differentiation were further analyzed after MT-feeding withdrawal. The expression of the male pathway genes (dmrt1, cyp11b, and sox9) was significantly lower than in fish for which MT-feeding was not withdrawn only in the 36-day MT-feeding-withdrawal group but not in the 96-day MT-feeding-withdrawal group (Figure 5A–C). In both the 36-day and 96-day MT-feeding-withdrawal groups, the expression of cyp19a1a was significantly increased (more than fivefold compared to that of the control group) (Figure 5D), indicating that cyp19a1a expression is sensitive to MT treatment.Expression profiles of key sex differentiation-related genes in the gonads after MT-feeding withdrawal. (A–E) Gene expression of the dmrt1 (A), cyp11b (B), sox9 (C), cyp19a1 (D), and foxl2 (E) at the 60th day after MT-feeding withdrawal. β-actin was used as the internal control. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD for three replicates obtained from five different fish. Different letters represent statistically significant differences (P < 0.05).Serum E2 and 11-KT levels were also examined. The MT-fed groups had low levels of E2 and high levels of 11-KT (Figure 6A and B). Compared with levels in the control group, E2 levels were significantly increased in the 36-day MT-feeding-withdrawal group but were significantly deceased in the 96-day MT-feeding-withdrawal group (Figure 6A), whereas 11-KT levels did not significantly change in the 36-day MT-feeding-withdrawal group but were significantly increased in the 96-day MT-feeding-withdrawal group (Figure 6B).Serum sex steroid hormone level after MT-feeding withdrawal.

Data are expressed as the mean ± SD for five fish. Different letters represent statistically significant differences (P < 0.05).To investigate the cellular origin of the male germ cells during MT-feeding-induced sex reversal, we examined Dmrt1 expression using IHC. The specificity of the grouper Dmrt1antibody that we used was confirmed via western blotting. The Dmrt1 protein was only detected in the testes and was not found in other tissues, such as the liver, kidneys, brain, and ovaries (Figure 7A). Dmrt1-positive signals were found in second SC in the testes but were not detected in the somatic cells of the ovaries in adult fish (Figure 7B and C). Interestingly, Dmrt1-positive signals were first detected in gonia-like cells that were scattered in the germinal epithelium and were found near POs at 12 dat in the MT-fed group, but were never observed in the control group (Figure 7D and E). Dmrt1 signals were also detected in SG at 24 dat (Figure 7F). Strong Dmrt1-positive signals were observed in the cells surrounding the SG and began to appear in primary SC at 36 dat (Figure 7G). At 96 dat, the positive signals were only observed in the primary and secondary SC and not in SG (Figure 7H and I).Tracing of Dmrt1-expressing cells during MT-feeding-induced sex reversal.

At 96 dat, the Dmrt1 is only detected in primary SC and second SC but not in the SG (black arrowheads) (H and I).

The process of AI-induced female-to-male sex reversal is a continual process of ovarian tissue degeneration and the reconstruction of testicular tissue during which the expression of male pathway genes slowly increases and the expression of female pathway genes gradually decreases [9]. The process and molecular mechanisms underlying exogenous steroid-induced sex reversal in hermaphroditic fish is less clear. In this study, we demonstrated that MT-feeding-induced sex reversal can be divided into early and late phases. In the early phase, the male and female germ cells coexist, and genes related to the female pathway are suppressed while genes related to the male pathway are activated. MT-feeding withdrawal in this phase leads to the development of the ovaries. In the late phase, only male germ cells are observed in the gonads, and the characteristics of the testes are maintained when MT-feeding is withdrawn. In the dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus), early transitional, bisexual, and late-transitional stages were classified based on the degeneration of female germinal cells, the proportion of male and female tissue, and the development of sperm sinuses along the gonadal wall during sex change [39]. In our study, we divided the sex reversal process into early and late stages based on whether the gonads contained oocytes and the gonads reverting back to ovaries after MT-feeding withdrawal.Previous studies showed that MT-feeding or AI treatment of immature Malabar grouper, E. malabaricus (120 days after hatching) and immature orange-spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides (10-month old) can induce sex change from immature ovary to testes, but the testes immediately changed back to immature ovaries after withdrawal of the MT or AI treatment [8, 40]. On the other hand, MT treatment is well known to induce sex change of matured female to functional males in grouper [41–44]. In this study, we used 1.5-year-old fish, and we found that MT-feeding-induced sex reversal can be divided into early and late phases, and MT-feeding withdrawal does not reverse the sex change process in the late phases. The above results suggest that the effect of MT treatment may vary with age and degree of sexual maturation.For many fishes, a balance between endogenous estrogens and androgens maintains their sexual identity. Steroidogenesis plays a critical role in fish sex determination and differentiation [45]. After MT treatment, the mRNA levels of cyp19a1a (which codes for a key enzyme in E2 synthesis) and the serum E2 levels decreased rapidly. However, the mRNA levels of cyp11b (which codes for a key enzyme in 11-KT synthesis) and serum 11-KT levels did not immediately show a significant increase. Therefore, MT treatment may directly inhibit the expression of the cyp19a1a gene in ovaries, resulting in a decrease in serum estrogen levels. Estrogen plays an important role in maintaining ovarian development [46], and decreased E2 levels may lead to the degradation of female germ cells. This could disrupt ovarian development, and the expression of male pathway genes in the gonads could then lead to sex reversal. The increase in steroidogenic enzymes as a result of increased cyp11b expression resulted in an increase in serum 11-KT levels, which may play a critical role in maintaining the testes. In agreement with this speculation, previous studies have found that the cyp11b gene is highly expressed only during the late stages of spermatogenesis [47, 48]. Therefore, the process of MT-induced sex reversal may be driven by the suppression of cyp19a1a expression, which has been observed in many other species.In this study, gene expression profiles of the dmrt1, sox9, cyp11b2, and cyp19a1a during MT-induced masculinization were similar to the previous studies [32, 40, 49]. Interestingly, we found that the expression of cyp19a1a was markedly increased after MT withdrawal. The molecular mechanism of how cyp19a1a expression is regulated by MT is largely unknown. MT as an agonist may activate androgen receptor (AR) to cause nucleus localization of AR [50]. In the nuclear, AR may bind to the cyp19a1a promoter or enhancer to recruit repressors thatcould decrease the cyp19a1a expression [51]. After the MT withdrawal, the repressive actions will be removed and the cyp19a1a expression will be upregulated. As a positive regulator, the foxl2 was reported to stimulate the cyp19a1a promoter in tilapia [52]. The cyp19a1a expression level was increased, while the foxl2 expression level was not significantly changed after MT withdrawal, suggesting that other factors may stimulate the cyp19a1a expression after MT withdrawal. Moreover, how brain functions were involved in the MT-induced sex reversal is largely unknown. In previous studies, we found that MT treatment could suppress the kiss1 and gnrh1 expression in the hypothalamus and the fshβ expression in the pituitary [16, 18]. Whether suppression of these genes is related to the decreased cyp19a1a expression needs further investigation.In this study, we found that the MT-feeding-induced male sex identity could be maintained after MT withdrawal at 96 dat but not at 36 dat, suggesting that the sex change induced by MT can be reversed at the early phase but not at the late phase. Consistent with the observation that MT can suppress cyp19a1a expression, MT withdrawal markedly increased the level of cyp19a1a mRNA in both the 36-day and 96-day MT-withdrawal groups. However, E2 levels were increased in the 36-day but not in the 96-day MT-withdrawal group. These different E2 levels may be due to the different gonadal status observed. In the 36-day MT-withdrawal group, ovarian cells could be still observed and thus may have maintained their ability to synthesize E2. Therefore, high levels of cyp19a1a expression could have led to high E2 levels. In the 96-day MT-withdrawal group, ovarian cells could not be observed. Although cyp19a1a was highly expressed, E2 may not be efficiently synthesized in the testes. Therefore, whether the MT-induced male fate could be further reversed after MT-feeding withdrawal may depend on whether E2 can be efficiently synthesized in the gonads. Compared to the gene expression at 36 dat, we found that the dmrt1, sox9, and cyp11b expression increased and the cyp19a1a expression decreased more profoundly in the stable sex-reversed fish at 96 dat. These results suggested that the increased expression of male fate favored genes and decreased expression of female fate favored gene may contribute to stable male sex status after female-to-male sex change.To further investigate the cellular changes that occur during MT-feeding-induced sex reversal in hermaphroditic fish, we examined Dmrt1-expressing cells during this process. Consistent with the findings of a previous study, the grouper Dmrt1 protein is mainly expressed in the germ cells of adult testes [36], and no Dmrt1 expression was detected in the ovaries. However, in the MT-fed fish, Dmrt1-positive signals were detected in gonia-like cells (12 dat) and later observed in SG (24 dat) and primary and secondary SC (96 dat), suggesting that these Dmrt1-positive cells may be the origin of the male germ cells during sex reversal. The putative germinal epithelium of grouper was morphologically similar to that reported in madaka [53], which includes the germinal cradle, early-stage germ cells, epithelial cells, and basement membrane (Supplementary Figure S1). Further characterization of grouper germinal epithelium with proper marker was highly warranted. In tilapia, the SG were transformed from oogonia or GSC-like cells located in germinal epithelium during female-to-male sex reversal [9]. These data suggest that the gonia-like cells in the germinal epithelium might be the major source of SG, and that Dmrt1 plays an important role in the process of spermatogenesis during MT-feeding-induced sex reversal.In conclusions, our study provides several insights into the process of MT-induced sex reversal in groupers. Firstly, MT-feeding-induced sex reversal can be divided into different phases. Secondly, the cyp19a1a expression is responsive to MT treatment, and the regulation of cyp19a1a expression might be important for the MT-treatment-induced sex reversal. Thirdly, the gonia-like cells in the germinal epithelium might be the major germ cell source for SG development in the testes during sex reversal.Google ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGrant Support: This work is supported by The National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31572596, 31672631), the Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation (2015A030313069, 2015A030313409), the Guangdong Provincial Science and Technology Program (2014B090905008), the Special Fund for Fisheries-Scientific Research of Guangdong Province (A201501A03, A201501A10, A201600A02), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (161gzd14, 161gpy35), the Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangzhou (No. 201607020014) and the YangFan Innovative & Entrepreneurial Research Team Project (No. 201312H10).Oxford University Press is a department of the University of Oxford.

In the present study, a protogynous hermaphroditic orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) dnd homologue (Ecdnd) was identified and characterized. Quantitative real-time PCR and in situ hybridization analysis revealed a dynamic and sexually dimorphic expression pattern in PGCs and germ cells of gonads. During sex changing, the Ecdnd transcript sharply increased in early transitional gonad, reached the highest level at late transitional gonad stage, and decreased after testis maturation. Visualization of zebrafish PGCs by injecting with RFP-Ecdnd-3′UTR RNA and GFP-zfnanos3-3′UTR RNA confirmed importance of Ecdnd 3′UTR for the PGC distribution. In addition, knockdown of EcDnd by using antisense morpholinos (MO) caused the ablation of PGCs in orange-spotted grouper. Therefore, the current data indicate that Ecdnd is essential for PGCs survival and may serve as a useful germ cell marker during gametogenesis in hermaphroditic grouper.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

StAR (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein), transferring the cholesterol from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner membrane, is the rate-limiting factor of steroidogenesis. 3βHSD (3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ5–Δ4 isomerase), converting Δ5-steroids into Δ4-steroids, is an important oxidoreductase in steroidogenesis. In the present study, StAR and 3βHSD1 were cloned and characterized from protogynous orange-spotted grouper. StAR cDNA contains an 861 bp open reading frame (ORF), encoding a predicted protein of 286 amino acids, and the ORF of 3βHSD1 was 1125 bp, encoding a predicted protein of 374 amino acids. The transcript of StAR was mainly expressed in gonad, while 3βHSD1 mRNA was predominantly detected in brain and gonad. In the previous study, we found the expression of GnIH mRNA level in male, as well as in 17 alpha-methyltestosterone (MT)-induced male fish was significantly higher than in female fish, this indicating that GnIH/GnIHR signaling might be involved in the regulation of sex reversal and male maintenance. In order to figure out the function of GnIH in steroidogenesis, the expression of StAR and 3βHSD1 regulated by GnIH was examined. In vitro study showed that treatment of cultured ovary fragments with gGnIH peptides significantly stimulated the expression of StAR and 3βHSD1. In addition, the mRNA levels of StAR and 3βHSD1 were significantly increased after intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) with gGnIH peptides. Moreover, during MT-induced sex change from female to male, the levels of StAR mRNA significantly increased by 5.2, 24.8 and 353.5 folds, and that of 3βHSD1 mRNA by 3.5, 32.5 and 55.4 folds at the 2nd, 4th and 6th week after MT implantation, respectively. Collectively, our results indicate that GnIH may be involved in the regulation of sex reversal or male maintenance by stimulating the expression of StAR and 3βHSD1 in protogynous grouper.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

In protogynous hermaphroditic orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides), the GnIH/GnIHR signaling pathway and its reproductive function have not been addressed yet. In this study, GnIH and GnIHR in orange-spotted grouper were characterized. gGnIH possessed three putative peptides (gGnIH-I, -II, -III), while gGnIHR showed the characteristics of G protein-coupled receptor and was clustered with GPR147. Functional assays demonstrated that three synthetic gGnIH peptides significantly decreased the forskolin-induced CRE promoter activity, but only gGnIH-I could significantly decrease SRE promoter activity in COS-7 cells transfected with gGnIHR. During the process of ovarian differentiation and development, gGnIH mRNA level in hypothalamus was low at the gonadal primordium stage with gonia, then increased significantly at the early differentiated gonad with primary growth oocytes, while decreased significantly at the developing gonads with cortical-alveolus and vitellogenic stage oocytes. During MT-induced sex reversal, gGnIH mRNA level in hypothalamus increased significantly when the fish completely reversed from female to male. However, gGnIHR mRNA level in pituitary decreased significantly in intersex and completely reversed male fish. Intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of three gGnIH peptides significantly decreased GnRH1 mRNA levels in hypothalamus, and gGnIH-II significantly inhibited synthesis of LHβ in pituitary. In summary, we firstly identified the GnIH/GnIHR signal in protogynous orange-spotted grouper, which might be involved in the regulation of the reproductive function of sex differentiation, gonadal development and sex reversal via regulating the synthesis of both GnRH and GtH.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

The action of androgens is mediated via androgen receptors (ARs). The present study reports the cloning of the cDNA sequence of the ar in the orange-spotted grouper, with high expression in testis and relatively low in subdivision of brain areas. The cDNA sequence of ar was 2358 bp, encoding a protein of 759 amino acids (aa). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the ar cDNA sequence was closely related to that of threespot wrasse (Halichoeres trimaculatus) and medaka (Oryzias latipes) arβ. As deduced from the phylogenetic tree and the high amino acid identity with the ARβ subtype of other teleosts, grouper ar seems to be more closely related to the beta than the alpha subtype cloned to date. In the first week after 17α-methyltestosterone (MT) implantation, the transcript levels of ar in the hypothalamus declined significantly, and consistently stayed at low level expression to the second week, but increased back to the control levels in the third and fourth week. In the gonad, the mRNA expression of ar was not changed in the first week compared with the control, but increased significantly in the second week, consistently reached the highest level in the third week, dropped slightly but still higher than that of the control in the fourth week. The expression pattern of ar in hypothalamus and gonad during MT-induced sex reversal suggests the involvement of ar in regulating this process in the orange-spotted grouper. The present study provides the data of the changes in the mRNA levels of ar during MT-induced sex reversal in detail to help understand the complicated signals under sex reversal.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

In the present study, three full-length ERs cDNA sequences were isolated from a protogynous teleost, the orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides), and were 2235 bp for gERα, 1967 bp for gERβ1 and 2158 bp for gERβ2, respectively. Phylogenetic and amino acid alignment analyses showed that each gER was clustered in the corresponding taxonomic groups of the perciformes and exhibited high evolutional conservation in functional domains. RT-PCR revealed that gERs expressed at different levels in all the obtained tissues. gERα highly expressed in mature ovaries, gERβ1 mainly expressed in immature ovaries and gERβ2 varied greatly during ovarian development. During female to male sex reversal induced by 17α-methyltestosterone (MT) implantation, gERα decreased gradually, gERβ1 increased gradually, and gERβ2 decreased firstly and recovered subsequently in male stage.

In this study, we cloned and characterized a β-defensin from pituitary cDNA library of a protogynous hermaphroditic orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides). Interestingly, the β-defensin was shown to be dominantly expressed in pituitary and testis by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, and its transcript level is significantly upregulated in reproduction organs from intersexual gonad to testis during the natural and artificial sex reversal. Promoter sequence and the responsible activity region analyses revealed the pituitary-specific POU1F1a transcription binding site and testis-specific SRY responsible site, and demonstrated that the pituitary-specific POU1F1a transcription binding site that locates between −180 and −208 bp is the major responsible region of grouper β-defensin promoter activity. Immunofluorescence localization observed its pituicyte expression in pituitary and spermatogonic cell expression in testis. Moreover, both in vitro antibacterial activity assay of the recombinant β-defensin and in vivo embryo microinjection of the β-defensin mRNA were shown to be effective in killing Gram-negative bacteria. And, its antiviral role was also demonstrated in EPC cells transfected with the β-defensin construct. Additionally, the antibacterial activity was sensitive to concentrations of Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+. The above intriguing findings strongly suggest that the fish β-defensin might play significant roles in both innate immunity defense and reproduction endocrine regulation.Citation: Jin J-Y, Zhou L, Wang Y, Li Z, Zhao J-G, Zhang Q-Y, et al.

Defensins, as 3- to 6-kDa cationic peptides, are important effect molecules. They can rapidly kill microorganism pathogens including bacteria [2], mycobacteria, fungi [3], and viruses [4]. Based on their cysteine disulphide bonding, defensins are classified into α-, β- and θ-defensins [5]. α- and β-defensins distribute broadly in plants [6], [7], invertebrate [8] and vertebrate animals [9], but θ-defensins are only expressed in rhesus macaque [10]. More than 30 defensins in human and mouse [11] and 14 β–defensins in birds [12], [13], [14] were identified, but only 3, 2 and 2 β-defensin genes were respectively found in zebrafish, Fugu and Tetraodon by using a database mining approach. In zebrafish, constitutive expression of 3 β-defensins had been analyzed in healthy adult tissues [15]. In rainbow trout, β-defensin-1 was proved to have antiviral activity [16], and β-defensin-2, β-defensin-3 and β-defensin-4 were inducible with polyI:C treatment [17]. In olive flounder, the multiple β-defensins could be induced by pathogenic exposure [18]. Recently, we cloned a novel medaka β-defensin, and revealed its antimicrobial activity-specific to Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, its immune modulation was demonstrated to be mediated by NF-κB and Sp1 [19].β-defensins have been revealed to have more other biological activities in addition to their broad-spectrum antimicrobial roles [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. For example, some β-defensins are chemoattractants for monocytes, lymphocytes and dendritic cells, which act as a link between innate and adaptive immune responses [25], [26], [27]. In Torenia fournieri, a unique plant with a protruding embryo sac, the defensin-like polypeptide LUTEs are pollen tube attractants secreted form synergid cells [28]. And, some testis- or epididymis-specific β-defensins, such as Bin1b [29] and EP2 [30], [31], [32], have been identified in mammals. These findings suggest that some β-defensins might be related to reproduction endocrine regulation.Several β-defensins have been identified in brain or testis [29], [33], [34], but both pituitary and testis-produced β-defensins have not been reported. In this study, we cloned and characterized a β-defensin from pituitary cDNA library of orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides), and revealed the dominant expression both in pituitary and testis. Moreover, we demonstrated its antibacterial activity and antiviral activity both in vitro and in vivo. Groupers, as protogynous hermaphroditic and sex reversal species [35], have been considered as good models to study sex differentiation and endocrine regulation [36], therefore, the dominant expression of pituitary and testis and the antimicrobial roles imply that the currently identified grouper β-defensin might play a pivotal role in reproduction endocrine regulation in addition to the innate host defense.A total of 103 ESTs were sequenced from the female orange-spotted grouper pituitary cDNA plasmid library, and 5 ESTs were revealed to have a high similarity with green puffer β-defensin-2 [15]. According to the EST sequences, we designed the primers and cloned the full-length cDNA of grouper β-defensin using RACE strategy. As shown in Fig. 1A, the full-length cDNA is 558 bp, consisting of a 28 bp 5′ UTR, a 338 bp 3′UTR and a 192 bp open reading frame which encodes 63aa (accession no. AY129305). The first N-terminal 21 aa is predicted as a signal peptide by signal P program (3.0 SERVER). The mature peptide contains 42 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 5.07 kDa. The theoretical isoelectric point is 8.92. And the calculated net charge is +4 at physiological environment (pH 7.4).(A) Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of grouper β-defensin. The signal peptide is underlined. (B) Multiple alignment of grouper β-defensin amino acid sequences with other β-defensin proteins from fish. They are green puffer β-defensin-1 (BN000873) and green puffer β-defensin-2 (BN000874), medaka β-defensin (EU676010), zebrafish β-defensin-1 (AM181358), zebrafish β-defensin-2 (AM181359) and zebrafish β-defensin-3(AM181360), rainbow trout β-defensin-1(AM282655), rainbow trout β-defensin-2 (FM212656), rainbow trout β-defensin-3 (FM212657) and rainbow trout β-defensin-4 (FM212658), tiger puffer β-defensin-1(BN000875), olive flounder β-defensin (GQ414989). The identity values are on the right. The six conservative cystine residues are marked by black box. (C) Phylogenetic tree of grouper β-defensin peptide with other fish β-defensins. The bootstrap values were generated by testing the tree 1000 times. (D) Schematic representation of genomic structure of grouper β-defensin and other seven fish β-defensins.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0012883.g001Multiple amino acid alignment reveals six completely conserved cysteines (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) and several highly conserved leucines (L) and glycines (G) among these fish β-defensins (Fig. 1B). The grouper β-defensin has highest (87.30%) amino acid identities to green puffer β-defensin-2, and has 84.13%, 63.49%, 58.46% and 57.14% amino acid identities to medaka β-defensin, rainbow trout β-defensin-2, zebrafish β-defensin-2 and zebrafish β-defensin-3 respectively. It has less than 30% identities to rainbow trout β-defensin-3, tiger puffer β-defensin-1, zebrafish β-defensin-1, green puffer β-defensin-1, rainbow trout β-defensin-1and olive flounder β-defensin. Phylogentic tree analysis reveals two branches. Grouper β-defensin, green puffer β-defensi-2, medaka β-defensin, zebrafish β-defensin-2, zebrafish β-defensin-3 and rainbow trout β-defensin-2 are clustered in one branch, while the other sequences form another branch (Fig. 1C).To analyze the genomic organization of grouper β-defensin, we amplified the genomic sequence (907 bp) from the muscle genome DNA. In comparison with the mRNA sequence, grouper β-defensin gene has three exons (87, 111 and 331 bp) and two introns (297 and 81 bp) (Fig. 1D), as found in other fish defensins, including green puffer β-defensin-2, medaka β-defensin, zebrafish β-defensin-1, zebrafish β-defensin-2, zebrafish β-defensin-3, tiger puffer β-defensin-1 and green puffer β-defensin-1. Unexpectedly, the two introns in zebrafish β-defensin-3 were 2426 bp and 2108 bp, larger than those of other fish defensins. Signal peptide is localized in the first and second exon. The C1, C2, C3 and C4 are localized in the second exon, and the C5 and C6 are localized in the last exon.Tissue distribution profiles of β-defensin expression are very various even between closely related species [37]. In this study, we firstly analyzed the adult tissue distribution of grouper β-defensin expression by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot. As shown in Fig. 2A and 2B, the grouper β-defensin transcript (Fig. 2A) and protein (Fig. 2B) are dominantly expressed both in pituitary and testis, and no any signals are detected from other analyzed tissues, including liver, kidney, spleen, fat, heart, muscle, telencephalon, cerebellum, midbrain, medulla oblongata and ovary.(A) Expression pattern analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blot (B). L: liver; K: kidney; S: spleen; F: fat; H: heart; Mu: muscle; P: pituitary; Hy: hypothalamus; Tn: telencephalon; C: cerebellum; MB: midbrain; MOB: medulla oblongata; O: ovary; T: testis. α-tubulin was employed as a positive control. (C) The specificity of anti-grouper β-defensin serum detected by Western blot and immunofluorescence (D). The sections of grouper sexual reversal gonad were immunostained by the anti-grouper β-defensin serum (a), the pre-adsorbed anti-grouper β-defensin serum with extra recombinant grouper β-defensin protein (b), and the pre-immuned rabbit serum (c) respectively. Red fluorescence stained by PI indicates the cellular nucleus.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0012883.g002Moreover, we evaluated the specificity of the anti-grouper β-defensin polyclonal antibody by Western blot and immunofluorescence respectively. As shown in Fig. 2C, the anti-grouper β-defensin antibody specifically recognizes an about 5.5 kDa protein in the pituitary extract (Fig. 2C-a), while pre-adsorbed antiserum (Fig. 2C-b) with the purified recombinant grouper β-defensin protein or the pre-immnune serum (Fig. 2C-c) can not detect the specific 5.5 kDa polypeptide in the same pituitary extract. Immunofluorescence localization was consistent with that of Western blot. As shown in Fig. 2D, strong immunofluorescence is detected by the anti-grouper β-defensin antibody in some spermatogonia from the intersexual gonad sections of the protogynous hermaphroditic red-spotted grouper (Fig. 2D-a), whereas no immunofluorescence signal is observed when using the pre-adsorbed antiserum with the purified recombinant grouper β-defensin protein for 16 h at 4°C (Fig. 2D-b) or using the pre-immuned serum (Fig. 2D-c) as primary antiserum. The data indicate that the antibody has high specificity to the grouper β–defensin.In normal physiological conditions, several mammal defensins are sensitive to androgen and are developmentally regulated [38], [39]. To reveal the association of grouper β-defensin expression with sex reversal, we firstly evaluated the transcript level in the pituitaries and gonads of groupers at different stages. As shown in Fig. 3, the grouper β-defensin transcript level is always abundant in the pituitaries of different stage red-spotted groupers with un-development gonad, mature ovary and mature testis (Fig. 3A), but the β-defensin transcript level is very various in the different stage gonads. Abundant grouper β-defensin transcript is observed in the testis of 1600 g-weight male, and only a few of transcript is detected in the gonad of 950 g-weight maturing female, whereas no any transcript is found in the gonads of 150 g-weight immature female, 450 g-weight developing female, and 700 g- weight maturing female (Fig. 3B). Previous anatomical and microscope observations have shown that the 1600 g-weight individual is mature male with testis containing sperms, whereas others were females with ovaries at different stages of oogenesis [40], [41].(A) The expression of grouper β-defensin in the pituitaries of grouper with gonads in different stages. The total RNAs of pituitaries were isolated from grouper with undevelopmental, mature ovary and mature testis respectively. (B) Differential expression of grouper β-defensin in different stage gonads of red-spotted grouper. The total RNAs of gonads were respectively isolated from the different gonad stages with different sizes: O1: immature ovary from 150 g body weight; O2: ovary with previtellogenic oocytes from 450 g body weight; O3: ovary with vitellogenic oocytes from 700 g body weight; O4: ovary with vitellogenic oocytes from 950 g body weight; T1: testis from 1600 g body weight. α-tubulin was used as control. (C) Expression of grouper β-defensin in different stage gonads of red-spotted grouper during artificial sex inversion. (a) RT-PCR analysis of grouper β-defensin expression. α-tubulin was amplified at the same conditions as a positive control in each sample. (b) The grouper β-defensin mRNA intensities as shown in (a) were analyzed by Band Leader Applification Software Ver. 3.0. Values represent the means ± S.D. of three separate experiments. C01 and C02: the gonads from two individuals before sex inversion experiment, W11, W12, W21, W22, W31, W32, W41, W42, W51, W52, W61 and W62: the gonads from two individuals after feeding with MT for week 1–6, respectively.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0012883.g003For the artificial sex reversal groupers, the total RNAs were isolated from the gonad tissues of two individuals that were randomly sampled in the MT feeding group [42] at weekly intervals, and were used for RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 3C, the grouper β-defensin starts to transcribe at the 4th week after MT feeding, and reaches to a peak level at the 5th week. The high up-regulation transcription level suggests that the grouper β-defensin might have a significant role in testis development and spermatogenesis.A 900 bp 5′-flanking sequence of grouper β-defensin was isolated from the grouper genome DNA. It includes a 28 bp non-coding region and a 872 bp putative promoter. The consensus TATA box motif is in the 25 bp upstream of the transcription start site. A total of 13 transcription binding sites, such as transcription factor II (TFIID), stimulating protein 1(SP1), activator protein 1(AP1), sry-related HMG box 5 (SOX5), interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), myeloid elf-1 like factor -2 (MEF-2), GATA binding factor-1 (GATA-1), sex-determining region Y (SRY) and pituitary specific pou domain transcription factor 1a (POU1F1a) [43], were predicted in the isolated grouper β-defensin promoter by TESS and MatInspector (Fig. 4A). In comparison with the reported medaka β-defensin promoter (19), the grouper β-defensin promoter has a pituitary-specific POU1F1a transcription binding site, and does not contain NF-κB binding site (Fig. 4B).(A) Sequence of grouper β-defensin promoter region.

The data shown are derived from a representative experiment reported as the mean (n = 3) ± SD.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0012883.g004To reveal the responsible regions of grouper β-defensin promoter activity, series 5′ deletion mutant constructs were constructed in pGL3-basic vector as described previously (19), and used to transiently transfect Ctenopharyngodon idellus ovary (CO) cells and epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells (44). As shown in Fig. 4C, a peak activity appears in the −209/+87 construct, and the normalized relative light units (RLU) exceeds 800, whereas in the +87/−179, the activity is the same to the control pGL3-basic. The data indicate that major responsible region of grouper β-defensin promoter activity ranges from −180 to −208. Therefore, the POU1F1a binding site in this region might be important for the pituitary-specific expression of grouper β-defensin.Following the above investigation, we used the anti-grouper β-defensin antibody to trace the expressed cells and distribution in the grouper pituitary, and Propidium Iodide staining for cellular nucleus was performed. As shown in Fig. 5, in comparison with strong TSH signal in the proximal pars distalis (PPD) [45] (Fig. 5A), the grouper β-defensin immunofluoresence signal is observed only in the neurohypophysis from the transversal section of grouper pituitary, and no any signal appears in the adenohypophysis, including proximal pars distalis (PPD) and rostral pars distalis (RPD) (Fig. 5B). And, higher magnification further revealed detail distribution characterization of the grouper β-defensin immunoreactive signal (Fig. 5C and 5D). The immunoreactive signals are scattered throughout the neurohypophysis, but it seems stronger in the posterior of pars nervosa than those of the anterior neurohypophysis. In the sagittal pituitary section, the positive cells are long and slender, resembling filament, in which cytoplasmic projections often extend between the nerve fibers (Fig. 5E and 5F). Obviously, the grouper β-defensin-expressed cells should be pituicytes, the typical cells in pituitary neurohypophysis, which implies the pivotal regulation role of grouper β-defensin in the pituitary.(A) TSH signals in the anterior pituitary.

Red fluresecence was stained by Propidium Iodide for cellular nucleus.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0012883.g005Subsequently, we investigated dynamic changes and cell localization of the grouper β-defensin by immunofluorescence in the grouper gonads at different stages from ovary to testis in the natural sex reversal process. As shown in Fig. 6, in the gonad of maturing female, which contains a lot of vitellogenic oocytes, the grouper β-defensin expression can not be detected by immunofluorescence (Fig. 6A). When the grouper initiates to sex reversal, the gonad begins to appear early transitional characters. The cysts of male germ cells, from spermatogonia to spermatozoa, appear in the edge of lobules. Strong grouper β-defensin immunofluorescence signal is observed in the cytoplasm of spermatogonia (Fig. 6B). Following further sex reversal, oocytes reduce largely in number, and along with spermatogonium increase, the grouper β-defensin expression level increases rapidly (Fig. 6C). When the gonad completely changes to testis, the strong grouper β-defensin immunofluorescence is still detected in the spermatogonia, and some residual grouper β-defensin fluorescence is observed in primary spermatocytes (Fig. 6D). The data indicate that grouper β-defensin is expressed by spermatogonia in testis, suggesting that it might play an important role in sex reversal and spermatogenesis.(A) Ovary section; (B) Gonad section at the early sex reversal stage; (C) Gonad section at intersex stage; (D) Testis section. PO: previtellogenic oocyte; SG: spermatogonia; PSP: primary spermatocytes; SSP: secondary spermatocytes; SPZ: spermatozoa. Red fluresecence was stained by Propidium Iodide for the nuclei.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0012883.g006Recombinant plasmids pET-28-grouper β-defensin was transformed into E. coli BL21. After IPTG (0.8 mM) induction for 4 h, the recombinant grouper β-defensin proteins (9 kDa) were expressed mostly in the insoluble fractions, but not in the supernatants of bacterial cells after disruption by sonication. After purified by the denaturing conditions, more than 95% purity recombinant grouper β-defensin protein was obtained. The yield of the purified grouper β-defensin protein was about 5 mg/L broth.Since grouper β-defensin has very high identity to green puffer β-defensin and medaka β-defensin, we firstly used the purified recombinant grouper β-defensin protein to perform antibacterial analysis in eight strains of bacteria, including six Gram-negative strains (E. coli, V. fluvialis, B. cereus, P. aeruginosa, V. anguillarum and A. sobria) and two Gram-positive strains (S. aureus and M. luteus). Similarly to medaka β-defensin, the purified recombinant grouper β-defensin also exhibited higher antibacterial activity to Gram-negative bacteria than to Gram-positive bacteria. Under high concentration of 512 µg/ml, the survival rates of all eight strains were lower than 10%, but in comparison with Gram-positive strains, lower concentration was sufficient to resist against Gram-negative strains (Fig. 7A). Moreover, we calculated the protein concentrations that killed 50% (vLD50) and 90% bacteria (vLD90). As shown in Table 1, the vLD50 (5.1±0.4 to 8.8±0.5) and vLD90 (17.5±4.0 to 59.4±8.8) in Gram-negative strains were much lower than that in Gram-positive strains (vLD50 from 53.1±2.1 to 53.9±4.7, vLD90 from 296.5±65.5 to 358.5±46.5). The data indicated that grouper β-defensin should have more strong effect to kill Gram-negative bacteria than to kill Gram-positive bacteria.(A) Antimicrobial activities of grouper β-defensin in vitro to eight different strains (shown in respective chart). X-axis indicates the protein gradient concentration (µg/ml) and the Y-axis shows the survival rate (means ± SD). At least three independent experiments were conducted. (B) Effects of NaCl, KCl, CaCl2 and MgCl2 concentration on the antimicrobial activity of grouper β-defensin. E.coli were incubated for 12 h with 64 µg/ml grouper β-defensin in the culture medium containing various concentration ions. Values shown are mean ± SD. (C) Antimicrobial activity of grouper β-defensin in vivo. (a) Western blot was employed to detect the expression of grouper β-defensin by embryos. (b) At 24hpf, the control embryos injected with pure water and embryos injected grouper β-defensin mRNA were challenged with the Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio flurialis and Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus, respectively. The survival rates were recorded at the indicated times after infection. The experiments were repeated three times with 70 embryos per group.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0012883.g007https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0012883.t001β-defensins have been shown to be inactivated at high salt concentrations[46]. To determine whether antibacterial activity of grouper β-defensin is similarly affected, salt sensitivity assays were implied. Since 64 µg/ml purified recombinant grouper β-defensin proteins can almost fully inhibit the growth of E.coli, we used this concentration for the later salt effect examinations. The concentration of Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ were adjusted with NaCl, KCl, CaCl2 and MgCl2, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7B, the bactericidal activity was suppressed by the increasing concentrations of all salts. The antibacterial activity of grouper β-defensin was substantially diminished at high concentration of NaCl (150 mM) and KCl (300 mM). In comparison, the antimicrobial activity of grouper β-defensin was more sensitive to CaCl2 and MgCl2. The ability of grouper β-defensin to inhibit growth of E. coli diminished about fifteen fold when divalent cations concentrations were increased from 0 mM to 0.2 mM.To investigate the antibacterial activity of grouper β-defensin in vivo, we injected grouper β-defensin mRNA or pure water into rare gudgeon embryos, respectively. Then the two groups of embryos were exposed to pathogen bacterium V. flurialis or M. luteus by static immersion. Similar to the results in vitro, grouper β-defensin has more strong effect to kill Gram-negative bacterium V. flurialis than to kill Gram-positive bacterium M. luteus. As shown in Fig. 7C, the expressed β-defensin protein can be detected by Western blot in the embryos injected with β-defensin mRNA, and the survival rates are about twice higher in the grouper β-defensin mRNA injected embryos than in the control wild-type embryos when the two groups of embryos are infected by Vibrio flurials, whereas no any significant difference is observed when the two group embryos are infected by Micrococcus luteus.Moreover, we analyzed the antiviral role of grouper β-defensin in cells by transfection assays. Firstly, EPC cells were transfected for 24 h with 0.5 µg of grouper β-defensin construct pcDNA3.1-grouper β-defensin or empty vector (pcDNA3.1) as control, and the successful transfection was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot detection of grouper β-defensin mRNA and protein (Fig. 8A). Then the transfected cells were infected with 105, 104, 103 and 102 TCID50/ml of an iridovirus Rana grylio virus (RGV) [47], respectively. When obvious cytopathogenic effect (CPE) was produced for 48 h incubation in the control cells transfected with empty vector pcDNA3.1, significantly, only less CPE was found in the pcDNA3.1-grouper β-defensin-transfected cells (Fig. 8B). Fig. 8C shows the virus yields between the two group cells under different virus dose infection, and the virus yields in the pcDNA3.1-grouper β-defensin-transfected cells are significantly lower than that in the control cells transfected with empty vector pcDNA3.1.(A) EPC cells seeded in 24-well plates were transfected for 24 h with 0.5 µg of pcDNA3.1-grouper β-defensin or pcDNA3.1 as control. Grouper β-defensin mRNA and the protein was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot respectively, and (B) the other group of transfected was challenged with RGV with different dose (105 TCID50/ml, 104 TCID50/ml, 103 TCID50/ml and 102 TCID50/ml), respectively. 48 h later, cells were then stained with crystal violet for detection of CPE, and (C) the culture supernatants were collected to detect the virus titers. (D) EPC cells seeded in 24-well plates were transfected for 24 h with pcDNA3.1-grouper β-defensin or pcDNA3.1 at dose of 1 µg, 0.5 µg, 0.25 µg and 0.1 µg, respectively. Grouper β-defensin mRNA and the protein was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot respectively, and (E) the other of transfected cells was challenged with RGV at multiplicity of infection 103 TCID50/ml. 48 h later, cells were then stained with crystal violet for detection of CPE, and (F) the culture supernatants were collected to detect the virus titers. The data shown is a representative of three independent experiments. Differences between control cells and grouper β-defensin transfected cells are significant *p<0.05.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0012883.g008Furthermore, EPC cells were transiently transfected with different doses of grouper β-defensin construct or empty vector (pcDNA3.1), and the expressed β-defensin mRNA and protein were confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot detection (Fig. 8D). Following the infection of transiently transfected cells with 103 TCID50/ml RGV, CPE was observed, and the viral yields were determined. As shown in Fig. 8E, almost no CPE is found in cells transfected with 1 µg or 0.5 µg of grouper β-defensin construct. In contrast, obvious CPE is observed in control cells that were transfected with empty vector pcDNA3.1. Additionally, virus yield estimation also revealed significant differences between the two group cells. In control cells, the difference of virus yields was slight when the cells were transfected with 1 µg, 0.5 µg, 0.25 µg and 0.1 µg empty vector pcDNA3.1. In the pcDNA3.1-grouper β-defensin transfected cells, there was a gradual elevation in virus titers along with the decrease of the trasfected plasmid concentration (Fig. 8F). The results together indicate that grouper β-defensin has antiviral role in against the RGV iridovirus infection.A significant and intriguing finding in this study is the dominant expression of grouper β-defensin both in pituitary and testis. The first vertebrate β-defensin was identified in bovine tracheal mucosa [48]. Since then, more and more β-defensins were isolated from other vertebrates, such as human [49], mouse [2], avian [12] and fish [15]. Generally, the tissue distribution of β-defensins is extensive and diverse. These molecules are mostly produced by tissues involved in host defense [26]. In the current study, we cloned and characterized a β-defensin from the pituitary SMART cDNA library of grouper, and found that the β-defensin is simultaneously expressed both in the grouper pituitary and testis (Fig. 3). It was well known that hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis is an important neuro-endocrine system for regulating vertebrate reproduction and sex differentiation [50]. Several β-defensins had been detected in brain [33], [34] or male reproductive tract [29], [39], but the expression both in pituitary and testis is the first finding. Some epididymis-specific β-defensins also possess other function more than antimicrobial activity. For examples, Bin1b, a natural epididymis-specific β-defensin in rat, was demonstrated to be important for the sperm mature in rat [23], [29]. ESP13.2, produced by macaque epididymis, was confirmed to have a function in the sperm capacitation process [51]. Therefore, the dominant expression of grouper β-defensin both in pituitary and testis implies that the grouper β-defensin might play a significant role in the endocrine regulation and sex differentiation.Moreover, promoter sequence and the responsible activity region analyses revealed the pituitary-specific POU1F1a transcription binding site and testis-specific SRY responsible site in the grouper β-defensin promoter, and demonstrated that the pituitary-specific POU1F1a transcription binding site was major responsible region of grouper β-defensin promoter activity (Fig. 4). However, the POU1F1a is a pituitary-specific transcription factor, it could not be expressed in the CO and EPC cells. Significantly, the POU1F1a has been revealed to belong to the POU domain transcription factor family that includes POU1F1, Oct-1, and Oct-2, and these factors share a highly conserved bipartite DNA-binding domain. And, Oct-1 has been demonstrated as a ubiquitously expressed factor [52]. Therefore, it is suggested that the ubiquitous Oct-1 should be expressed both in CO cells and EPC cells, and the high promoter activity might be resulted by the binding of the ubiquitous Oct-1 and the POU1F1a site.According to a previous study from our laboratory, NF-κB binding site was important for medaka β-defensin response to LPS [19]. And, this binding site was also crucial for inducing human β-defensin 2 by LPS in RAW264.7 cells [53]. Furthermore, we used anti-grouper β-defensin serum to localize pituicyte expression in pituitary (Fig. 5) and spermatogonium expression in testis (Fig. 6). Unlike other β-defensins widely distributed in many tissues [15], [16], [19], the expression of grouper β-defensin in grouper pituicytes and spermatogonium might constitute an essential component in maintaining the endocrine regulation and sex reversal process.Most β-defensins have been demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity [54]. Some of them, such as mouse β-defensin 1 [2] and human β-defensin 3 [55], can kill both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Some are specific to Gram-negative bacteria, such as human β-defensin 1 [46], human β-defensin 2 [56] and medaka β-defensin [19]. In this study, we demonstrated that the grouper β-defensin have the antibacterial activity-specific to Gram-negative bacteria, and the activity ability reduces along with the increase of salt concentration (Fig. 7), which is similar to other β-defensins, such as mouse BD-1[2] and human BD-1[46]. Additionally, the grouper β-defensin also exhibits antiviral activity against RGV, an iridovirus. Although there are many reports on β-defensin against virus infection [57], [58], in fish, only Falco et al. demonstrated that rainbow trout β-defensin-1 exhibited antiviral activity against viral haemorrhagic septicaemia rhabdorvirus (VHSV) [16]. Therefore, the dual roles for antibacterium and antivirus imply that the grouper β-defensin might play significant roles in immunity defense of reproduction endocrine regulation.In conclusion, we have identified and characterized a fish β-defensin from the protogynous hermaphrodite grouper, revealed its dominant expression both in pituitary and testis, and demonstrated the dual roles for antibacterium and antivirus. The expression pattern in reproduction axis and the dual roles for antibacterium and antivirus might be related to the sex reversal in the grouper fish. Perhaps, our current findings open the door for understanding the reproduction and endorcrine regulation roles of β-defensin in fish, although this issue remains to be investigated more clearly.Total RNA of pituitary was isolated from 4-year-old orange-spotted grouper by SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega). SMART cDNAs were synthesized and amplified using the Switching Mechanism At 5′-end of RNA Transcript (SMART) cDNA Library Construction Kit (Clontech) as described previously [19], [40], [42], [59]. The plasmid cDNA library was plated to appropriate density to pick individual colonies. By screening 103 clones, five clones showing conserved β-defensin characteristic were sequenced. Signal peptide was predicted by SignalP 3.0 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/). The isoelectric point (PI), molecular weight (MW) and the net charge were calculated by ProtParam (http://www.expasy.ch/tools/). ClustalW (http://align.genome.jp/) was used to align multiple fish defensins, and the identity percentages were generated by Bioedit. A phylogenetic tree was constructed by using the Neighbour-Joining (NJ) algorithm based on the deduced amino acid sequences.The genomic DNA fragment of grouper β-defensin was amplified from the total genomic DNA isolated from orange-spotted grouper muscle as described previously [60]. The genomic sequences were obtained in ensemble database (http://www.ensembl.org). All putative promoters were predicted by the 1999 Neural Network Promoter Prediction (NNPP version 2.2) (http://www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/promoter.html). The potential transcription factor binding sites were identified by TESS and MatInspector.Total RNAs of liver, kidney, spleen, fat, heart, muscle, pituitary, hypothalamus, telecephalon, cerebellum, midbrain and medulla oblongata were isolated from 1-year-old orange-spotted grouper with immature ovary using SV Total RNA Isolation System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Total RNAs of pituitaries were isolated from grouper with undeveloped gonads, mature ovary and mature testis respectively. Total gonad RNAs were isolated from red-spotted grouper with body weight of 150, 450, 700, 950 and 1600 g, respectively. Total RNAs of gonads at the different artificial sex inversion stages were isolated from 14 individuals of red-spotted grouper [42]. Then RNAs were respectively reverse-transcribed with M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) and oligo(dT)8–12 (Promega) as described by the manufacturer. According to the obtained nucleotide sequences, one pair of primers (BDF1/BDR1, Table 2) were synthesized (Sangon, Shanghai) and used to analyze adult tissue distribution and temporal expression in gonads at different developmental stages. The semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed in a volume of 25 µl at the optimal conditions as follows: 94°C for 4 min, 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s for 32 cycles followed by 72°C for 5 min. β-tubulin (tubulin-F/tubulin-R, Table 2) was amplified to provide a semi-quantitative control for PCR reaction efficiency under the same reaction conditions as grouper β-defensin.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0012883.t002To further analyze the expression differences of grouper β-defensin at different stages of artificial sex reversal, image analysis was used to measure the intensity of the RT-PCR products by the software package GeneSnap (MwLibrary, Genius).Primers BDF2 and BDR2 (Table 2) were synthesized to generate a sequence for encoding the mature β-defensin peptide, and then the generated sequence was inserted into the expression vector pET-28a (+). After the construct was transformed to competent BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells and the positive clones were selected on Luria Bertani (LB) medium containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin, recombinant protein could be induced to over-express in the E. coli by 0.8 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactoside (IPTG) for 4 h at 37°C. Because it formed insoluble inclusion bodies during expression, the recombinant grouper β-defensin protein was not lethal for the E. coli. After it was purified with His-tag purification kit (Novagene, USA), the recombinant protein was refolded by dialysis against 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (PH 7.4) 4 times at 4°C. The disulphide bonds-related issues and the antimicrobial activity can be solved by the dialysis as described previously [61]. Tricine-SDS-PAGE was carried out to assess the purity of recombinant protein. The concentration of recombinant grouper β-defensin was measured by the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, USA) as per the manufacture's direction. Because no any antimicrobial activity difference was revealed between the recombinant defensin proteins with his-tag and without his-tag by previous studies [61], [62], the recombinant grouper β-defensin protein with a N-terminal his-tag was directly used as antimicrobial activity assays.To acquire polyclonal antiserum, the recombinant proteins were applied to immunize white rabbit as described previously [40], [41], [56]. The specificity of the antiserum was evaluated by Western blot and immunofluorescence. Two controls were designed to determine polyclonal antibody specificity. In one control the grouper β-defensin antisera were replaced with pre-immune serum respectively. In another control the grouper β-defensin antisera was replaced by antisera pre-adsorbed with purified recombinant grouper β-defensin for 16 h at 4°C. The preadsorption was carried as described previously [40], [41], [59].Western blot was performed to analyze the adult tissue distribution of grouper β-defensin. The healthy grouper tissues were homogenized in 1 ml of chilled RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Deoxycholic acid, 1 mM EDTA, 1 µg/ml peupeptin, 25 µg/ml aprotinin and 1 mg/ml PMSF). Protein concentration was determined by the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, USA) according the instruction. 50 µg protein of samples from liver, kidney, spleen, fat, heart, muscle, pituitary, hypothalamus, telencephalon, cerebellum, midbrain, medulla oblongata, ovary, and testis were loaded into each lane with a ultra-low molecular weight protein size Marker (Kayon, Shanghai), electrophoresed through 16% Tricine-SDS-PAGE, then electroblotted onto PVDF membrane (Whatman, USA) using a Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad, USA). Blotting was performed according to the procedure as described previously [63], [64].Immunofluorescence were performed to analyze grouper β-defensin celluar localization in pituitary and gonads at different development stages. The procedure was according to a previous report [19], [65].To further analyze the regulation of grouper β-defensin expression, we cloned the its upstream region with the Universal GenomeWalker™ Kit (Clontech). As previously described [66], we isolate the promoter by using primers four pair primers (GSP1a/AP1, GSP1b/AP2, GSP2a/AP1, GSP2b/AP2). Series of PCR fragment were generated by PCR with 11 forward primers containing SacI and a reverse primer containing XhoI (Table 2). All the 5′ deletion constructs were verified by sequencing.CO cells and EPC cells were transfected with 0.5 µg series plasmid and 0.025 µg pRL-TK as internal control, while pGL3-basic was used for negative control. After transfection for 24 h, Luciferase activities were detected with a Junior LB9509 Luminometer (Berthold, German) and normalized to the amount of Renilla luciferase activities. The results showed the representative of more than three independent experiments performed in triplicates.Escherichia coli (AB91012, CCTCC), Micrococcus luteus (AB91100, CCTCC), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (AB91095, CCTCC), Bacillus cereus (AB93071, CCTCC) and Staphylococcus aureus (AB94004, CCTCC) were from China Center for Type Culture Collection (CCTCC, Wuhan). Vibrio fluvialis, Vibrio anguillarum and Aeromonas sobria were gifted by professor Ai-hua Li (Institute of Hydrobiology, CAS). Antibacterial activity assay was performed by microtitre broth dilution method [61], [67]. Briefly, mid-log-phase cultures of test strains were diluted to approximately 2×106 CFU/ml in 2×MHB. 50 µl of these cultures were treated with 50 µl gradient concentration recombinant grouper β-defensin in 96-well microplates, while 50 µl 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (8.0) was used as a control. The bacteria growth was determined by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm (OD600). Initial OD600 values were measured and recorded. Then these plates were incubated for 12 h at their optimal growth temperature, respectively (S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and E. coli at 37°C, B. cereus at 30°C, V. anguillarum, A. sobria, M. luteus and V. fluvialis, at 28°C). OD600 was measured and imported into Microsoft excel software and corrected by initial OD600 values. Survival rates were calculated as the cell density in the presence of grouper β-defensin to the cell density of control. Virtual 50% lethal dose (vLD50) and vLD90 were reported as the grouper β-defensin concentrations that resulted in survival rates of 0.5 and 0.1, respectively. Assay was performed more than three times and the statistical data were shown.Salt sensitivity of grouper β-defensin protein was tested by adding various ions into the culture medium. 1×106 CFU/ml E.coli were incubated with 64 µg/ml grouper β-defensin protein containing different concentrations of salts (0–300 mM NaCl or KCl, 0–0.2 mM CaCl2 or MgCl2).Grouper β-defensin ORF was subcloned into the pCS2+ vector for in vitro transcription. After Not I digestion in pCS2+-grouper β-defensin, capped sense RNAs were synthesized using SP6 RNA polymerase and the SP6 Cap-Scribe (Roche, Switzerland). Following the manufacture's instructions, mRNAs were resuspended in water and injected 1 µl to an embryo at a concentration of 200 ng/µl. The expression of grouper β-defensin protein was detected by Western blot.For bacterial infection, rare gudgeon (Gobiocypris rarus) embryos were manually dechorionated at 24 hpf after injected with 1 µl of the groupr β-defensin mRNA. As wild type control, the fertilized eggs were also injected with 1 µl of water. Then all the embryos were exposed to pathogen bacterium Vibrio flurialis (108 CFU/ml) or Micrococcus luteus (108 CFU/ml) by static immersion as described previously [68]. Embryos were maintained with fresh water after immersion for 4 h. After 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hpi (hours post infection), the survival rates were counted. The experiments were repeated three times with 70 embryos per group.CO cells and EPC cells were maintained in TC199 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 ug/ml streptomycin at 25°C. Transfection assay was performed as described previously [44], [69]. The PCR products amplified by primers (BDF3/BDR3, Table 2) inserted into pcDNA3.1(-) vector to generate pcDNA3.1-grouper β-defensin. When they were grown to 90% confluence, EPC cells were transiently transfected with various concentration of pcDNA3.1-grouper β-defensin or empty vector pcDNA3.1(-) using the Fugene (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The expression of grouper β-defensin was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. 24 h after transfection, the cells of each well were washed three times and treated with various concentration of RGV. After infection for 48 h, the supernatants were harvested from plates freezed and thawed for three times. For determining the titer of RGV, the supernatants were serially diluted in free-serum medium and titrated on EPC cells. Each dilution was assayed in three replicates.All data are presented as mean ±S.E. Differences between groups were analyzed by t-test. Data were considered have significantly different when P<0.05.Conceived and designed the experiments: LZ JFG. Performed the experiments: JYJ ZL JGZ. Analyzed the data: JYJ LZ.

Wrote the paper: JYJ JFG.PLOS is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) corporation, #C2354500, based in San Francisco, California, USThe Kiss1/Kiss1r system is a component of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, which plays a crucial role in regulating gonadotropins and gonadotropin-releasing hormone. The sex reversal process is a special reproductive phenomenon regulated by the HPG axis. To better understand the neuroendocrine mechanisms of sex reversal, cDNAs encoding kiss2 and kiss1ra have been cloned and functionally characterized from the orange-spotted grouper Epinephelus coioides, a protogynous hermaphroditic teleost. The core mature peptide (Kiss2-10) of grouper Kiss2 shared high similarity to other KISS orthologs. In phylogenetic analyses, the grouper Kiss was clustered with the teleost Kiss2 clade and termed grouper kiss2. The predicted amino acid sequence of grouper kiss1ra contained three putative glycosylation sites at its N-terminus, showing high similarity to that of other teleosts. Synthesized Kiss2-10 was able to functionally interact with Kiss1ra in cultured COS-7 cells to trigger downstream signaling. Both kiss2 and kiss1ra mRNAs were expressed in all tissues examined, with highest levels in the olfactory bulb and moderate levels in the hypothalamus among brain areas and highest levels in ovary among peripheral tissues. Intraperitoneal injection of Kiss2-10 significantly increased gnrh1 mRNA levels in hypothalamus and follicle-stimulating hormone beta (fshb) mRNA levels in the pituitary at 6 and 12 h postinjection. During the process of sex reversal induced by 17 alpha-methyltestosterone (MT), kiss2 and kiss1ra mRNA expression were significantly decreased in the first week, but kiss2 increased in the fourth week, in accordance with the expression pattern of gnrh1 mRNA in the grouper hypothalamus. This is the first description of the Kiss2/Kiss1ra system during MT-induced sex reversal in orange-spotted grouper.KISS1 is a neuropeptide identified as an endogenous ligand of the G protein-coupled receptor KISS1R (previously GPR54) [1]. Previous studies have shown that the KISS1/KISS1R system plays pivotal roles in the onset of puberty [2], sex differentiation [3], and other reproductive activities, such as the estrous cycle [4], ovulation [5], and pregnancy [6]. The discovery of the KISS1/KISS1R system has greatly enhanced our knowledge of the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanisms involved in reproduction.KISS1 regulates gonadotropin secretion via the stimulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GNRH) secretion [7]. KISS1-containing neurons have been demonstrated to project to areas where GnRH neurons are known to reside in the mouse brain [8]. KISS1R colocalizes with GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus [7]. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of KISS1 increases GNRH secretion followed by gonadotropin release [7]. This KISS1-induced gonadotropin release can be blocked by pretreatment with GNRH antagonists, such as acyline [8] or cetrorelix [5].The KISS1/KISS1R system is a missing link for understanding the feedback regulation of GNRH secretion by sex steroids [4, 9]. Both estrogen and androgen receptors have been observed in KISS1-expressing neurons [10], and it is well characterized that hypothalamic expression of the KISS1 gene is under the control of sex steroids in rodents [11], sheep [11], and primates [12].To date, most studies on KISS1 and KISS1R have been carried out in mammals, but increasing attention is being paid to nonmammalian vertebrates, particularly fish. Since the first cloning in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in 2004 [13], kiss1r genes from other species of fish, including cobia (Rachycentron canadum) [14] and grey mullet (Mugil cephalus), have been characterized and proven to be involved in regulating gnrh and pubertal development [15]. These findings indicate that the structure and function of Kiss1r protein are highly conserved. Although kiss1 was first found in zebrafish (Danio rerio) [16], the first characterization of kiss1 and its regulation by steroid hormone were reported in medaka (Oryzias latipes) [17]. Subsequently, kiss1 was identified from the other teleost species seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) [18] and goldfish (Carassius auratus) [19]. Recently, two kiss genes, namely, kiss1 and kiss2, and two kiss1r genes have been found in zebrafish [20, 21], medaka [17, 21], and goldfish [19]. There are species differences concerning the occurrence of kiss1 and kiss2 genes and the predominance of the two kiss systems for hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis regulation. Kiss2 peptide facilitates luteinizing hormone, beta polypeptide (lhb) and follicle-stimulating hormone, and beta polypeptide (fshb) mRNA expression in the pituitary of sexually mature female zebrafish [21]. In seabass, the two kiss genes are able to induce both Lh and Fsh secretion [18]. However, in sexually mature female goldfish, intraperitoneal administration of Kiss1-10, but not Kiss2-10, significantly increases serum Lh levels [19]. The occurrence of multiple kiss and kiss1r has also been found in Xenopus [22]. These data suggested a structural and functional multiplicity of the Kiss1/Kiss1r system in nonmammalian vertebrates.Sex reversal in marine hermaphrodite fish is a common phenomenon. Gnrh, Lh/Fsh, gonadal steroids, and other neuroendocrine and gonadal factors are involved in the regulation of sex reversal [23]. Previous studies have convincingly demonstrated that sex steroid hormones can induce a complete sex reversal from male to female in protandrous fish [24] or female to male in protogynous fish [25]. In the orange-spotted grouper, 17α-methyltestosterone (MT)-induced sex reversal is associated with a significant decrease in expression of the pituitary fshb subunit [25]. Dusky anemonefish (Amphiprion melanopus), a protandrous fish, has a greater number of GnRH-ir cells during the male phase than the female phase [26]. Similar changes in the anatomy of the GnRH system have also been found in a female to male sex-changing labrid fish, the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) [27]. Moreover, Gnrh in combination with the dopamine receptor antagonist domperidone (DOM) induces sex reversal in female Synbranchus marmoratus Bloch [28]. These studies demonstrate the importance of the HPG axis in sex reversal. It is known that the Kiss1/Kiss1r system plays a pivotal regulatory role for the HPG axis; however, whether it is involved in sex reversal in fish needs investigation.To address this issue, orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides), a protogynous species, was employed in the present study. First, the cDNA sequences encoding kiss2 and kiss1ra were cloned and characterized. Second, the tissue distribution and downstream signal transduction pathways were investigated. Third, expression of gnrh1, gnrh3, fshb, and lhb mRNAs following intraperitoneal injection of grouper Kiss2 decapeptides (Kiss2-10) were measured to evaluate the functional role of kiss2 in stimulating the hypothalamus-pituitary axis. Finally, expression profiles of kiss2, kiss1ra, as well as gnrhs in hypothalamus during MT-induced sex reversal were also examined.Three-year-old female orange-spotted groupers (body weight, 1.3–2.2 kg; body length, 37.5–52.5 cm) were obtained from Guangdong Daya Bay Fishery Development Center (Huizhou City, Guangdong, P.R. China) in June 2008. Fish were cannulated individually through the genital pore to collect gonadal tissue in order to confirm the female stage and then cultured in floating net cages in the sea under natural conditions from June to August at temperatures ranging from 26.5 to 29.6°C. The fish were fed with frozen trash fish once a day. Fish were killed by decapitation, and tissues were dissected, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at −80°C until RNA extraction. The use of animals in this study has been approved by the respective Animal Research and Ethics Committees of Sun Yat-Sen University, and all experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the committee.The core sequence of orange-spotted grouper kiss2 (FNFNPFGLRF-NH2, Kiss2-10) was synthesized by Ningbo Fish Hormone Factory, Zhejiang Province, China. The purity was 95% as determined by analytical HPLC. The rat KISS-10 was purchased from Phoenix BioTech. The MT and the methanesulfonate (MS222) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.Total RNA from orange-spotted grouper hypothalamus was prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen). One microgram of isolated RNA was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA using the ReverTra Ace-α First-strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Toyobo). To amplify cDNA fragments of the grouper kiss2 gene, degenerate PCR primers were designed based on 10 conserved amino acids from the medaka, fugu, and Gasterosteus putative Kiss2 proteins. To obtain a cDNA fragment for kiss1ra, RT-PCR was carried out using pairs of oligonucleotide primers. Full-length cDNA sequences encoding kiss2 and kiss1ra were obtained by the 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) kit (Invitrogen). All primers for orange-spotted grouper kiss2 and kiss1ra used in the present study are listed in Table 1.Gene-specific primers used for RT-PCR analysis.aAll primer pairs were designed to originate in different exons to exclude false positive bands in case of potential genomic DNA contamination.ORF, open reading frame; AAP, abridged anchor primer; AUAP, abridged universal anchor primer.Mixed bases: K = G + T, S = G + C, V = A + G + C, R = G + A, W = A + T, Y = C + T, B = G + C + T, M = A + C.For all PCR reactions, amplifications were performed as follows: denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94°C for 15 sec, 52–58°C for 15 sec, and 72°C for 1–1.5 min. The reaction was ended by a further extension of 10 min at 72°C. The amplification products were purified using the E.Z.N.A. Gel Extraction Kit (Omega BioTek) and subcloned into the pTZ57R/T vector (Fermentas). Three different individual positive clones were sequenced on an ABI 3700 sequencer (Applied Biosystems).Putative signal peptides and cleavage sites were predicted using SignalP 3.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP). Putative seven-transmembrane domains were predicted using TMHMM Server v. 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0). Multiple sequence alignments of amino acids were performed with ClustalX (1.81). Protein phylogenetic analysis was conducted with MEGA4 using the neighbor-joining method.Grouper kiss1ra and rat Kiss1r were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). The COS-7 cell line was purchased from ATCC. Cells were maintained at 37°C in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. Twenty hours before transfection, 1.5 × 105 cells/well were seeded into 24-well tissue-culture plates. Next, 500 ng of pSRE-Luc or pCRE-luc (Stratagene), 100 ng pcDNA-kiss1ra or pcDNA-Kiss1r, and 50 ng pRL-CMV (for normalization of transfection efficiency) containing the Renilla luciferase reporter gene were cotransfected into cells in 250 μl of serum-free medium using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Six hours after transfection, cells were incubated with vehicle or gradient concentrations (from 10−10 to 10−6 M) of Kiss2-10 and rat KISS-10 for a further 20 h. Cells were harvested and luminescence was measured on a Lumat LB 9501 luminometer (EG & G), and the activities of both luciferases were measured sequentially on the same sample. Transfection experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated twice.The tissue expression patterns of orange-spotted grouper kiss2 and kiss1ra mRNA in various tissues were analyzed by real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated from 17 tissues, including olfactory bulbs, telencephalon, optic tectum-thalamus, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, hypothalamus, pituitary, stomach, intestine, liver, spleen, kidney, ovary, adipose tissue, heart, gill, and muscle (n = 3). The discrete grouper brain areas dissected was based on our previous study [29].Potential sex differences for kiss2 and kiss1ra expression in hypothalamus were detected by real-time PCR using natural males (n = 3) with the majority of spermatids in the gonad and females (n = 3) with gonads at the previtellogenic stage.Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on a Roche LightCycler 480 real-time PCR system using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94°C for 15 sec, 55°C for 15 sec, and 72°C for 60 sec. Standard curves of amplification for the kiss2, kiss1ra, and 18s rRNA genes were generated using serial dilutions of plasmid constructs as templates. After amplification, fluorescent data were converted to threshold cycle values (CT). The concentration of template in the sample was determined by relating the CT value to the standard curve. Grouper kiss2 and kiss1ra transcript levels were normalized against 18s transcripts levels. The efficiency of primers for kiss2 was 1.810, and those for kiss1ra and 18s were 1.861 and 1.997, respectively.To evaluate the functional role of kiss2 in the hypothalamus-pituitary axis, female orange-spotted groupers were injected with Kiss2-10. The mRNA expression of gnrh1 and gnrh3 in hypothalamus and fshb and lhb in pituitary was analyzed by real-time PCR. Three-year-old female fish were anesthetized by immersing in a 0.01% solution of MS222 and injected i.p. with Kiss2-10 (2 nmol/g body weight at a volume of 20 μl/g body weight) or saline (20 μl/g body weight) as the sham control. Five fish from each group were collected randomly and killed by decapitation at 6 and 12 h postinjection. The hypothalami and pituitaries were quickly dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for subsequent RNA extraction. Real-time PCR was performed as described previously. Primers for grouper gnrh1, gnrh3, lhb, fshb, and 18s RNAs are presented in Table 1. The efficiency of primers for gnrh1 was 1.954, for gnrh3 was 1.951, for lhb was 1.847, and for fshb was 1.841. Three subtypes of gnrh in orange-spotted grouper have been cloned and clearly distinguished in our laboratory, but gnrh2 was not detected in grouper hypothalamus, and there was no cross-reactivity detected between primers of gnrh1 and gnrh3.MT (Sigma-Aldrich) was incorporated into silastic plus a curing agent (MDX4–4210; Dow Corning). The mixture was poured into a special mold (1.5 × 1.5 × 30-mm groove−1) and incubated overnight at room temperature to dry out. For the silastic pellets of sham controls, the same procedure was followed without addition of MT. Three-year-old female fish were divided into two groups: sham (n = 25) or MT implantation (n = 20). Fish were anesthetized with MS222 before implanting and sampling. The silastic pellets, which contain MT, were implanted with forceps into the peritoneal cavity of 20 groupers through an incision (2–4 mm) cut in the body wall. Sham controls received a blank silastic pellet. The two groups were kept in separate cages throughout the experiment. Five fish were anesthetized and killed by decapitation, and hypothalami were quickly dissected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C for subsequent RNA extraction before implantation (Week 0) and once a week after implantation for 4 wk. Body length and body weight were recorded. A piece of the central part of the gonad was fixed in Bouin fluid in order to confirm the sex reversal stage. The expression levels of kiss2, kiss1ra, gnrh1, and gnrh3 in the hypothalamus were detected by real-time PCR, which was performed as described previously.In order to test the effects of MT on hypothalamic kiss2 and kiss1ra expression in male fish, a second implantation of MT was also conducted for 1 wk into fish (n = 5) at the third week of the first MT implantation, which exhibited male gonadal histology with spermatids present in the testis (see Fig. 6G). Hypothalamic samples were collected and analyzed by real-time PCR.A, B, D, F, and H) Histology of gonads in control orange-spotted grouper. C, E, G, and I) Histology of gonads after MT implantation.

Bars = 50 μm.After fixation in Bouin fluid for 24 h, gonad tissues were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin for histology. The gonad tissues were serially sectioned at 7 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The classification of the sex reversal stage was determined under light microscopy (see Fig. 6).Quantitative data were expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical differences were estimated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Duncan multiple range tests in Figure 3, two-way ANOVA following posttests was used in Figures 5 and 7. A probability level less than 0.05 was used to indicate significance. All statistics were performed using SPSS 13.0 (SPSS). The EC50 values were determined using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software) from dose-response curves by means of computerized nonlinear curve fitting.A full-length cDNA encoding the kiss2 precursor was isolated from orange-spotted grouper hypothalamus, and the cDNA sequence has been deposited in GenBank (accession number GQ258777). As shown in Figure 1, the cDNA encoding grouper kiss2 is 619 base pairs (bp), containing an open reading frame of 378 bp, 84 bp of 5′ UTR and 157 bp of 3′ UTR. The Kiss2 precursor protein has 126 amino acids (aa), with an N-terminal putative signal peptide sequence of 18 aa and a cleavage site (GKP) at the 15th aa. Sequence comparison of deduced protein sequences showed that grouper and vertebrate KISS precursor proteins are poorly conserved. However, the mature peptide (KISS-10) and the C-terminal cleavage site (GKR or GRR) are conserved (Fig. 1B). Phylogenetic analysis showed that KISS cDNA sequences are clustered into two separate clades: kiss1 and kiss2. The grouper kiss is clustered with the kiss2 clade and shares the highest similarity with seabass kiss2 (Fig. 1C).cDNA and deduced amino acid sequence of orange-spotted grouper kiss2.

The deduced 379 amino acids contain three potential N-linked glycosylation sites, seven transmembrane domains, and a cytoplasmic C-terminus (Fig. 2A).

The activation of adenylate cyclase/protein kinase A and phospholipase C/PRKC signaling pathways can be measured by the CRE-luc and SRE-luc reporter systems, respectively. To further characterize ligand-receptor interactions of Kiss2-10 and Kiss1ra, CRE and SRE reporter gene assays were performed in COS-7 cells transfected with empty vector (control) or vectors carrying kiss1ra or Kiss1r cDNAs. Empty vector control cells exhibited no response to KISS treatment (data not shown). In COS-7 cells transfected with kiss1ra or Kiss1r, Kiss2-10 and rat KISS-10 increased SRE promoter activity. In SRE promoter assays, both rat KISS-10 and grouper Kiss2-10 elicited a greater than 2-fold increase in response, while rat KISS-10 showed high potency in activating Kiss1r with a nearly 5-fold increase in response at concentrations of 10−6 M (EC50 = 0.1823 and 0.3714 μM, respectively; Fig. 3A). Both rat KISS-10 and Kiss2-10 were found to have similar potencies in activating kiss1ra (EC50 = 0.3627 and 0.4381 μM, respectively; Fig. 3B). However, neither Kiss2-10 nor rat KISS-10 was effective in stimulating the CRE pathway in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with either Kiss1r or kiss1ra (Fig. 3, C and D). To confirm that the CRE promoter is functional, we treated the kiss1r-transfected cells with goldfish Kiss-10 and found that it induced CRE promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Supplemental Figure S1, available at www.biolreprod.org).Kiss2-10-induced reporter activity. A and B) Graded concentrations (from 10−10 to 10−6 M) of rat KISS-10 and grouper Kiss2-10 induce SRE-driven luciferase in COS-7 cells transfected with rat Kiss1r and grouper kiss1ra, respectively.

Both kiss2 and kiss1ra mRNAs were expressed in all tissues examined. Within the brain, the highest levels of kiss2 and kiss1ra mRNAs were detected in olfactory bulb, while the hypothalamus exhibited moderate levels of kiss2 and kiss1ra mRNAs. In peripheral tissues, the highest mRNA levels of kiss2 and kiss1ra were found in the ovary (Fig. 4A). The expression of hypothalamic kiss2 was higher in female than in male, whereas no significant differences in hypothalamic kiss1ra transcript levels were detected between two sexes (Fig. 4B).Tissue distribution of kiss2 and kiss1ra in the orange-spotted grouper. A) Expression of kiss2 and kiss1ra mRNA in various tissues of orange-spotted grouper. The mRNA levels were quantified by real-time RT-PCR in 1) olfactory bulb, 2) telencephalon, 3) optic tectum-thalamus, 4) cerebellum, 5) medulla oblongata, 6) hypothalamus, 7) pituitary, 8) stomach, 9) intestine, 10) liver, 11) spleen, 12) kidney, 13) ovary, 14) adipose tissue, 15) heart, 16) gill, and 17) muscle. The results are normalized to 18S RNA. B) The mRNA levels of kiss2 and kiss1ra in hypothalamus of natural female and male orange-spotted grouper. 18s is used as the reference gene. The results are expressed as fold change. Each bar represents the mean ± SEM of three samples. *P < 0.05.Intraperitoneal injection of Kiss2-10 significantly increased gnrh1 mRNA levels in the hypothalamus at 6 and 12 h postinjection; however, no significant difference was found in gnrh3 mRNA levels (Fig. 5). A significant increase in fshb mRNA levels in pituitary at 6 h postinjection was observed, whereas no significant difference at 12 h postinjection was found (Fig. 5). There was no significant effect of Kiss2-10 on lhb mRNA levels at either 6 or 12 h postinjection (Fig. 5).Effects of Kiss2-10 (2 nmol/g wet weight delivered i.p.) on gene expression for gnrh1, gnrh3, lhb, and fshb at 6 and 12 h postinjection in sexually mature female orange-spotted grouper. 18s is used as the reference gene. The results are presented as mean ± SEM of three to five samples and expressed as fold change in relative mRNA expression from sham-injected controls (Sham). *P < 0.05 vs. sham controls (n = 5).The changes in gonadal histology of 3-yr-old orange-spotted groupers after MT implantation are shown in Figure 6. Ovaries before treatment had oocytes at the previtellogenic stage (Week 0; Fig. 6A), and the sham-implanted group remained at the same stage throughout the experiment (Fig. 6, B, D, F, and H). In contrast, gonads exhibiting intersex transition were observed in the MT-implanted groups. Gonads at the early transitional phase were characterized by degeneration of oocytes and simultaneous proliferation of spermatogenic cysts (Week 1; Fig. 6C). As degeneration progressed, atretic oocytes were absorbed, and spermatogenic cysts proliferated (Week 2; Fig. 6E). Gonads at the late transitional phase were characterized by various phases of spermatogenic cysts from spermatocytes to spermatids (Week 2; Fig. 6E). Gonads at the developing male stage were characterized by a majority of spermatids (Week 3; Fig. 6G). The orange-spotted grouper became functionally male in the fourth week after MT implantation with spermatozoa released into sperm sinuses (Fig. 6I).In the first week after MT implantation, transcript levels of kiss2 and kiss1ra in the hypothalamus were reduced significantly, and kiss2 levels remained low in the second and third weeks. However, transcript levels of kiss1ra returned to the same level as controls from the second to the fourth week. In the fourth week, the expression of kiss2 in MT-treated fish increased significantly to more than 2-fold higher than controls (Fig. 7, A and B). Grouper gnrh1 exhibited similar expression patterns to those of kiss2 with more than an 8-fold increase at the fourth week in the hypothalamus during sex reversal (Fig. 7C). However, mRNA levels of gnrh1 showed no significant changes during sex reversal (Fig. 7D).Levels of mRNA expression for kiss2 (A), kiss1ra (B), gnrh1 (C), and gnrh3 (D) in hypothalamus of orange-spotted grouper after MT implantation. 18s is used as the reference gene.

Values without common notation (a, b, c) differ significantly (P < 0.05).A second implantation of MT for 1 wk in MT-induced male fish at the third week (Fig. 6G) enhanced mRNA expression of kiss2 significantly, whereas no obvious changes were found in kiss1ra expression (Fig. 8).The mRNA levels of kiss2 and kiss1ra in hypothalamus of male orange-spotted grouper after MT implantation. 18s is used as the reference gene. Each bar represents the mean ± SEM of three to five samples. The results are normalized to 18S. *P < 0.05.In this study, we have cloned full-length cDNAs encoding kiss2 and kiss1ra in a protogynous hermaphrodite fish species. The deduced amino acid sequence of kiss2 is poorly conserved with other vertebrate KISS1 orthologs, except for the core conserved putative mature peptide (KISS-10) and the GKR cleavage site, suggesting that KISS-10 is the most important functional part of the KISS1 protein. The predicted amino acid sequence of kiss1ra is highly conserved with other teleost fish and even some mammals, such as human [31], mouse [32], and rat [33], with three putative glycosylation sites at its N-terminus.Multiple forms of kiss1 and kiss1r cDNAs have been cloned from a variety of vertebrate species, including fish, amphibians, and monotremes [22]. Duplication of the ancestral kiss1 and kiss1r genes took place early in vertebrate evolution, giving rise to the kiss1, kiss2, kiss1ra, and kiss1rb genes. Gene loss has also occurred because the kiss2 gene is not found in higher mammalian species such as rodents or primates, and only kiss2 and one type of kiss1r are present in Takifugu rubripes (fugu) and Tetraodon nigroviridis (pufferfish) [22]. The gene presence can be described based on the theory of duplication-degeneration-complementation [34]. In this study, only one type of grouper kiss or kiss1r was identified. Phylogenetic analysis showed that grouper kiss clusters in the kiss2 clade, and grouper kiss1r is more closely related to kiss1r sequences previously identified from tilapia and cobia, which belong to the kiss1ra subfamily [22].Several studies have identified the functional region of KISS, KISS-10, which transduces intracellular signaling mechanisms through KISS1R via the protein kinase C and protein kinase A pathways [19, 20, 30]. In this study, Kiss2-10 induced a concentration-dependent increase in SRE-luc activity and showed no potency in stimulating the CRE pathway, which provides solid evidence that grouper Kiss2-10 activates intracellular signaling via Kiss1ra. The results are similar to previous reports for zebrafish and bullfrog [20, 30]. In some fish species, such as goldfish [19] and zebrafish [20], which have two types of Kiss1 and Kiss1r, there are ligand-receptor cross interactions and distinct differences in ligand selectivity.High expression levels of kiss2 and kiss1ra mRNA were observed in the brain and gonads, similar to zebrafish, medaka, goldfish, and sea bass [17–20], which strongly suggests roles for kiss2 and kiss1ra in the control of grouper reproduction. In brain areas, moderate expression levels of kiss2 and kiss1ra in the hypothalamus were observed, which are fully consistent with their putative roles in the regulation of GnRH neuronal activity. Both kiss2 and kiss1ra mRNA were detected in grouper ovary and testis, as reported for human and sea bass [1, 18]. In addition, kiss2 and kiss1ra transcripts were also detected in other peripheral tissues, suggesting that these genes may play additional functional roles besides controlling reproduction [35], but their physiological significance remains unclear.Tissue distribution analysis showed that hypothalamic kiss2 mRNA levels in natural males were significantly lower than in females. A similar difference was also found between the reversed males at the third week after MT implantation and the sham-implanted females. However, hypothalamic kiss2 transcripts were significantly higher in reversed males at the fourth week after MT implantation than that in sham females. This seemingly contradictory result might be due to the different gonadal stages among the male fish analyzed.Kiss2-10 injection significantly enhanced expression of gnrh1 in the hypothalamus in this study. Although most studies have demonstrated a stimulatory role for KISS1 on GnRH release, KISS-10 (1–10 nM) can significantly stimulate Gnrh mRNA expression in GT1–7 cells [36]. A direct effect of grouper Kiss2-10 on gnrh1 is consistent with the situation in mammals where KISS1 regulates Gnrh1 (mammalian gnrh). In contrast to the situation in mammals, human KISS1 can stimulate gnrh3 expression in early to midpubertal fathead minnows, which is in fact regarded as the major gnrh isoform associated with reproduction [37]. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that in grouper GnRH1-ir, cell bodies located in the preoptic area project fibers almost exclusively to the pituitary (Liu, unpublished data), suggesting that gnrh1 is the best candidate gnrh to participate in gonadal maturation by stimulating GtH secretion [38, 39]. On the other hand, Kiss2-10 injection also simulated significantly the expression of fshb in the pituitary; however, no significant changes in lhb mRNA levels were observed. It is well known that FSH stimulates follicular growth while LH is essential for the final stages of follicular maturation [40]. In the sexually mature female zebrafish, a highly significant increase in lhb mRNA levels (approximately 8-fold, P < 0.01) and a significant increase in fshb mRNA levels (approximately 2.7-fold, P < 0.05) were found after Kiss2 decapeptide injection [21]. This may be due to the fact that the groupers used in the study were at previtellogenic stages. It is also possible that Kiss2-10 regulates fshb synthesis directly at the level of the pituitary. This possibility requires further investigation.The most significant changes observed during the MT-induced sex reversal process were inhibition of kiss2, kiss1ra, and gnrh1 mRNA expression in the first week and stimulation in the fourth week when the fish became functionally male. On the other hand, when we treated the reversed male fish with MT for 1 wk, transcript levels of kiss2 also increased significantly. Taken together, these results indicate that the increase in kiss2 expression in the fourth week after MT implantation is caused not by loss of systemic MT but by a phenotypic switch in kiss2 responsiveness to MT associated with sex reversal. Thus, MT might stimulate kiss2 in males but suppress it in females. The changes in kiss2 expression in the hypothalamus during sex reversal might be caused by a direct effect of MT on hypothalamic Kiss2 neurons or by an indirect effect of gonadal steroid feedback regulation.The inhibition of kiss2, kiss1ra, and gnrh1 mRNA expression in the first week agree well with previous studies showing significantly decreased expression of fshb after MT treatment in the orange-spotted grouper [25]. It has been well documented that FSH is the major stimulator of ovarian aromatase expression and an activity leading to production of E2 from vitellogenic follicles [41–43]. In protogynous sequential hermaphrodite sex reversal, oocyte atresia was found to be the first histological indicator of sex reversal, followed by development of spermatogenic tissue [44, 45]. We have shown that kiss2 is a potent activator of fshb synthesis in the female grouper; therefore, the inhibition of kiss2 and gnrh1 expression that is likely accompanied by a decrease in fshb expression might be associated with ovarian degeneration. When orange-spotted groupers underwent a sex reversal to become mature males, the transcript levels of both kiss2 and gnrh1 in the hypothalamus increased significantly. Similar changes in the GnRH system have previously been reported in a female-to-male sex-changing labrid fish, the bluehead wrasse [27]. In protandrous hermaphroditic dusky anemonefish (Amphiprion melanopus), the number of preoptic GnRH-immunoreactive cells is greater in the male phase, which might be associated with proliferation and/or maintenance of spermatogenic tissue [26]. We propose that the higher expression levels of kiss2 and gnrh1 in the reversed mature male fish may play similar roles in the maintenance of male function. Thus, our findings suggest that the Kiss2/Kiss1ra system, together with the hypothalamic-hypophysial axis, may be involved in the sex reversal process in grouper.We thank Mr. Zhou Hanlin and Dr. Zhang Haifa for their valuable assistance in rearing the fish and Chen Huapu, Sang Qing, and Chai Ke for assistance in collecting samples.

Learn about our remote access optionsSOX3 has been suggested to play significant roles in gametogenesis and gonad differentiation of vertebrates, but the exact cellular localization evidence is insufficient and controversial. In this study, a protogynous hermaphrodite fish Epinephelus coioides is selected to analyze EcSox3 differential expression and the expression pattern in both processes of oogenesis and spermatogenesis by utilizing the advantages that gonad development undergoes transition from ovary to intersexual gonad and then to testis, and primordial germ cells and different stage cells during oogenesis and spermatogenesis are synchronously observed in the transitional gonads. The detailed and clear immunofluoresence localization indicates that significantly differential expression and dynamic changes of Sox3 occur in the progresses of gametogenesis and sex reversal, and EcSOX3 protein exists in the differentiating primordial germ cells, oogonia, and different stage oocytes of ovaries, and also in the differentiating primordial germ cells and the Sertoli cells of testis. One important finding is that the EcSox3 expression is a significant time point for enterable gametogenesis of primordial germ cells because EcSOX3 is obviously expressed and localized in primordial germ cells. As EcSox3 continues to express, the EcSOX3‐positive primordial germ cells develop toward oogonia and then oocytes, whereas when EcSox3 expression is ceased, the EcSOX3‐positive primordial germ cells develop toward spermatogonia. Therefore, the current finding of EcSOX3 in the differentiating primordial germ cells again confirms the potential regulatory role in oogenesis and germ cell differentiation. The data further suggest that SOX3, as a transcription factor, might have more important roles in oogenesis than in spermatogenesis. J. Exp.

The groupers, since their gonads first develop as ovary and then reverse into testis, have been thought as good models to study sex differentiation and determination. In this study, we cloned the full-length cDNAs of DMRT1 gene from orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides), and prepared corresponding anti-EcDMRT1 antiserum to study the relationship of DMRT1 to sex reversal. One important finding is that the grouper DMRT1 is not only differentially expressed in different stage gonads, but also restricted to specific stages and specific cells of spermatogenesis. Grouper DMRT1 protein exists only in spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes and secondary spermatocytes, but not in the supporting Sertoli cells. Moreover, we confirmed that EcSox3 is expressed not only in oogonia and different stage oocytes, but also in Sertoli cells and spermatogonia, and EcSox9 is expressed only in Sertoli cells. The data suggested that grouper DMRT1 might be a more specific sex differentiation gene for spermatogenesis, and play its role at the specific stages from spermatogonia to spermatocytes. In addition, no introns were found in the grouper DMRT1, and no duplicated DMRT1 genes were detected. The finding implicates that the intronless DMRT1 that is able to undergo rapid transcriptional turnover might be a significant gene for stimulating spermatogenesis in the protogynous hermaphroditic gonad.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

In this study, a novel cDNA has been screened from a subtractive cDNA library between tail bud embryos and blastula embryos in the protogynous hermaphrodite orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides). Its full-length cDNA is 821 bp, and has an ORF of 414 bp for encoding a peptide of 137 aa, which shows 38%, 37%, 33%, and 33% homology with 4 putative proteins screened from zebrafish (Danio rerio). Conserved domain search in NCBI reveals a single C2 domain existing in the C2 domain superfamily proteins, and has only 7 β strands in comparison with 8 β strands of C2 domains in other C2 domain superfamily proteins. Artificial sex reversal, RT-PCR analysis and Western blot detection demonstrated ovary-specific expression of the C2 domain factor, and therefore the novel gene was designated as E. coioides ovary-specific C2 domain factor, EcOC2 factor. Moreover, predominant expression of EcOC2 factor was further revealed in grouper mature ovary, and its strong immunofluorescence signals were located between granulosa cells and oocyte zona radiata in grouper mature follicles. The data indicate that the novel EcOC2 factor might be a main component that associates between granulosa cells and the oocyte during oocyte maturation, and might play significant roles in regulating oocyte maturation and ovulation. Further studies on its developmental behaviour and physiological functions will elucidate the interactions between oocyte and the surrounding somatic cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

It contains 913 nucleotides with an open reading frame encoding 146 amino acids with a 20 amino acid signal peptide. The grouper mature TSHβ has 75, 70, 61, 59, 41, 42 and 40% identities to that of rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon, zebrafish, European eel, chicken, mouse and human, respectively. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the TSHβ mRNA was expressed abundantly not only in pituitary but also in gonads. A more interesting finding is to reveal the differential TSHβ expressions between the ovaries and the transitional gonads or testes in natural individuals of orange-spotted grouper and red-spotted grouper Epinephelus akaara, and in artificial sex reversal individuals of red-spotted grouper induced by MT feeding. In situ hybridization localization provided direct evidence that the TSHβ was transcribed in the germ cells. In the growing oocytes, the TSHβ transcripts were concentrated on the ooplasm periphery. In testicular tissues, the intensively expressed TSHβ cells were found to be spermatogonia and spermatocytes in the spermatogenic cysts. This is the first report of a TSHβ expressed in the gonads of any vertebrates in addition to the expected expression in the pituitary, and it expresses more transcripts in the gonads during sex reversal or testis than in the ovaries both in E. coioides and E. akaara. Importantly, the TSHβ identification in germ cells allows us to further investigate the functional roles and the molecular mechanisms in gametogenesis of groupers, especially in sex reversal and in spermatogenesis.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.
