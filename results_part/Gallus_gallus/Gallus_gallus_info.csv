32990306,CYP19A1 (aromatase) dominates female gonadal differentiation in chicken (Gallus gallus) embryos sexual differentiation.,"Jin K, Zuo Q, Song J, Zhang Y, Chen G, Li B",Biosci Rep. 2020 Oct 30;40(10). pii: 226544. doi: 10.1042/BSR20201576.,"Cytochrome P450 Family 19 SubFamily A member 1 (CYP19A1) gene encodes an aromatase which regulates the sexual differentiation in vertebrates by initiating and maintaining 17beta-Estradiol (E2) synthesis. Here, we described the spatiotemporal expression pattern of CYP19A1 and its functional role in the embryonic gonad development in amphoteric chickens (Gallus gallus). Results showed that CYP19A1 exhibited a sexually dimorphic expression pattern in female gonads early at embryonic day 5.5 (HH 28) and robustly expressed within the cytoplasm in ovarian medullas. Most importantly, we induced the gonadal sex reversal by ectopically delivering the aromatase inhibitor (AI) or estradiol (E2) into chicken embryos. To further explore the role of CYP19A1 in chicken embryonic sexual differentiation, we successfully developed an effective method to deliver lentiviral particles with CYP19A1 manipulation into chicken embryos via embryonic intravascular injection. The analysis of interference and overexpression of CYP19A1 provided solid evidences that CYP19A1 is both necessary and sufficient to initiate sex differentiation toward female in chicken embryos. Collectively, this work demonstrates that CYP19A1 is a crucial sex differentiation gene in the embryonic development, which provides a foundation for understanding the mechanism of sex determination and differentiation in chickens."
32194632,Beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Genes in Orange-Spotted Grouper (Epinephelus coioides): Genome-Wide Identification and Expression Analysis During Sex Reversal.,"Xiao L, Guo Y, Wang D, Zhao M, Hou X, Li S, Lin H, Zhang Y",Front Genet. 2020 Mar 4;11:161. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2020.00161. eCollection 2020.,"Beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (beta-HSDs) are a group of steroidogenic enzymes that are involved in steroid biosynthesis and metabolism, and play a crucial role in mammalian physiology and development, including sex determination and differentiation. In the present study, a genome-wide analysis identified the numbers of beta-hsd genes in orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) (19), human (Homo sapiens) (22), mouse (Mus musculus) (24), chicken (Gallus gallus) (16), xenopus (Xenopus tropicalis) (24), coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) (17), spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) (14), zebrafish (Danio rerio) (19), fugu (Takifugu rubripes) (19), tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) (19), medaka (Oryzias latipes) (19), stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) (17) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) (27) samples. A comparative analysis revealed that the number of beta-hsd genes in teleost fish was no greater than in tetrapods due to gene loss followed by a teleost-specific whole-genome duplication event. Based on transcriptome data from grouper brain and gonad samples during sex reversal, six beta-hsd genes had relatively high expression levels in the brain, indicating that these genes may be required for neurogenesis or the maintenance of specific biological processes in the brain. In the gonad, two and eight beta-hsd genes were up- and downregulated, respectively, indicating their important roles in sex reversal. Our results demonstrated that beta-hsd genes may be involved in the sex reversal of grouper by regulating the synthesis and metabolism of sex steroid hormones."

Epub 2020 Mar 11.,"In birds, the female is heterogametic (ZW) and the male homogametic (ZZ). The small W chromosome comprises only 28 protein coding genes (homologues to Z chromosome counterparts) and a number of repeat regions. Here, we report our analysis of one of these genes, BTF3 (basic transcription factor 3), which exhibits differential expression during gonadogenesis. We measured RNA levels of both Z and W homologues and BTF3 protein levels in male and female gonads during development of the chicken embryo. In addition, BTF3 RNA and protein levels were compared in female gonads (ovary) and in female gonads following treatment to induce sex reversal (testis). Combined BTF3 RNA levels were higher in female gonads than male gonads, while BTF3-Z was expressed at similar levels in males and females. Surprisingly, BTF3 protein levels were higher in male gonads than female gonads at embryonic day 6 (E6), suggesting translational rather than transcriptional regulation. BTF3 protein was expressed in both somatic and germ cells and was restricted to the medulla of the developing ovary in females and the sex cords of the developing testis in males. In addition, in gonadal sex-reversed females, RNA and protein levels of BTF3 were similar to those normally found in male gonads, suggesting that BTF3 expression correlated with the gonadal phenotype."
31063656,The rise and fall of differentiated sex chromosomes in geckos.,"Rovatsos M, Farkacova K, Altmanova M, Johnson Pokorna M, Kratochvil L",Mol Ecol. 2019 Jun;28(12):3042-3052. doi: 10.1111/mec.15126. Epub 2019 Jun 28.,"Amniotes possess variability in sex determination, ranging from environmental sex determination to genotypic sex determination with differentiated sex chromosomes. Differentiated sex chromosomes have emerged independently several times. Their noteworthy convergent characteristic is the evolutionary stability, documented among amniotes in mammals, birds, and some lineages of lizards, snakes and turtles. Combining the analysis of multiple partial transcriptomes with the comparison of copy gene numbers between male and female genomes, we uncovered partial gene content of the highly differentiated ZZ/ZW sex chromosomes in the gecko genus Paroedura. The differentiated ZZ/ZW sex chromosomes of these geckos share genes with the part of the chicken chromosome 4 homologous with the XX/XY sex chromosomes of viviparous mammals and the ZZ/ZW sex chromosomes of lacertid lizards, as well as with the chicken chromosome 15, homologous with the XX/XY sex chromosomes of iguanas and ZZ/ZW sex chromosomes of softshell turtles. Along with other analogous cases, this finding reinforces the observation that particular chromosomes are repeatedly coopted for the function of sex chromosomes in amniotes. Notably, according to the phylogenetic distribution, the subclade of the genus Paroedura represents a rare case of the reversal of the for a considerable evolutionary time highly differentiated ZZ/ZW sex chromosomes back to poorly differentiated state."
31022716,"Cotreatment of IGF1 and Fadrozole Upregulates the Expression of RSPO1, SOX9, and AMH in Chicken Embryos.","Rahaie A, Toghyani M, Eghbalsaied S",Cells Tissues Organs. 2018;206(4-5):218-228. doi: 10.1159/000499079. Epub 2019 Apr 25.,"Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) and anti-aromatase synergistically increase the rate and stability of female-to-male sex reversal as well as pre- and postnatal weight gains in hatched chickens. This study aimed at assessing gene expression profiles of chicken embryos treated with IGF1 and fadrozole. Day 3.5 fertile eggs were in ovo injected with one of IGF1, fadrozole anti-aromatase, combined IGF1 and fadrozole, or sham injection. The expression profile was studied on day 6 and day 11 of the embryonic development following gonadal differentiation. On day 6 of embryonic development, simultaneous injection of IGF1 and fadrozole significantly upregulated the expression of RSPO1, AMH, and SOX9 in genetically female embryos compared to single injections and control groups. Also, a higher expression of ESR1 and BMP4 was observed in genetically male embryos on day 6 compared to the control group. In day 11 embryos, a higher expression of BMP4 was detected in both males and females of the IGF1 and fadrozole-administered group compared to the sham injection cohort. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that combined effects of IGF1 and fadrozole induce female-to-male sex reversal by increasing the expression of testis developmental factors rather than attenuating ovary developmental factors."
30369707,The relationship between learning speed and personality is age- and task-dependent in red junglefowl.,"Zidar J, Balogh A, Favati A, Jensen P, Leimar O, Sorato E, Lovlie H",Behav Ecol Sociobiol. 2018;72(10):168. doi: 10.1007/s00265-018-2579-2. Epub 2018 Sep 26.,"Abstract: Cognition is fundamental to animals' lives and an important source of phenotypic variation. Nevertheless, research on individual variation in animal cognition is still limited. Further, although individual cognitive abilities have been suggested to be linked to personality (i.e., consistent behavioral differences among individuals), few studies have linked performance across multiple cognitive tasks to personality traits. Thus, the interplays between cognition and personality are still unclear. We therefore investigated the relationships between an important aspect of cognition, learning, and personality, by exposing young and adult red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) to multiple learning tasks (discriminative, reversal, and spatial learning) and personality assays (novel arena, novel object, and tonic immobility). Learning speed was not correlated across learning tasks, and learning speed in discrimination and spatial learning tasks did not co-vary with personality. However, learning speed in reversal tasks was associated with individual variation in exploration, and in an age-dependent manner. More explorative chicks learned the reversal task faster than less explorative ones, while the opposite association was found for adult females (learning speed could not be assayed in adult males). In the same reversal tasks, we also observed a sex difference in learning speed of chicks, with females learning faster than males. Our results suggest that the relationship between cognition and personality is complex, as shown by its task- and age-dependence, and encourage further investigation of the causality and dynamics of this relationship. Significance statement: In the ancestor of today's chickens, the red junglefowl, we explored how personality and cognition relate by exposing both chicks and adults to several learning tasks and personality assays. Our birds differed in personality and learning speed, while fast learners in one task did not necessarily learn fast in another (i.e., there were no overall ""smarter"" birds). Exploration correlated with learning speed in the more complex task of reversal learning: faster exploring chicks, but slower exploring adult females, learned faster, compared to less explorative birds. Other aspects of cognition and personality did not correlate. Our results suggest that cognition and personality are related, and that the relationship can differ depending on task and age of the animal."
29684809,Simultaneous effects of IGF1 and Fadrozole on parthenogenesis and pluripotency markers in chicken embryo.,"Hajihoseini Z, Eghbalsaied S",Theriogenology. 2018 Jul 1;114:317-323. doi: 10.1016/j.theriogenology.2018.04.009. Epub 2018 Apr 13.,"So far, a synergistic effect was detected between insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF1) and anti-aromatase for sex reversal and pre-/post-natal growth of fertilized chicken embryo. Here, we hypothesized whether the growth and sexual female-to-male reversal effects of IGF1 and an anti-aromatase, Fadrozole, could improve the development of unfertilized, parthenogenetic chicken embryos. Simultaneous administration of IGF1 and Fadrozole increased the percentage of grade A embryos from 1.7% (no injection group) to 70.6%. The expression profile of parthenotes and newly laid fertilized embryos showed that IGF1 and Fadrozole increased SOX2 and NANOG expression, while decreased the TBX3 expression in the parthenogenetic embryos. However, a considerably higher expression of PRDM16, IGF2, NODAL and HDAC2 was observed in the fertilized group compared to the parthenogenetic embryos. In conclusion, chicken sexual determination is initiated at the earliest stage of embryonic development before gonadal differentiation. Combined administration of IGF1 and Fadrozole increased the developmental rate of parthenogenetic embryos. Also, simultaneous supplementation of IGF1 and Fadrozole induced the expression of pluripotency genes with no effect on the expression of growth and differentiation factors."
29191790,Morphological and transcriptomic effects of endocrine modulators on the gonadal differentiation of chicken embryos: The case of tributyltin (TBT).,"Scheider J, Afonso-Grunz F, Jessl L, Hoffmeier K, Winter P, Oehlmann J",Toxicol Lett. 2018 Mar 1;284:143-151. doi: 10.1016/j.toxlet.2017.11.019. Epub 2017 Nov 27.,"Morphological malformations induced by tributyltin (TBT) exposure during embryonic development have already been characterized in various taxonomic groups, but, nonetheless, the molecular processes underlying these changes remain obscure. The present study provides the first genome-wide screening for differentially expressed genes that are linked to morphological alterations of gonadal tissue from chicken embryos after exposure to TBT. We applied a single injection of TBT (between 0.5 and 30pg as Sn/g egg) into incubated fertile eggs to simulate maternal transfer of the endocrine disruptive compound. Methyltestosterone (MT) served as a positive control (30pg/g egg). After 19days of incubation, structural features of the gonads as well as genome-wide gene expression profiles were assessed simultaneously. TBT induced significant morphological and histological malformations of gonadal tissue from female embryos that show a virilization of the ovaries. This phenotypical virilization was mirrored by altered expression profiles of sex-dependent genes. Among these are several transcription and growth factors (e.g. FGF12, CTCF, NFIB), whose altered expression might serve as a set of markers for early identification of endocrine active chemicals that affect embryonic development by transcriptome profiling without the need of elaborate histological analyses."
28980227,Sex-Determining Mechanism in Avians.,Kuroiwa A,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2017;1001:19-31. doi: 10.1007/978-981-10-3975-1_2.,"The sex of birds is determined by inheritance of sex chromosomes at fertilization. The embryo with two Z chromosomes (ZZ) develops into a male; by contrast, the embryo with Z and W chromosomes (ZW) becomes female. Two theories are hypothesized for the mechanisms of avian sex determination that explain how genes carried on sex chromosomes control gonadal differentiation and development during embryogenesis. One proposes that the dosage of genes on the Z chromosome determines the sexual differentiation of undifferentiated gonads, and the other proposes that W-linked genes dominantly determine ovary differentiation or inhibit testis differentiation. Z-linked DMRT1, which is a strong candidate avian sex-determining gene, supports the former hypothesis. Although no candidate W-linked gene has been identified, extensive evidence for spontaneous sex reversal in birds and aneuploid chimeric chickens with an abnormal sex chromosome constitution strongly supports the latter hypothesis. After the sex of gonad is determined by a gene(s) located on the sex chromosomes, gonadal differentiation is subsequently progressed by several genes. Developed gonads secrete sex hormones to masculinize or feminize the whole body of the embryo. In this section, the sex-determining mechanism as well as the genes and sex hormones mainly involved in gonadal differentiation and development of chicken are introduced."
28911174,Sex Reversal and Comparative Data Undermine the W Chromosome and Support Z-linked DMRT1 as the Regulator of Gonadal Sex Differentiation in Birds.,"Hirst CE, Major AT, Ayers KL, Brown RJ, Mariette M, Sackton TB, Smith CA",Endocrinology. 2017 Sep 1;158(9):2970-2987. doi: 10.1210/en.2017-00316.,"The exact genetic mechanism regulating avian gonadal sex differentiation has not been completely resolved. The most likely scenario involves a dosage mechanism, whereby the Z-linked DMRT1 gene triggers testis development. However, the possibility still exists that the female-specific W chromosome may harbor an ovarian determining factor. In this study, we provide evidence that the universal gene regulating gonadal sex differentiation in birds is Z-linked DMRT1 and not a W-linked (ovarian) factor. Three candidate W-linked ovarian determinants are HINTW, female-expressed transcript 1 (FET1), and female-associated factor (FAF). To test the association of these genes with ovarian differentiation in the chicken, we examined their expression following experimentally induced female-to-male sex reversal using the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole (FAD). Administration of FAD on day 3 of embryogenesis induced a significant loss of aromatase enzyme activity in female gonads and masculinization. However, expression levels of HINTW, FAF, and FET1 were unaltered after experimental masculinization. Furthermore, comparative analysis showed that FAF and FET1 expression could not be detected in zebra finch gonads. Additionally, an antibody raised against the predicted HINTW protein failed to detect it endogenously. These data do not support a universal role for these genes or for the W sex chromosome in ovarian development in birds. We found that DMRT1 (but not the recently identified Z-linked HEMGN gene) is male upregulated in embryonic zebra finch and emu gonads, as in the chicken. As chicken, zebra finch, and emu exemplify the major evolutionary clades of birds, we propose that Z-linked DMRT1, and not the W sex chromosome, regulates gonadal sex differentiation in birds."
27793086,Sex-linked markers in the North American green frog (Rana clamitans) developed using DArTseq provide early insight into sex chromosome evolution.,"Lambert MR, Skelly DK, Ezaz T",BMC Genomics. 2016 Oct 28;17(1):844. doi: 10.1186/s12864-016-3209-x.,"BACKGROUND: The extent to which sex reversal is associated with transitions in sex determining systems (XX-XY, ZZ-ZW, etc.) or abnormal sexual differentiation is predominantly unexplored in amphibians. This is in large part because most amphibian taxa have homomorphic sex chromosomes, which has traditionally made it challenging to identify discordance between phenotypic and genetic sex in amphibians, despite all amphibians having a genetic component to sex determination. Recent advances in molecular techniques such as genome complexity reduction and high throughput sequencing present a valuable avenue for furthering our understanding of sex determination in amphibians and other taxa with homomorphic sex chromosomes like many fish and reptiles. RESULTS: We use DArTseq as a novel approach to identify sex-linked markers in the North American green frog (Rana clamitans melanota) using lab-reared tadpoles as well as wild-caught adults from seven ponds either in undeveloped, forested habitats or suburban ponds known to be subject to contamination by anthropogenic chemicals. The DArTseq methodology identified 13 sex-linked SNP loci and eight presence-absence loci associated with males, indicating an XX-XY system. Both alleles from a single locus show partial high sequence homology to Dmrt1, a gene linked to sex determination and differentiation throughout Metazoa. Two other loci have sequence similarities to regions of the chimpanzee and human X-chromosome as well as the chicken Z-chromosome. Several loci also show geographic variation in sex-linkage, possibly indicating sex chromosome recombination. While all loci are statistically sex-linked, they show varying degrees of female heterozygosity and male homozygosity, providing further evidence that some markers are on regions of the sex chromosomes undergoing higher rates of recombination and therefore further apart from the putative sex determining locus. CONCLUSION: The ease of the DArTseq platform provides a useful avenue for future research on sex reversal and sex chromosome evolution in vertebrates, particularly for non-model species with homomorphic or cryptic or nascent sex chromosomes."
27562942,A Window of MHM Demethylation Correlates with Key Events in Gonadal Differentiation in the Chicken.,"Yang X, Deng J, Zheng J, Xia L, Yang Z, Qu L, Chen S, Xu G, Jiang H, Clinton M, Yang N",Sex Dev. 2016;10(3):152-8. doi: 10.1159/000447659. Epub 2016 Aug 26.,"The MHM (male hypermethylated) region on the chicken Z chromosome is of interest in terms of sex determination both because hypermethylation of the promoter in males results in female-specific expression, and in females the non-coding transcripts accumulate in the region of a locus that encodes a key candidate gene for testis differentiation in birds - DMRT1. However, it has yet to be established whether MHM plays a role in either sex determination or gonadal development in chicken. Here, we sought to establish the MHM methylation pattern during chicken gonadal development and determine how this pattern correlates with the expression profiles of genes involved in sex determination and gonadal differentiation. As expected, we found that MHM methylation levels were higher in male than in female gonads at most stages of development. We also showed that there was no significant difference in the methylation patterns between the right and left gonad and that the pattern of methylation in female gonads was not affected by sex reversal. However, we did find an unexpected window where MHM promoter methylation levels were very low in both males and females. This developmental window coincided with a stage of gonad development where there is a dramatic increase in expression of key testis genes in males and of key ovary genes in females. The current study raises the possibility that the non-coding RNA transcripts of MHM may affect testis and ovary differentiation by influencing sex-specific gene expression."

Epub 2015 Nov 10.,"Estrogens play a key role in sexual differentiation of both the gonads and external traits in birds. The production of estrogen occurs via a well-characterized steroidogenic pathway, which is a multistep process involving several enzymes, including cytochrome P450 aromatase. In chicken embryos, the aromatase gene (CYP19A1) is expressed female-specifically from the time of gonadal sex differentiation. Ectopic overexpression of aromatase in male chicken embryos induces gonadal sex reversal, and male embryos treated with estradiol become feminized; however, this is not permanent. To test whether a continuous supply of estrogen in adult chickens could induce stable male to female sex reversal, 2 transgenic male chickens overexpressing aromatase were generated using the Tol2/transposase system. These birds had robust ectopic aromatase expression, which resulted in the production of high serum levels of estradiol. Transgenic males had female-like wattle and comb growth and feathering, but they retained male weights, displayed leg spurs, and developed testes. Despite the small sample size, this data strongly suggests that high levels of circulating estrogen are insufficient to maintain a female gonadal phenotype in adult birds. Previous observations of gynandromorph birds and embryos with mixed sex chimeric gonads have highlighted the role of cell autonomous sex identity in chickens. This might imply that in the study described here, direct genetic effects of the male chromosomes largely prevailed over the hormonal profile of the aromatase transgenic birds. This data therefore support the emerging view of at least partial cell autonomous sex development in birds. However, a larger study will confirm this intriguing observation."
26377738,Identification of candidate gonadal sex differentiation genes in the chicken embryo using RNA-seq.,"Ayers KL, Lambeth LS, Davidson NM, Sinclair AH, Oshlack A, Smith CA",BMC Genomics. 2015 Sep 16;16:704. doi: 10.1186/s12864-015-1886-5.,"BACKGROUND: Despite some advances in recent years, the genetic control of gonadal sex differentiation during embryogenesis is still not completely understood. To identify new candidate genes involved in ovary and testis development, RNA-seq was used to define the transcriptome of embryonic chicken gonads at the onset of sexual differentiation (day 6.0/stage 29). RESULTS: RNA-seq revealed more than 1000 genes that were transcribed in a sex-biased manner at this early stage of gonadal differentiation. Comparison with undifferentiated gonads revealed that sex biased expression was derived primarily from autosomal rather than sex-linked genes. Gene ontology and pathway analysis indicated that many of these genes encoded proteins involved in extracellular matrix function and cytoskeletal remodelling, as well as tubulogenesis. Several of these genes are novel candidate regulators of gonadal sex differentiation, based on sex-biased expression profiles that are altered following experimental sex reversal. We further characterised three female-biased (ovarian) genes; calpain-5 (CAPN5), G-protein coupled receptor 56 (GPR56), and FGFR3 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3). Protein expression of these candidates in the developing ovaries suggests that they play an important role in this tissue. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into the earliest steps of vertebrate gonad sex differentiation, and identifies novel candidate genes for ovarian and testicular development."

Epub 2015 Jan 30.,"We have identified differences in gene expression in macrophages grown from the bone marrow of male and female chickens in recombinant chicken M-CSF (CSF1). Cells were profiled with or without treatment with bacterial LPS for 24 h. Approximately 600 transcripts were induced by prolonged LPS stimulation to an equal extent in the male and female macrophages. Many transcripts encoded on the Z chromosome were expressed approximately 1.6-fold higher in males, reflecting a lack of dosage compensation in the homogametic sex. A smaller set of W chromosome-specific genes was expressed only in females. LPS signaling in mammals is associated with induction of type 1 IFN-responsive genes. Unexpectedly, because IFNs are encoded on the Z chromosome of chickens, unstimulated macrophages from the female birds expressed a set of known IFN-inducible genes at much higher levels than male cells under the same conditions. To confirm that these differences were not the consequence of the actions of gonadal hormones, we induced gonadal sex reversal to alter the hormonal environment of the developing chick and analyzed macrophages cultured from male, female, and female sex-reversed embryos. Gonadal sex reversal did not alter the sexually dimorphic expression of either sex-linked or IFN-responsive genes. We suggest that female birds compensate for the reduced dose of inducible IFN with a higher basal set point of IFN-responsive genes."

Epub 2015 Jan 5.,"Hormonal regulation of pituitary gonadotropin gene expression has been attributed to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-mediated stimulation of immediate early gene expression and gonadal steroid interactions with their respective nuclear receptors. A number of orphan nuclear receptors including steroidogenic factor 1, liver receptor homologue 1, dosage-sensitive sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia critical region, on chromosome X, gene 1, and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors I/II as well as the GATA family members, GATA2 and GATA4, have also been implicated in transcriptional regulation of the gonadotropin genes. We hypothesized that hormonally mediated changes in these latter transcription factors may provide an additional mechanism for mediating hormonal effects beyond the more classically appreciated pathways. In these studies, we demonstrate significant regulation of orphan nuclear receptor and GATA messenger RNA levels by GnRH, dihydrotestosterone, estradiol, and progesterone in both cultured primary pituitary cells and gonadotrope-derived cell line, LbetaT2. These results advance our understanding of the complex mechanisms by which GnRH and steroid hormones achieve precise regulation of anterior pituitary function."

Here we present the results of experimental sex inversion in female chickens produced by aromatase inhibition and by the action of tamoxifen on chicken embryos. We have shown various masculinizing effect depending on the dose of active substance and the number of injections. We have noted that inhibition of aromatase does not block meiotic prophase in oogoniums. We have suggested that there are differences in the mechanisms of action of retinoic acid and estrogens on oogenesis. We have first shown proteins and nucleoproteins that interact with the estrogen receptor 1 and provided maps of their gene localization in human and chicken genomes."

The presence of distinctive ligand binding sites capable of interacting with small molecules has made NRs attractive targets for developing cancer therapeutics. In particular, a number of drugs have been developed over the years to target human androgen- and estrogen receptors for the treatment of prostate cancer and breast cancer. In contrast, orphan nuclear receptors (ONRs), which in many cases lack known biological functions or ligands, are still largely under investigated. This review is a summary on ONRs that have been implicated in prostate and breast cancers, specifically retinoic acid-receptor-related orphan receptors (RORs), liver X receptors (LXRs), chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factors (COUP-TFs), estrogen related receptors (ERRs), nerve growth factor 1B-like receptors, and ''dosage-sensitive sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia critical region, on chromosome X, gene 1'' (DAX1). Discovery and development of small molecules that can bind at various functional sites on these ONRs will help determine their biological functions. In addition, these molecules have the potential to act as prototypes for future drug development. Ultimately, the therapeutic value of targeting the ONRs may go well beyond prostate and breast cancers."

On the third day of incubation, fertile eggs were randomly assigned to five experimental groups comprising (i) Fadrozole (0.1 mg/egg), (ii) rhIGF-I (100 ng/egg), (iii) Fadrozole (0.1 mg/egg) + rhIGF-I (100 ng/egg), (iv) vehicle injection (10 mM acetic acid and 0.1% BSA), and (v) non-injected eggs. Eggs in the rhIGF-I-injected groups showed the mode of hatching time at the 480th hour of incubation, 12 hours earlier compared to the other groups, with no statistically significant difference in mortality and hatchability. On Day 1 and 42 of production, 90% of genetically female chicks were masculinized using Fadrozole treatment, while 100% female-to-male phenotypic sex reversal was observed in the Fadrozole+rhIGF-I group. Fadrozole equalized the body weight of both genders, although rhIGF-I was effective on the body weight of male chicks only. Interestingly, combined rhIGF-I and Fadrozole could increase the body weight in both sexes compared to the individual injections (P<0.05). These findings revealed that (i) IGF-I-treated chicken embryos were shown to be an effective option for overcoming the very long chicken deprivation period, (ii) the simultaneous treatment with Fadrozole and IGF-I could maximize the female-to-male sex reversal chance, (iii) the increase in the body weight of masculinized chickens via Fadrozole could be equal to their genetically male counterparts, and (iv) the IGF-I effectiveness, specifically along with the application of aromatase inhibitors in female chicks, indicates that estrogen synthesis could be a stumbling block for the IGF-I action mechanism in female embryos."

Print 2013.,"Estrogens play a key role in sexual differentiation of both the gonads and external traits in birds. The production of estrogen occurs via a well-characterised steroidogenic pathway, which is a multi-step process involving several enzymes, including cytochrome P450 aromatase. In chicken embryos, the aromatase gene (CYP19A1) is expressed female-specifically from the time of gonadal sex differentiation. To further explore the role of aromatase in sex determination, we ectopically delivered this enzyme using the retroviral vector RCASBP in ovo. Aromatase overexpression in male chicken embryos induced gonadal sex-reversal characterised by an enlargement of the left gonad and development of ovarian structures such as a thickened outer cortex and medulla with lacunae. In addition, the expression of key male gonad developmental genes (DMRT1, SOX9 and Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH)) was suppressed, and the distribution of germ cells in sex-reversed males followed the female pattern. The detection of SCP3 protein in late stage sex-reversed male embryonic gonads indicated that these genetically male germ cells had entered meiosis, a process that normally only occurs in female embryonic germ cells. This work shows for the first time that the addition of aromatase into a developing male embryo is sufficient to direct ovarian development, suggesting that male gonads have the complete capacity to develop as ovaries if provided with aromatase."

Epub 2013 Apr 23.,"Many reptiles, including the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta), possess a temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) mechanism where the temperature at which the developing embryos are incubated dictates the gonadal sex of the animal. A number of mammalian gene orthologues have been identified in the sex determination/differentiation cascade of reptiles with TSD although the exact trigger(s) is not well understood. A potential early regulator of gonadal differentiation, Lhx9, controls the proliferation of gonadal cells in mice and its absence prevents gonadal development and drastically reduces the expression of Sf-1, a gene that regulates the expression of steroidogenic enzymes in the bipotential gonad. In the current study, we cloned Lhx9 from T. scripta and analyzed its expression throughout the thermosensitive period of gonad development using quantitative PCR. We examined the expression profiles of Lhx9 in embryos incubated under control conditions at male- and female-producing temperatures and with the application of exogenous 17beta-estradiol or an aromatase inhibitor, Letrozole, to induce sex reversal. The T. scripta Lhx9 cDNA and predicted amino acid sequence showed high homology to those of chicken, anole, and mouse. Lhx9 was expressed at both male- and female-producing temperatures with expression levels increasing throughout the thermosensitive period. Letrozole induced sex-reversal did not alter Lhx9 expression levels. 17beta-estradiol treatments appeared to inhibit or delay gonadal differentiation and resulted in lower Lhx9 expression from the presumptive gonadal ridge region. The structural homology and temporal expression pattern of Lhx9 suggests that this represents a conserved element in the gonadal differentiation cascade of T. scripta."

Although the mechanisms of avian sex determination remains unknown, the genetic sex is experimentally reversible by in ovo exposure to exogenous estrogens (ZZ-male feminization) or aromatase inhibitors (ZW-female masculinization). Expression of various testis- and ovary-specific marker genes during the normal and reversed gonadal sex differentiation in chicken embryos has been extensively studied, but the roles of sex-specific epigenetic marks in sex differentiation are unknown. In this study, we show that a 170-nt region in the promoter of CYP19A1/aromatase, a key gene required for ovarian estrogen biosynthesis and feminization of chicken embryonic gonads, contains highly quantitative, nucleotide base-level epigenetic marks that reflect phenotypic gonadal sex differentiation. We developed a protocol to feminize ZZ-male chicken embryonic gonads in a highly quantitative manner by direct injection of emulsified ethynylestradiol into yolk at various developmental stages. Taking advantage of this experimental sex reversal model, we show that the epigenetic sex marks in the CYP19A1/aromatase promoter involving DNA methylation and histone lysine methylation are feminized significantly but only partially in sex-converted gonads even when morphological and transcriptional marks of sex differentiation show complete feminization, being indistinguishable from gonads of normal ZW females. Our study suggests that the epigenetic sex of chicken embryonic gonads is more stable than the morphologically or transcriptionally characterized sex differentiation, suggesting the importance of the nucleotide base-level epigenetic sex in gonadal sex differentiation."

Epub 2011 May 3.,"The objective of the current study was to analyze the methylation status of the chicken male hypermethylation (cMHM) region and mRNA expression levels of sex-dependent genes in adult female-to-male sex-reversed chickens. Sex reversal from genetic females into phenotypic males was induced by injection of 1.0 mg fadrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, into fertilized eggs at 3.0 days of incubation. Birds aged 30 weeks were classified into 4 groups according to the histological structure of their gonads and the natural logarithm of the ratio of testosterone to estradiol in serum, namely standard females, slightly sex-reversed females with left ovotestes, highly sex-reversed females with left testes, and standard males. The results showed that methylation of the cMHM amplicon was lowest in the ovaries of standard females and highest in testes of standard males. Methylation levels were significantly higher in the left testes of highly sex-reversed females than in the left ovotestes of slightly sex-reversed females (p < 0.05). Expression analysis of 9 sex-specific genes in the gonad indicated that DMRT1 and HINTZ had a similar expression pattern, with significantly higher levels in standard males as compared to standard females, slightly and highly sex-reversed females (p < 0.05). Expression of FOXL2, AMH, P450arom, SF1, and ERalpha was obviously higher in standard females than in standard males, slightly and highly sex-reversed females (p < 0.05). Expression of SOX9 in standard females was similar to that in slightly sex-reversed females and lower than in highly sex-reversed females and standard males (p < 0.05)."

Epub 2011 Mar 9.,"Tissue-specific patterns of microRNA (miRNA) expression contribute to organogenesis during embryonic development. Using the embryonic chicken gonads as a model for vertebrate gonadogenesis, we previously reported that miRNAs are expressed in a sexually dimorphic manner during gonadal sex differentiation. Being male biased, we hypothesised that up-regulation of microRNA 202* (MIR202*) is characteristic of testicular differentiation. To address this hypothesis, we used estrogen modulation to induce gonadal sex reversal in embryonic chicken gonads and analyzed changes in MIR202* expression. In ovo injection of estradiol-17beta at Embryonic Day 4.5 (E4.5) caused feminization of male gonads at E9.5 and reduced MIR202* expression to female levels. Female gonads treated at E3.5 with an aromatase inhibitor, which blocks estrogen synthesis, were masculinized by E9.5, and MIR202* expression was increased. Reduced MIR202* expression correlated with reduced expression of the testis-associated genes DMRT1 and SOX9, and up-regulation of ovary-associated genes FOXL2 and CYP19A1 (aromatase). Increased MIR202* expression correlated with down-regulation of FOXL2 and aromatase and up-regulation of DMRT1 and SOX9. These results confirm that up-regulation of MIR202* coincides with testicular differentiation in embryonic chicken gonads."

The GSP and PNP/DO inbred lines were both derived from the Fayoumi breed and are only differentiated based on the red blood cell antigen type carried by each inbred line. Combs and wattles were found to be significantly bigger (P<0.05) in the GSP ovx compared with the PNP/DO ovx chickens, although male plumage patterns were more pronounced in the PNP/DO ovx. Spurs were observed both in the GSP and PNP/DO ovx chickens with no significant difference (P>0.05) in length compared with the respective male controls, and body weight was not significantly different (P>0.05) compared with the female controls. The weight of the right gonad was significantly heavier (P<0.05) in the GSP ovx than in the PNP/DO ovx. Positive correlations were found in the sex-related characters as well as the plasma testosterone level and right gonad weight in both the GSP and PNP/DO ovx chickens, but not in the spur length, which showed a negative correlation in the PNP/DO ovx chickens. Histological analysis revealed that the right gonads of the PNP/DO ovx chickens were morphologically developed compared with the GSP ovx chickens, which showed more advance stages of spermatogenesis. It could be inferred that PNP/DO females that exhibit a hereditary persistent right oviduct are more responsive to the masculinizing effect of ovariectomy compared with GSP females, suggesting that genetic background may have a possible contribution to the degree of masculinization and subsequent development of sex related characters."

Epub 2009 Aug 26.,"Sex in birds is chromosomally based, as in mammals, but the sex chromosomes are different and the mechanism of avian sex determination has been a long-standing mystery. In the chicken and all other birds, the homogametic sex is male (ZZ) and the heterogametic sex is female (ZW). Two hypotheses have been proposed for the mechanism of avian sex determination. The W (female) chromosome may carry a dominant-acting ovary determinant. Alternatively, the dosage of a Z-linked gene may mediate sex determination, two doses being required for male development (ZZ). A strong candidate avian sex-determinant under the dosage hypothesis is the conserved Z-linked gene, DMRT1 (doublesex and mab-3-related transcription factor 1). Here we used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down DMRT1 in early chicken embryos. Reduction of DMRT1 protein expression in ovo leads to feminization of the embryonic gonads in genetically male (ZZ) embryos. Affected males show partial sex reversal, characterized by feminization of the gonads. The feminized left gonad shows female-like histology, disorganized testis cords and a decline in the testicular marker, SOX9. The ovarian marker, aromatase, is ectopically activated. The feminized right gonad shows a more variable loss of DMRT1 and ectopic aromatase activation, suggesting differential sensitivity to DMRT1 between left and right gonads. Germ cells also show a female pattern of distribution in the feminized male gonads. These results indicate that DMRT1 is required for testis determination in the chicken. Our data support the Z dosage hypothesis for avian sex determination."

Epub 2009 Mar 10.,"Injection of an aromatase inhibitor before gonadal sex differentiation can induce female-to-male sex reversal in chicken, but a higher dose could reduce hatchability. In the present study, the dosage effect of Fadrozole, a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, on gonadal differentiation was analyzed in sex-reversed genetic female chicken. There was no significant difference for the hatchability among low-dose (0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 mg) Fadrozole-injected groups and control groups (p > 0.05), but in high-dose groups (1.0 mg and 1.3 mg) the hatchability was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). Complete phenotypic sex reversal was observed in both high- and low- dose groups, with more than 90% of genetic females reversed into phenotypic male chicks. The degree of gonadal differentiation in 124 chicken at 30 weeks of age was classified into 5 categories according to the visual appearance and histological structure of the gonads. Category I and V were standard ovary and testis, respectively, while category II, III, and IV represented gonads of slightly, moderately, and highly sex-reversed females, respectively. Most gonads in low-dose groups were classified into category I, II, and III, while those in high-dose groups were mainly category IV. The serum testosterone levels in the 1.3 mg group were significantly higher and the estradiol levels lower than those in low-dose groups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the range from 0.5 to 1.0 mg Fadrozole is a key interval for survival of chicken embryos. The gonadal differentiation in sex-reversed females at 30 weeks of age is highly dependent on the dose of Fadrozole injected prior to gonadal sex differentiation."

Blastoderms were fixed, cleaved, nuclei stained by 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylin-dole, and developmental stages were assessed. In the normal rooster group, ejaculated and testicular sperm induced blastodermal development in 22.6 and 20% of the quail oocytes, respectively. The developmental stages ranged from IV to VII. In the sex-reversal group, 20% of injected testicular sperm induced blastodermal development. The blastodermal stages varied from stage III to VI. Blastoderms after 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining were assayed by PCR to identify the W chromosome of either chicken sperm or quail oocyte. The PCR assay results showed that 2 out of 9 developed blastoderms microinjected with sperm of sex-reversed hen were identified containing the female-specific W chromosome derived from sex-reversed hen. From these results, it is concluded that chicken sperm bearing the W chromosome possess fertilizing ability and can function to stimulate blastoderm development similar to that of normal chicken sperm carrying the Z chromosome."

In the present study, sex reversal was induced by injection of a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (Fadrozole) into the air sac of the chicken egg on d 4 of incubation, and the chicks were reared to 18 mo old. A single elongated spermatid or sperm was isolated from the testis from either normal roosters or sex-reversed hens, and each was microinjected into a mouse oocyte and cultured for 24 h. Although injected oocytes were monitored on the stage of microscope, they were classified into groups by the number of pronuclei. Those that showed male and female pronuclei (2PN) were considered to have oocyte-activating potency. In the normal rooster group, most semen and testicular sperm induced 2PN, whereas only half of the elongated spermatids induced 2PN. In the sex-reversal group, most testicular sperm induced 2PN, whereas nearly half of the elongated spermatids induced 2PN in the oocytes. There was no pronucleus in the oocytes after microinjection of medium only. A second experiment confirmed the higher rate of oocyte activation by testicular sperm than testicular elongated spermatids. In this second experiment, individual oocytes injected with spermatids and sperm of sex-reversed hens were assayed by PCR to identify the W chromosome. Most spermatids and sperm carried Z chromosome, whereas a minority carried W chromosome. However, the sperm carrying W chromosome evoked 2PN with the same rate of oocyte activation as those carrying Z chromosome. From these results, it is concluded that the chicken elongated spermatids and sperm carrying W chromosome may possess a fertilizing ability similar to normal chicken sperm carrying the Z chromosome."

DMRT1 expression was higher in male (ZZ) gonads than in female (ZW) gonad prior to and throughout the period of sex differentiation. However, female-to-male sex-reversed ZW embryos showed elevated levels of DMRT1 expression similar to those of normal males, indicating that DMRT1 was associated with testis development. PKCIW gene expression was dimorphic between male and female gonads, and was up-regulated in AI-treated female embryos. This finding might account for the specific effect of PKCIW, functioning via heterodimerization with PKCI during avian sex determination. However, its elevated expression appeared to be insufficient to induce ovary development. On the other hand, FET1 expression was female-specific and unchanged in AI-treated female embryos. Results of present experiment suggested that DMRT1 is a determinant for testis development in birds."

The cDNA sequence of this gene was 1860 bp in length,encoding a 375 amino acid protein. Amino acid identities of the beta-actin between the rice field eel and other vertebrates including human, chicken, and other fishes, were more than 98%. RT-PCR showed expression of the rice field eel beta-actin in testis, ovotestis, ovary, heart, liver, spleen and brain,suggesting a ubiquitous expression pattern. Phylogenetic tree including all beta-actin cds of teleost fishes was constructed,which suggested consistently that teleost beta-actin can be classified into four types,but no fish has been found contains all the four types of beta-actin gene in its genome. The results that suggest lineage-specific beta-actin loss might happen in the radical evolution of teleost fishes."

Aromatase is expressed specifically in female gonads, but not male gonads, at the onset of sexual differentiation. This enzyme shows temporal and spatial colocalization with the forkhead transcription factor FOXL2 in the embryonic chicken ovary, suggesting a causal link. Mutations in FOXL2 are associated with premature ovarian failure in humans. Foxl2 null mice also present with premature ovarian failure. Here, we show that FOXL2 expression is reduced but not abolished in chicken embryos subjected to experimental female to male sex-reversal with an aromatase inhibitor. This finding suggests that FOXL2 lies upstream of aromatase in avian sex determination, but that it responds to depleted estrogen synthesis. The reduction in FOXL2 expression may be accounted for by interruption of a positive feedback loop by means of estrogen, or the influence of testis promoting factors such as SOX9 and DMRT1 in the masculinized gonads."

Here, we report the sex-specific and left-right (L-R) asymmetric expression pattern of Bmp7 in the chicken gonadogenesis. Bmp7 was L-R asymmetrically expressed at the beginning of genital ridge formation. After sexual differentiation occurred, sex-specific expression pattern of Bmp7 was observed in the ovary mesenchyme. In addition, ovary-specific Bmp7 expression was reduced in experimentally induced female-to-male reversal using the aromatase inhibitor (AI). These dynamic changes of expression pattern of Bmp7 in the gonad with or without AI treatment suggest that BMP may play roles in determination of L-R asymmetric development and sex-dependent differentiation in the avian gonadogenesis."

To test the hypothesis that Gln127 of Asw is responsible for depression and/or alteration of Hint enzyme activity, a corresponding mutant was created in the chicken Hint homodimer, and a novel substrate was developed that links reversal of AMP-lysine modification to aminomethylcoumarin release. Strikingly, the Hint-W123Q substitution reduced k(cat)/K(m) for AMP-lysine hydrolysis 17-fold, while it increased specificity for AMP-para-nitroaniline hydrolysis by 160-fold. The resulting 2,700-fold switch in enzyme specificity suggests that Gln127 could be the dominant component of Asw dominant negativity in avian feminization."

The grouper mature TSHbeta has 75, 70, 61, 59, 41, 42 and 40% identities to that of rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon, zebrafish, European eel, chicken, mouse and human, respectively. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the TSHbeta mRNA was expressed abundantly not only in pituitary but also in gonads. A more interesting finding is to reveal the differential TSHbeta expressions between the ovaries and the transitional gonads or testes in natural individuals of orange-spotted grouper and red-spotted grouper Epinephelus akaara, and in artificial sex reversal individuals of red-spotted grouper induced by MT feeding. In situ hybridization localization provided direct evidence that the TSHbeta was transcribed in the germ cells. In the growing oocytes, the TSHbeta transcripts were concentrated on the ooplasm periphery. In testicular tissues, the intensively expressed TSHbeta cells were found to be spermatogonia and spermatocytes in the spermatogenic cysts. This is the first report of a TSHbeta expressed in the gonads of any vertebrates in addition to the expected expression in the pituitary, and it expresses more transcripts in the gonads during sex reversal or testis than in the ovaries both in E. coioides and E. akaara. Importantly, the TSHbeta identification in germ cells allows us to further investigate the functional roles and the molecular mechanisms in gametogenesis of groupers, especially in sex reversal and in spermatogenesis."

Although putative ligands for these orphan members remain to be identified, some of these receptors possess intrinsic activating, inhibitory, or dual regulatory functions in development, differentiation, homeostasis, and reproduction. In particular, gene-silencing events elicited by chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors (COUP-TFs); dosage-sensitive sex reversal-adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1 (DAX-1); germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF); short heterodimer partner (SHP); and testicular receptors 2 and 4 (TR2 and TR4) are among the best characterized. These orphan receptors are critical in controlling basal activities or hormonal responsiveness of numerous target genes. They employ multiple and distinct mechanisms to mediate target gene repression. Complex cross-talk exists between these orphan receptors at their cognate DNA binding elements and an array of steroid?nonsteroid hormone receptors, other transcriptional activators, coactivators and corepressors, histone modification enzyme complexes, and components of basal transcriptional components. Therefore, perturbation induced by these orphan receptors at multiple levels, including DNA binding activities, receptor homo- or heterodimerization, recruitment of cofactor proteins, communication with general transcriptional machinery, and changes at histone acetylation status and chromatin structures, may contribute to silencing of target gene expression in a specific promoter or cell-type context. Moreover, the findings derived from gene-targeting studies have demonstrated the significance of these orphan receptors' function in physiologic settings. Thus, COUP-TFs, DAX-1, GCNF, SHP, and TR2 and 4 are known to be required for multiple physiologic and biologic functions, including neurogenesis and development of the heart and vascular system steroidogenesis and sex determination, gametogenesis and embryonic development, and cholesterol?lipid homeostasis."

Eggs were injected with 1 mg Fadrozole on day 4 of incubation. In females having developed sex-reversed gonads, endocrine parameters (estradiol and testosterone) at and after 13 weeks of age were indicative of the degree of sex reversal, with, for example, sex-reversed females with two testes having the highest levels of testosterone and the lowest levels of estradiol. Among these females, eight (from a total of 13) produced ejaculates with scarce and abnormal spermatozoa. Some motility was observable in the ejaculates from five of them. None of the post-hatch treatments had a significant effect on plasma levels of testosterone or estradiol (measured at 3-week intervals from week 4 to week 28 post-hatch) or on gonadal aromatase activity (measured at 12 and 28 weeks). In conclusion, these results indicate that plasma levels of testosterone and estradiol at and after 13 weeks of age are valuable indicators of the degree of sex reversal in female chickens treated with Fadrozole prior to gonadal sex differentiation. In pre-cited conditions, post-natal treatments with either Fadrozole or Fadrozole + testosterone had no apparent effect on the degree of sex reversal in these birds. Finally, the occurrence of ejaculates with motile although scarce and abnormal spermatozoa, revealed that epididymes and ducti deferens can develop and become functional in sex-reversed female chickens."
12533420,DMRT1 is upregulated in the gonads during female-to-male sex reversal in ZW chicken embryos.,"Smith CA, Katz M, Sinclair AH",Biol Reprod. 2003 Feb;68(2):560-70. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.102.007294.,"Sex in birds is chomosomally based (ZZ male, ZW female), but the mechanism underlying sex determination remains unknown. An unresolved question is whether Z gene dosage plays a role in avian sex determination. DMRT1 is an avian Z-linked gene that shows higher expression in male gonads during embryogenesis and has been proposed as a putative testis-determining gene in birds. The Z-linkage of this gene makes it an ideal candidate for testing the question of gene dosage in avian testis determination. A higher level of DMRT1 expression in male (ZZ) versus female (ZW) embryonic gonads may reflect the presence of two Z-linked copies in the male, or it may be due to specific and active upregulation of DMRT1 during testis formation. A functional interventionist strategy was used to distinguish between these two possibilities. DMRT1 expression was analyzed in chicken embryos during experimentally induced female-to-male sex reversal, using the aromatase enzyme inhibitor fadrozole. DMRT1 expression was analyzed by whole mount in situ hybridization and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (for mRNA) and indirect immunofluorescence (for protein). Female-to-male sex-reversed embryos (genetically ZW) showed elevated levels of DMRT1 expression similar to those of normal males (with two copies of the Z chromosome). Elevated levels of DMRT1 are therefore associated with testis development, both in normal males (ZZ) and in sex-reversed females (ZW). SOX9 expression was also activated during female-to-male sex reversal but appeared delayed relative to DMRT1 upregulation. These results show that testis development does not require two Z-linked copies of DMRT1, but it does involve active upregulation of the gene. Higher levels of DMRT1 expression during testis differentiation therefore do not simply reflect a gene dosage difference between the two sexes but imply active involvement in male development."

In contrast, the heterogametic sex in avian species is the female and the presence of estrogens and their receptors plays a crucial role in female sexual differentiation. The time- and sex-dependent expression of enzymes involved in steroidogenesis which determine the ratio of androgens/estrogens produced by the gonads has been extensively investigated during the last 5-6 years. These results all show that the lack of estrogen synthesis in the male appears to be due to the extremely low levels of 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and P450aromatase expression. In females, extensive expression of the aromatase gene (around day 5-6 of incubation), leading to estrogen synthesis, and specific expression of the estrogen receptor-mRNA in the left gonad results in the development of a functional left ovary. Other sex differences can be found in the expression of the inhibin subunit genes in gonads of chicken embryos and in circulating concentrations of inhibin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and steroids. Sex reversal attempts have been made by varying incubation temperatures, by using anti-estrogens, androgens, aromatase inhibitors and synthetic steroids. In ovo administration of a sex steroid hormone or an inhibitor of endogenous sex steroid synthesis can cause phenotypical sex reversal. All these experiments show that the development of gonads in birds is very sensitive to changes in the embryonic hormonal environment, sometimes resulting in changes of postnatal reproduction and even growth."
11748621,Sex reversal and aromatase in chicken.,"Vaillant S, Dorizzi M, Pieau C, Richard-Mercier N",J Exp Zool. 2001 Dec 1;290(7):727-40. doi: 10.1002/jez.1123.,"Aromatase inhibitors administered before sexual differentiation of the gonads can induce sex reversal in female chickens. To analyze the process of sex reversal, we have followed for several months the changes induced by Fadrozole, a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, in gonadal aromatase activity and in morphology and structure of the female genital system. Fadrozole was injected into eggs on day four of incubation, and its effects were examined during the embryonic development and for eight months after hatching. In control females, aromatase activity in the right and the left gonad was high in the middle third of embryonic development, and then decreased up to hatching. After hatching, aromatase activity increased in the left ovary, in particular during folliculogenesis, whereas in the right regressing gonad, it continued to decrease to reach testicular levels at one month. In treated females, masculinization of the genital system was characterized by the maintenance of the right gonad and its differentiation into a testis, and by the differentiation of the left gonad into an ovotestis or a testis; however, in all individuals, the left Mullerian duct and the posterior part of the right Mullerian duct were maintained. In testes and ovotestes, aromatase activity was lower than in gonads of control females (except in the right gonad as of one month after hatching) but remained higher than in testes of control and treated males. Moreover, in ovotestes, aromatase activity was higher in parts displaying follicles than in parts devoid of follicles. The main structural changes in the gonads during sex reversal were partial (in ovotestes) or complete (in testes) degeneration of the cortex in the left gonad, and formation of an albuginea and differentiation of testicular cords/tubes in the two gonads. Testicular cords/tubes transdifferentiated from ovarian medullary cords and lacunae whose epithelium thickened and became Sertolian. Transdifferentiation occurred all along embryonic and postnatal development; thus, new testicular cords/tubes were continuously formed while others degenerated. The sex reversed gonads were also characterized by an abundant fibrous interstitial tissue and abnormal medullary condensations of lymphoid-like cells; in the persisting testicular cords/tubes, spermatogenesis was delayed and impaired. Related to aromatase activity, persistence of too high levels of estrogens can explain the presence of oviducts, gonadal abnormalities and infertility in sex reversed females."

To date, Dax-1 has only been isolated in reptiles, birds and mammals. The expression of Dax-1 is down-regulated in the developing testis, but persists in the ovary of mice (Swain et al., Nat. Genet. 12 (1996) 404) and chicken (Smith et al., J. Mol. Endocrinol. 24 (2000) 23). Curiously, there is no sex difference in the expression patterns of Dax-1 in the American alligator (Western et al., Gene 241 (2000) 223). To understand its role(s) in gonadal development in vertebrates, molecular cloning of Dax-1 in amphibians is required. In this study, we cloned an amphibian Dax-1 homologue of the frog Rana rugosa and examined its expression profile during gonadal development. Cloned Dax-1 cDNA encoded a protein of 287 amino acids. Unlike mammalians that possess the three and one half repeat elements representing the putative DNA binding domain in the predicted sequence of Dax-1 protein, the frog had a single poorly conserved copy of the repeat unit. By RT-PCR analysis, the Dax-1 mRNA was detected in the liver and pancreas, but not in the testis and ovary of adult frogs. However, Dax-1 expression was seen first in the embryo at stage 12 and became stronger in tadpoles until stage X. The Dax-1 was transcribed in the testis stronger than in the ovary of frogs at stage XXV (just after completion of metamorphosis). In the gonad of frogs 2 months after metamorphosis (at this stage postmeiotic cells can be seen in the seminiferous tubules), the Dax-1 was expressed only in males. In addition, the Dax-1 transcription declined gradually as ovarian development proceeded, but its expression was down-regulated and then up-regulated rapidly when female-to-male sex reversal was caused by administration of testosterone into female tadpoles. Taken together, the results suggest that the Dax-1 may be closely involved in testicular development of amphibians."
11668600,"Expression of AMH, SF1, and SOX9 in gonads of genetic female chickens during sex reversal induced by an aromatase inhibitor.","Vaillant S, Magre S, Dorizzi M, Pieau C, Richard-Mercier N",Dev Dyn. 2001 Oct;222(2):228-37. doi: 10.1002/dvdy.1190.,"Aromatase inhibitors administered prior to histological signs of gonadal sex differentiation can induce sex reversal of genetic female chickens. Under the effects of Fadrozole (CGS 16949A), a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, the right gonad generally becomes a testis, and the left gonad a testis or an ovotestis. We have compared the expression pattern of the genes encoding AMH (the anti-Mullerian hormone), SF1 (steroidogenic factor 1), and SOX9 (a transcription factor related to SRY) in these sex-reversed gonads with that in control testes and ovaries, using in situ hybridization with riboprobes on gonadal sections. In control males, the three genes are expressed in Sertoli cells of testicular cords; however, only SOX9 is male specific, since as observed previously AMH and SF1 but not SOX9 are expressed in the control female gonads. In addition to testicular-like cords, sex-reversed gonads present many lacunae with a composite, thick and flat epithelium. We show that during embryonic and postnatal development, AMH, SF1 and SOX9 are expressed in the epithelium of testicular-like cords and in the thickened part but not in the flattened part of the epithelium of composite lacunae. AMH and SF1 but not SOX9 are expressed in follicular cells of ovotestes. Coexpression of the three genes, of which SOX9 is a specific Sertoli-cell marker, provides strong evidence for the transdifferentiation of ovarian into testicular epithelium in gonads of female chickens treated with Fadrozole."

Unlike mammals, sex determination in birds operates through a ZZ/ZW sex chromosome system, in which the female is the heterogametic sex. However, the molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Comparative gene mapping revealed that several genes on human chromosome 9 (HSA 9) have homologs on the chicken Z chromosome (GGA Z), indicating the common ancestry of large parts of GGA Z and HSA 9. Based on chromosome homology maps, we isolated a Z-linked chicken ortholog of DMRT1, which has been implicated in XY sex reversal in humans. Its location on the avian Z and within the sex-reversal region on HSA 9p suggests that DMRT1 represents an ancestral dosage-sensitive gene for vertebrate sex-determination. Z dosage may be crucial for male sexual differentiation/determination in birds."

SOX genes are expressed during embryogenesis and are involved in the development of a wide range of different tissues. Mutations in SRY, SOX9 and SOX10 have been shown to be responsible for XY sex reversal, campomelic dysplasia and Waardenburg-Hirschsprung disease, respectively. It is likely that mutations in other SOX genes are responsible for a variety of human genetic diseases. SOX14 has been identified from a human genomic library and the mouse and chicken sequences obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification. The SOX14 amino acid sequence is highly conserved across these species, suggesting an important role for this protein in vertebrate development. SOX14 is expressed in the neural tube and apical ectodermal ridge of the developing chicken limb. This is the only SOX gene known to be expressed in the apical ectodermal ridge, a structure that directs outgrowth of the embryonic limb bud. Human SOX14 is localised to a 1.15-Mb yeast artificial chromosome on chromosome 3q23, close to loci for BPES (blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome) and Mobius syndrome. Although SOX14 maps outside these loci, its expression pattern and chromosomal localisation suggest that it is a candidate gene for the limb defects frequently associated with these syndromes."

Mutations in human DAX1 cause X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita, while abnormal duplication of the gene is responsible for male-to-female dosage-sensitive sex reversal. Based on these and other observations, DAX1 is thought to play a role in adrenal and gonadal development in mammals. As DAX1 has not previously been described in any other vertebrate, a putative avian DAX1 clone was isolated from an embryonic chicken (Gallus domesticus) urogenital ridge cDNA library. The expression profile of this cDNA was then examined during gonadogenesis. The clone included the conserved 3' ligand-binding motif identified in humans and mice but the 5' region lacked the repeat motif thought to specify a DNA-binding domain in mammals. Southern blot analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridisation mapping showed that the gene is autosomal, located on chromosome 1q. Sequence comparisons showed that the putative chicken DAX1 protein has 63 and 60% identity with the human and mouse proteins respectively over the region of the conserved ligand-binding domain. However, stronger identity (74%) exists with a putative alligator DAX1 sequence over the same region. Northern blotting detected a single 1.4 kb transcript in late embryonic chicken gonads, while RNase protection assays revealed expression in the embryonic gonads of both sexes during the period of sexual differentiation. Expression increased in both sexes during gonadogenesis, but was higher in females than in males. This is the first description of a DAX1 homologue in a non-mammalian vertebrate."

The effects of oestrogen on lutropin receptor expression were studied to investigate the mechanism controlling this difference. Lutropin receptor mRNA expression was detected in the ovaries of sesame oil-treated control female embryos on day 12 of incubation, while no expression was found in the testes of the male controls. Oestradiol administration to genetically male embryos before sexual differentiation resulted in gonadal sex reversal which was characterized histologically by the proliferation of cortical cords and the presence of lacunae. Lutropin receptor expression was detected in the feminizing testis on day 12 of incubation. Administration of aromatase inhibitor (CGS 16949 A) to genetically female embryos before sexual differentiation inhibited the formation of cortical cords, although a relatively weak expression of lutropin receptor was detected. These results indicate that early expression of the lutropin receptor is regulated by oestrogen."
9662831,Gene expression of steroidogenic enzymes in chicken embryonic gonads.,Shimada K,J Exp Zool. 1998 Aug 1;281(5):450-6.,"This paper reviews the molecular aspects of sex differentiation in birds and describes the sex-reversal effects of aromatase inhibitor on mRNA expression of steroidogenic enzymes. Although it is unknown whether the sex-determining gene resides in the W chromosome or whether a gene-dosage mechanism is involved in sex determination, it is clear that anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and androgen play a key role for testicular development, whereas estrogen is important for ovarian formation. Our in situ hybridization results demonstrated that mRNA expression of P450aromatase first takes place on day 6.5 of incubation exclusively in the female gonad. Treatment with aromatase inhibitor in ovo suppressed mRNA expression in genetic females. This suggests that ovarian development is promoted by aromatase expression via estrogen production. On the other hand, previous reports demonstrated that formation of the testis is accompanied by Sox9 and AMH mRNA expression, which start on days 6 and 8, respectively. This suggests that Sox9 plays an important role for the male determining pathway which leads to AMH expression and formation of the testis."
8787755,A male-specific role for SOX9 in vertebrate sex determination.,"Kent J, Wheatley SC, Andrews JE, Sinclair AH, Koopman P",Development. 1996 Sep;122(9):2813-22.,"Mutation analyses of patients with campomelic dysplasia, a bone dysmorphology and XY sex reversal syndrome, indicate that the SRY-related gene SOX9 is involved in both skeletal development and sex determination. To clarify the role SOX9 plays in vertebrate sex determination, we have investigated its expression during gonad development in mouse and chicken embryos. In the mouse, high levels of Sox9 mRNA were found in male (XY) but not female (XX) genital ridges, and were localised to the sex cords of the developing testis. Purified fetal germ cells lacked Sox9 expression, indicating that Sox9 expression is specific to the Sertoli cell lineage. Sex specificity of SOX9 protein expression was confirmed using a polyclonal antiserum. The timing and cell-type specificity of Sox9 expression suggests that Sox9 may be directly regulated by SRY. Male-specific expression of cSOX9 mRNA during the sex determination period was also observed in chicken genital ridges. The conservation of sexually dimorphic expression in two vertebrate classes which have significant differences in their sex determination mechanisms, points to a fundamental role for SOX9 in testis determination in vertebrates. Sox9 expression was maintained in the mouse testis during fetal and adult life, but no expression was seen at any stage by in situ hybridisation in the developing ovary. Male-specific expression was also observed in the cells surrounding the Mullerian ducts and in the epididymis, and expression in both sexes was detected in the developing collecting ducts of the metanephric kidney. These results suggest that SOX9 may have a wider role in the development of the genitourinary system."

Consistent with a role in sex determination, we find that Sox9 expression closely follows differentiation of Sertoli cells in the mouse testis, in experimental sex reversal when fetal ovaries are grafted to adult kidneys and in the chick where there is no evidence for a Sry gene. Our results imply that Sox9 plays an essential role in sex determination, possibly immediately downstream of Sry in mammals, and that it functions as a critical Sertoli cell differentiation factor, perhaps in all vertebrates."

Individual genetic sex was evaluated by Southern blot analysis of red blood cells using a female sex chromosomal W-specific DNA probe. Saline injection had no sex reversal effect, whereas AI injection resulted in 50% sex reversal from genetic female but no effect on male. Levels of P450(17-alpha) mRNA were high in both ovary and testis in the control group but these levels were lowered significantly in ovary, testis, and sex-reversed gonad (testis) in the AI-treated group. On the other hand, levels of P450(arom) mRNA in the ovary were higher than those in the testis of the control group. AI treatment significantly suppressed ovarian levels of P450(arom) mRNA. Although estradiol alone failed to prevent the phenotypic male to female change, coadministration of estrogen suppressed the sex-reversal effect of AI and restored mRNA levels of P450(arom) in the ovary to control levels. These results suggest that expression of P450(arom) mRNA and estrogen plays an important role in sex differentiation of the female gonad of the chicken."

It allows to obtain a masculinization of female host embryos developing in some cases up to a total and definitive reversal of sex differentiation. Indeed, it is possible, by this way to obtain testes induced under the influence of substance(s) secreted by the grafts which determine epigenetically a sexual phenotype opposite to the genotype of the host embryos. The analysis of such testis morphogenesis shows that it results from an inhibitory mechanism. Some experimental data strongly suggest to ascribe it to the anti-Mullerian hormone secreted by the graft. The ovotestes and testes observed in adult treated animals present various degrees of development, especially at the level of seminiferous tubules in which the spermatogenesis, when present, may be completed until spermatozoa. Some gonadal abnormalities interesting genetically female human beings, like a majority of the hermaphrodites, or certain XX men, are discussed at the light of these experimental data."

Control female chicks were not found to have brain asymmetry. Testosterone treatment (12.5 mg of testosterone oenanthate on day 2 posthatch) reversed the pattern of brain asymmetry observed in control males but not females.

This sex reversal remains permanent, as shown by three adult fowls described in this paper. They possess two testes associated with normally differentiated male excretory ducts and their Mullerian ducts have regressed. The development of male sex characteristics such as external features, behavior and complete spermatogenesis is evidence that these cocks have endocrine and exocrine capabilities similar to those of normal cocks. Although these cocks were able to mate with female fowls, they were sterile. A mechanism is discussed by which grafted testes induce such modifications in females. Hypotheses considering the heterogametic sex (female in birds) as exerting a dominant influence on the phenotypic sexual differentiation can be discarded in light of our results because a homogametic testis provokes the definitive sex inversion of a female."

Incomplete left ovariectomy can induce either a sterile or fertile ovariotestoid or a sterile testoid. In comparison with the normal testis the right testoid of sex-reversed hens shows many abnormalities: The size of the testoid of juvenile sex-reversed hens is only about 10 x 2 mm and those of the adults about 20 x 10 mm. First signs of maturation division are visible 25 weeks after hatching, i.e. a retardation of 8 weeks. The histology of the testoids is very heteromorphic and considerably different from that of a normal testis. The spermatogenic parenchyma consists of supporting-cell-areas (SERTOLI-cell only tissue), sterile testis-cords (SERTOLI-cell only cords) and of fertile testis-cords. According to the differentiation of the germ cells and supporting cells respectively, the testis cords are subdivided into 4 stages. Spermatogenesis is stopped in the spermatid stage and it is impossible to enforce further maturation by utilizing the direct spermatogenic effect of high androgen doses. The ultimate component of the blood-testis barrier, the inter-SERTOLI-cell junctions, is visible neither in the sterile nor the fertile testis-cords. Thus, as far as the immune system is concerned, the haploid germ cells are acting like endogenic foreign-body cells. This becomes apparent by severe cell death and finally by a total destruction of testis-cords. The interstitial-glandular parenchyma consists of testicular single-interstitial-cells (LEYDIG-cells), ovarian interstitial-cell-nodules and interstitial-cell-areas. Statements concerning the qualitative and quantitative ability of the interstitial cells are made using morphological criteria and by consideration of test data in steroid-hormones. As to the atypical cytomorphology of interstitial-cells (4 types are distinguishable) distinct deviations in the hormonal status are visible in comparison with male controls: The testosterone concentration in plasma is decreased by the factor or 8.4, while the estradiol concentration is increased by the factor of 4.3. Attempts at normalizing the testosterone concentration by experimental stimulation with gonadotrophins failed. It is obvious that the interstitial-cell-nodules, the interstitial-cell-areas as well as the supporting cells originate from epithelial cells of the medullary cords (Chordae medullares) and from the epithelial cells of the distended medullary cords (Lacunae medullares). In other words the above mentioned cells are of epitheliogenic origin."

In birds, the heterogametic female sex is H-Y antigen positive, and not the male as in mammals. Cocultivation of rat and chicken testicular cells results in the reorganization of an ovotestis. A similar result is obtained after cultivation of chicken testicular cells in the supernatant medium of cultured human male Burkitt lymphoma Daudi cells. Rat testicular Sertoli cells as well as Daudi cells are a source of H-Y antigen. The simultaneous application of H-Y antigen and anti-H-Y antiserum prevents ovotestis formation. It is concluded that H-Y antigen which is known to be testis-organizing in mammals, is the ovary-organizing factor in birds."

In addition, we have tested in the rat several experimental conditions potentially susceptible to induce progesterone receptors. With the exception of chicken, tfm patients and possibly the frogs, progesterone receptors could not be conclusively demonstrated in any of the other animal species tested nor could they be induced in the rat. Surprisingly, they were not present in Stanley-Grumbeck pseudohermaphrodite rats. In chicken testes, the levels of progesterone receptor were variable (3--45 fmol per mg prot.) in the adults and high (87 fmol per mg prot.) in one-day-old animals. The presence of progesterone receptor, a marker of estradiol action in many estrogen-target tissues, seems to be parallel to the capacity of chicken testes for sex reversal under the influence of estrogens. In human tfm, the presence of these receptors could also indicate that the gonads are estrogen-sensitive or that they were so during embryonic life although the nature of estrogenic action is not known."

In case of formation of a testoid, the epoophoron develops into an epididymis and the rete ovarii develops into a rete testis which consists of intra- and extratesticular and intracapsular parts. Thus, a luminated duct system is developed which allows the transport of semen. In case of formation of an ovotestis, the discontinuously side-by-side located parts of the rete ovarii and of the epoophoron are maintained."
