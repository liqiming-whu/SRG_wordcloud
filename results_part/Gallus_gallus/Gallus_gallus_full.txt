Cytochrome P450 Family 19 SubFamily A member 1 (CYP19A1) gene encodes an aromatase which regulates the sexual differentiation in vertebrates by initiating and maintaining 17β-Estradiol (E2) synthesis. Here, we described the spatiotemporal expression pattern of CYP19A1 and its functional role in the embryonic gonad development in amphoteric chickens (Gallus gallus). Results showed that CYP19A1 exhibited a sexually dimorphic expression pattern in female gonads early at embryonic day 5.5 (HH 28) and robustly expressed within the cytoplasm in ovarian medullas. Most importantly, we induced the gonadal sex reversal by ectopically delivering the aromatase inhibitor (AI) or estradiol (E2) into chicken embryos. To further explore the role of CYP19A1 in chicken embryonic sexual differentiation, we successfully developed an effective method to deliver lentiviral particles with CYP19A1 manipulation into chicken embryos via embryonic intravascular injection. The analysis of interference and overexpression of CYP19A1 provided solid evidences that CYP19A1 is both necessary and sufficient to initiate sex differentiation toward female in chicken embryos. Collectively, this work demonstrates that CYP19A1 is a crucial sex differentiation gene in the embryonic development, which provides a foundation for understanding the mechanism of sex determination and differentiation in chickens.In mammals, the well-developed system for single-sex reproduction is based on the known sex-determination system [1,2]. In the dairy industry, most female cows are artificially inseminated with sorted semen to increase the number of female calves aiming to increase dairy milk production by creating an optimal ratio of male and female calves [3,4]. As egg-laying chickens need the female offspring while broiler chickens need males, the specific sex selection helps to reduce the cost and promote the poultry industry development [5]. However, there is still a big challenge to establish an effective sex-selection technology in birds due to the indistinct sex differentiation, causing more than half of poussins eliminated [6]. Therefore, it is essential to identify and characterize the function of critical sex differentiation genes for improving the single-sex reproduction.Cytochrome P450 Family 19 SubFamily A member 1 (CYP19A1), a vital enzyme for estrogen (17β-Estradiol, E2) synthesis in most vertebrates, modulates steroid hormones involved in the sex differentiation among amphibians, fishes, reptiles, birds and mammals [7–10]. In chickens, the manipulation of estrogen levels has been shown to induce the sex reversal [11,12]. Inhibition of estrogens by aromatase inhibitor (AI) may induce a permanent female-male sex reversal which was characterized by the formation of bilateral testis with the spermatogenesis ability and an external male phenotype [13]. In reverse, overexpression of CYP19A1 at the early growth stage of embryos may induce a male-female sex reversal which was characterized by an enlargement of the left gonad and the development of ovarian structure [14]. Moreover, estradiol plays a key role in the development and function of the oviduct by mobilizing calcium for eggshell formation and mediating secondary sexual characteristics [15]. Additionally, the exposure to exogenous estrogen induces feminization in genetically male embryos, but this effect is not permanent [16]. Taken together, aromatase and its product, estradiol, are critically important players involved in the sexual differentiation in chicken embryonic development.Even though CYP19A1 represents a hallmark of the sexual differentiation in chickens, the function of CYP19A1 in embryonic development has not been systematically reported. In the present study, we described the expression pattern of CYP19A1 and its functional role in chicken embryonic gonads development by mediating the estriol level via AI treatment and manipulating CYP19A1 using lentivirus-mediated RNAi and overexpressing systems. These data indicate that the CYP19A1 is a crucial sex differentiation gene in embryonic development providing insights in better understanding the mechanism of sex determination in chickens.All chicken eggs were collected from Rugao Yellow Chicken (Poultry Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, China). Eggs were incubated at 37°C and 75% relative humidity for 4.5 days (HH 25) and 18 days (HH 44), respectively.All experiments involving animals in the article were carried out at Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and incubated at the Laboratory of Yangzhou University. Other experiments were performed in the Laboratory of Yangzhou University. Chicken embryos at 4.5 days (HH 25) and 18 days (HH 44) were isolated from incubated eggs. In brief, embryos were exposed by knocking and opening the blunt of eggshell, taken out and placed into the Petri dishes containing PBS. Then, genital ridges or gonads were obtained by peeling off the embryonic membrane and tearing the skin of ventral side using forceps.PCR amplification was performed using Mighty Amp DNA Polymerase 2.0 (Takara, Dalian, China, R071A) and extracted cell or tissue samples were used as templates. Primers were designed based on the genomic sequence of chicken CHD1 gene on sex chromosomes (CHD1-Z, chrZ:51359549-51400046/CHD1-W, chrW: 4989932- 5105612, galGal6a, UCSC). The lengths of our amplified products using our primers for CHD1 are 580 bp (chrZ: 51387236-51387815) on Z chromosome and 434 bp (chrW: 5019696-5020129) on W chromosome. The sequences of CHD-Forward/Reward primers are as following:CHD-F: CTGCGAGAACGTGGCAACAGAGT;CHD-R: ATTGAAATGATCCAGTGCTTG.In a standard procedure, PCR was performed in a reaction system of 20 μl consisting of 2 μl sample, 10 μl of 2× Mighty Amp Buffer (TAKARA, Beijing, China, DR070), 0.4 μl Mighty Amp DNA Polymerase 2.0 (TAKARA, Beijing, China, DR070), 1 μl CHD-F primer (1 μM) and 1 μl CHD-R primer (1 μM). The condition of PCR was standardized at 98°C for 2 min followed by 30 reaction cycles at 98°C for 10 s, 60°C for 15 s and 68°C for 40 s. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis (2% in TBE) and visualized under UV light (Bio-Rad ChemiDoc™ Imaging System, Hercules, U.S.A.) after the Ethidium Bromide staining. Molecular size marker (DL5,000 DNA Marker; TAKARA, Dalian, China, 3428) was used to match the length of PCR products. The genetic sex of chicken embryos was identified by the size of bands: male (ZZ) with one band at 580 bp and female (ZW) with two bands at 580 and 423 bp.The concentration of sex hormone was measured using 17 β Estradiol ELISA Kit (Abcam, Cambridge, U.K., ab108667). Allantois fluid or blood samples were collected and concentrations of those samples were measured according to manufacturer’s instructions. Two hundred microliters of 17β estradiol–HRP conjugate was added to each well containing 25 μl standards, and control or experimental samples followed by the incubation for 2 h at 37°C. TMB substrate solution was added to each well after washing for three times using 300 μl diluted washing solution followed by a 30-min incubation at room temperature in the dark. One hundred microliter stop solution was added into each well in the same order and at the same rate as for the TMB substrate solution followed by the gentle shaking for 5 min. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured within 30 min after the addition of stop solution.Prior to the injection, AI (Letrozole, Solarbio Life Science, Beijing, China, IL0060) and E2 (17β-Estradiol, Solarbio Life Science, Beijing, China, IE0210) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Solarbio Life Science, Beijing, China, D8370) and diluted in 0.1 ml DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, U.S.A., 11965) with various doses (0.000, 0.025, 0.050, 0.075 and 0.100 mg).For chicken embryo injection, fertilized and freshly laid eggs were incubated for 2.5 days (HH 17) and then the eggshell was gently wiped off using sanitized cotton with 75% ethanol. A small window (<0.5 cm diameter, it is good to keep the window as small as possible) was made by using forceps sharpened at the broader edge (blunt end). Prepared AI or E2 solutions were injected into eggs under the air sac with 1-ml syringes. Holes were sealed with hot-melted paraffin or scotch tape followed by the egg incubation for 4.5 days (HH 25) or 18 days (HH 44).According to the coding region of chicken CYP19A1 gene (NCBI gene ID: 395783, accession: NM_001364699), three specific shRNAs targeting CYP19A1 were designed by Shanghai Gima Gene Corporation and then ligated into the pGMLV-SC5 vector carrying a gene encoding GFP. Similarly, CYP19A1-overexpressing plasmid was generated by inserting the coding sequence (CDS) of CYP19A1 into the pLV-OE vector containing the CDS of GFP. High-titer lentiviral particles (108 Tu/ml) carrying shRNAs targeting CYP19A1 or CYP19A1-overexpressing plasmid were generated in Lenti-X 293T packaging cells with packaging vectors (pLP1 and pLP2) and envelope vector (pLP/VSVG).After the incubation for 2.5 days (HH 17), a small window (<1 cm diameter) was made using forceps sharpened at the broader edge (blunt end) to expose chicken embryos. Five microliters of lentiviral solution was injected into the upper portion of the dorsal aorta of the recipient embryo using mouth pipette; 400–600 μl of penicillin–streptomycin solution was dropped on the top of embryos which were further incubated until 4.5 days (HH 25) and 18 days (HH 44) after sealing the window using scotch tapes. The efficiency of virus infection was determined by measuring the intensity of GFP using a stereo-fluorescence microscope (MVX10, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Gonads or gonad–middle–renal complexes were isolated from embryos at different stages for RNA extraction and histomorphological analysis.Total RNA from collected tissues was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, U.S.A., 15596-026). cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg total RNA using RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (MBI/Fermentas, Lithuania, K1621) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time PCR was performed using SuperReal PreMix Plus (SYBR Green) (TIANGEN, Beijing, China, FP205). Gene expression levels were presented as relative values. All the experiments were performed in triplicate. The sequences of quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) primers were listed in Supplementary Table S1.The removed embryonic gonads were stored in 4% paraformaldehyde, fixed for 24 h and then transferred to 50% ethanol. The tissue shape was corrected and photographed under a stereo-microscope (MVX10, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). After the ethanol concentration was dehydrated from low to high gradient, xylene was transparent, paraffin was embedded and conventional paraffin section was cut with a thickness of 5–6 μm. Sections were dewaxed with xylene and rehydrated using ethanol with gradient concentration from high to low followed by Hematoxylin–Eosin staining, dehydration and mounting slides. Sections were visualized using the microscope (Eclipse 80i, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).After dewaxing with xylene, slides were infiltrated through ethanol from high to low concentrations and then placed into a 0.01 mol/l sodium citrate solution. After repairing the antigen at 95°C for 20 min, slides were cooled to room temperature and incubated with blocking buffer (10% normal donkey serum, 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton X-100) at room temperature for 1 h. Then slides were stained with anti-SOX9 antibody (1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, U.K., ab3697) or anti-aromatase antibody (1:250, Abcam, Cambridge, U.K., ab139492) overnight at 4°C. After three washes using phosphate Triton X-100 buffer (PBST) for 10 min each time, slides were stained with sheep anti-rabbit IgG-488 (1:250, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, U.S.A., 11203D) or goat anti-mouse IgG H&L (DyLight® 594) (1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, U.K., ab96873) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark followed by three PBST washes. DAPI (286 nmol/l, Sigma, St. Louis, U.S.A., D9542) was used to stain the nucleus at room temperature for 5 min in the dark. Following three PBST washes, slides were mounted with anti-fluorescence quenching solution and visualized using a confocal fluorescence microscope (A1 Plus, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).In order to determine the expression patterns of CYP19A1 (aromatase) in chicken (Gallus gallus) embryonic development, the spatiotemporal expression of CYP19A1 was evaluated by qPCR. The results showed that the CYP19A1 transcript was significantly highly expressed in female gonads throughout the period of sex determination to born, from as early as day 5.5 (HH 28) to the day 21.5 (born), but barely expressed in male gonad (Figure 1A). Moreover, CYP19A1 was localized in the medulla cells in the early ovary, by contrast, the signal was not detectable in early testis (Figure 1B). These data reveal that the sexually dimorphic expression pattern of CYP19A1 and differed in chicken early ovary, imply CYP19A1 involved in ovary development in chicken (Gallus gallus), as in other species [17,18].(A) The mRNA expression of CYP19A1 in embryos (days 0–2.5, HH 0–17) and gonads of different stages (days 2.5–21.5, HH 17–48), determined by qRT-PCR analysis; β-actin was used as a reference gene. (B) Immunofluorescence detection of CYP19A1 protein in the gonad at day 18.5 in female and male. CYP19A1 protein was localized in the cytoplasm of the medulla of the female gonad (ovary, day 18.5, HH 44). Co, cortex; Me, medulla; St, seminiferous tubule. Scale bar: 10 μm (data were shown as mean ± SEM and Student’s t test was utilized for statistical analysis.**P<0.01).Previous studies demonstrated that AI led to inhibit the CYP19A1 expression and decrease in estradiol [10]. We examined the genetic sex by PCR (Supplementary Figure S1A) and used different concentrations of AI (Aromatase Inhibitor, Letozole) and estradiol (E2, estradiol) to treat day 2.5 (HH 17) chicken embryos to sync the level of the estradiol (Figure 2A). To investigate the sex of chicken embryo-sex transformation after the treatment, we developed a method by morphology based on the length of the gonads on both sides of the normally developing male (ZZ) chicken embryos which was similar and the female (ZW) left gonads that were larger and the right gonads smaller. We determined that the gonad area ratio (left/right) was 1.21 + 0.23 for male, and 2.75 + 0.44 for female (Supplementary Figure S1B,C). Compared with the PCR and morphological results, the gradually elevated E2 induced the increased proportion of female and AI was the opposite (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S1D). The masculinization in female gonads after AI treatment, the cortex thinning (red dot line) and spermatic cord (green arrow) appeared in the female left gonad. In contrast, feminization in male gonads after E2 showed the female structure (spermatic cord disappeared and cortex thickened) (Figure 2C). With the reversal of the sex of the gonads, the expression of the sex marker genes in the gonads also reversed. Specifically, the expression of Sox9 in AI-treated ZW gonads gradually increased and the expression of Foxl2 decreased. The E2 treatment in ZZ gradually increased the Sox9 and decreased the Foxl2 (Figure 2D). These observations indicate that CYP19A1 is a vital factor for the induction of embryonic gonad development in chicken.(A) The concentration of Estradiol in different treatments. (B) The ratio of PCR and visual results in different treatment groups. (C) The histology of E18.5 gonads in different treatments (the red dot line separates the cortex and medulla; the green arrow points the spermatic cord). Scale bar: 50 μm. (D) The Sox9 and Foxl2 expression in different treatments (data were shown as mean ± SEM and Student’s t test was utilized for statistical analysis. *P<0.05, **P<0.01).To solve the problem of the lack of available genetic manipulation techniques in chicken and verify the effect, we established an efficient gene-modulating method for functional analysis in ovo. We developed lentiviral vectors carrying CYP19A1-specific shRNAs with a GFP reporter gene to knockdown and encode the CDSs for overexpression of the endogenous CYP19A1 transcripts and verify the vector activity in DF-1 cells (Figure 3A–C). To test the activity of this virus system in ovo, the expression of EGFP was detected in embryos at day 4.5 (HH 25) of development, indicating that the virus is efficient (Figure 3D). Quantitative results showed that the expression of CYP19A1 decreased significantly after treatment with CYP19A1 interference in female and male chicken gonads, while overexpression induces the increase in CYP19A1 (Figure 3E). These results indicate that we successfully developed an effective gene up- and down-modulating method in chicken that works both in vitro and in ovo.(A) Schematic diagram of CYP19A1 target sites of RNAi and CDS.

(E) The expression of CYP19A1 in gonad different groups (data were shown as mean ± SEM and Student’s t test were utilized for statistical analysis. *P<0.05, **P<0.01).To verify the function of CYP19A1 in the process of gonad differentiation in chicken embryos, we infected the scrambled virus overexpression or interference to the chicken embryo by vessel injection method and compared phenotype and marker gene expression by gonadal histology, immunofluorescence and qRT-PCR at day 18.5 (HH 44). We examined the effects of CYP19A1 overexpression and interference on embryonic estradiol. qRT-PCR results showed that the overexpression of CYP19A1 causes up-regulation of estradiol in both females and males, and interference will reduce the concentration of estradiol (Figure 4A). It is demonstrated that the CYP19A1 regulates estradiol synthesis during embryonic development. In addition, the sex phenotype is also transformed with the overexpression and interference of CYP19A1, more female embryos were observed in CYP19A1 overexpression and more male in CYP19A1 interference (Figure 4B). Compared with the normal male gonads (ZZ), the left swollen gonad appeared after overexpressing CYP19A1 in male. The section results further indicate that early spermatic cord disappeared and cortex thickened. Reversed after interfering with CYP19A1 in female chicken embryos, no significant difference in the size of the two gonads was similar to the morphology of the male gonads. The section results showed that the female chicken embryonic gonads exhibited cortex thinning (red dot line) and spermatic cord (green arrow) appeared in the female left gonad after interfering with CYP19A1 (Figure 4C and Supplementary Figure S2). The results of immunofluorescence showed that overexpression of CYP19A1 inhibits the expression of Sox9, while interference could promote the expression of Sox9 in the gonads (Figure 4D). Moreover, the results of qRT-PCR also showed that Sox9 was highly expressed in control males and female with CYP19A1 interfering and the Foxl2 was highly expressed in control female and male with CYP19A1 overexpression (Figure 4E). These results indicate that CYP19A1 plays a critical role in chicken sexual differentiation, overexpression of CYP19A1 promote the differentiation of female gonads, while interference promotes the differentiation of male gonads.(A) The concentration of estradiol in different groups.

Here, we demonstrate that CYP19A1 acts as a female sex differentiation gene in chicken and showed that CYP19A1 has sexually dimorphic expression pattern and high expression in the medulla of female embryonic gonad (day 18.5, HH 44). Most importantly, we provided solid functional evidence that CYP19A1 is both necessary and sufficient to initiate female development in chicken (Gallus gallus) embryonic via a novel in ovo viral transduction system and treatment of AI/Estradiol. This is the first integrity and systematic research of the function characterization of CYP19A1 (Aromatase) in sexual differentiation in chicken (Gallus gallus) embryonic development (Figure 5).It has been demonstrated that the sexual differentiation in birds is quite different from that in mammals, which have symmetrical ovarian development. However, birds lose the right ovary and oviduct in the sexual development [19]. In chicken embryos, male and female gonads are morphologically indistinguishable in appearance in day 5.5 (HH 28) [12]. We found that CYP19A1 also exhibited early female-specific embryonic expression before the onset of gonadal sex differentiation in the chicken embryos and express the medulla cells of ovary. These results consistent with previous findings demonstrate that the CYP19A1 is female-specific and expresses in early gonads from the time of gonadal sex differentiation in chicken [20–23]. These features of CYP19A1 expression suggest that it is important for both primary sex differentiation and subsequent gonadal differentiation in chicken.Gonadal steroid hormones are crucial for sexual differentiation of endocrine components of reproduction [24]. In birds, estradiol appears to be critical in the sexual differentiation of females [25]. The current study shows that the manipulation of estradiol levels in the early chicken embryo induces the female-to-male or male-to-female sex reversal [26]. The exogenous estradiol and its synthetase aromatase can override the genetic effect if applied during the sex differentiation [27]. In this study, we developed a method to identify the phenotype of embryonic sex and demonstrate the effect of AI and Estradiol (E2) on embryonic gonad development. Moreover, in lizard and Brazilian turtle embryos, the estradiol and AIs induced sex reversion [28]. In Xenopus laevis, the exogenous AIs induce female gonads to develop male traits [29,30]. However, in mammals, injection of estradiol or estradiol inhibitors does not promote permanent sexual reversal and once the injection of hormones or inhibitors is stopped, the sex phenotype will still return to its original [31,32]. This suggests that the effects of sex hormones may not be as important in Genetic-Sex-Determined (GSD) animals as in Environment-Sex-Determined (ESD) animals. The dose-dependent AIs that induce the sex phenotype reversal in adult chicken also have been identified. Our results showed that although the chicken sex determination is GSD but the hormones conduce permanent sex reserved. The dose-dependency on hormones in chicken confirm that the chicken sex differentiation and maintenance were involved by hormones and different from mammals, but similar to reptiles.We developed a viral vector for overexpression and interference in ovo, which upon injection into vascellum of day 2.5 (HH 17) embryos allow for embryo-wide infection and transgene expression. The immunofluorescence performed the vector infection and qRT-PCR showed increased or decreased levels of CYP19A1 expression, indicating the validity of this viral system. The data presented here clearly showed that CYP19A1 is a strong master gene in chicken female gonadal differentiation, and independently initiate male gonadal differentiation to female, while female gonadal differentiation into male with the expression suppressed. Moreover, CYP19A1 affects the expression of sex downstream gene Sox9 and Foxl2, suggesting that CYP19A1 is a key factor that direction differentiation of embryonic sex development in chicken. In Xenopus laevis, knockout of CYP19A1 induce the whole-male offspring, which indicate the CYP19A1 is a key regulator of zebrafish female sexual gonads differentiation [33]. In the Pelodiscus sinensis, the overexpression and interference of CYP19A1 lead to the sex reversal [34]. The overexpression of CYP19A1 induce the ovarian development in males [14]. These data suggest that the CYP19A1 as a regulator may be highly conserved in the early ovarian differentiation in non-mammalian vertebrates.Although the importance of CYP19A1 in maintaining female gonadal development has been well documented, the present study systematically performed that CYP19A1 overexpression or interference can affect gonad phenotype in chicken. This work therefore not only builds the foundation for related research on chicken sex differentiation and mechanism, but also establishes an effective sex reversal model (interference or overexpression of hormones and CYP19A1), which provides a new opportunity for poultry production. It is a potential to obtain all-male offspring in broiler chicken production by mating between CYP19A1 interference individual male with males.The authors declare that there are no competing interests associated with the manuscript.This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 31772582, 31972547]; the Key Research and Development Program [grant number 2017YFE0108000]; the High Level Talents Support Program of Yangzhou University, Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province [grant number KYCX18_2376]; the Jiangsu Science and Technology Project (Youth Fund) [grant number BK20180918]; and the Natural Science Research Project of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions [grant number 18KJB230008].Bichun Li, Guohong Chen, and Yani Zhang designed the study.

In the present study, a genome-wide analysis identified the numbers of β-hsd genes in orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) (19), human (Homo sapiens) (22), mouse (Mus musculus) (24), chicken (Gallus gallus) (16), xenopus (Xenopus tropicalis) (24), coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) (17), spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) (14), zebrafish (Danio rerio) (19), fugu (Takifugu rubripes) (19), tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) (19), medaka (Oryzias latipes) (19), stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) (17) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) (27) samples. A comparative analysis revealed that the number of β-hsd genes in teleost fish was no greater than in tetrapods due to gene loss followed by a teleost-specific whole-genome duplication event. Based on transcriptome data from grouper brain and gonad samples during sex reversal, six β-hsd genes had relatively high expression levels in the brain, indicating that these genes may be required for neurogenesis or the maintenance of specific biological processes in the brain. In the gonad, two and eight β-hsd genes were up- and downregulated, respectively, indicating their important roles in sex reversal. Our results demonstrated that β-hsd genes may be involved in the sex reversal of grouper by regulating the synthesis and metabolism of sex steroid hormones.In almost all vertebrates, sexual reproduction requires both females and males to maintain survival and variation. Therefore, sex determination and differentiation are important processes for the continuation of species (Kobayashi et al., 2013). The orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) is a protogynous hermaphrodite species. The gonads of most groupers develop into ovaries during the first sex differentiation; however, the ovaries of some individuals then change to testis after female sexual maturation is complete in a process known as sex reversal (Liu and de Mitcheson, 2009). Gonadal changes in sex-changing fish are accompanied by changes in plasma levels of sex steroids (Godwin, 2010), and the balance between estrogen and androgen controls the direction of gonadal development during sex reversal (Liu et al., 2017).All classes of steroid hormones are synthesized from the common precursor cholesterol. The synthesis of sex steroid hormones is carried out under the catalysis of a series of enzymes, and the genes encoding these enzymes include hsd3b1, hsd11b2, hsd17b1, hsd17b3, and hsd20b2 of the beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (β-HSDs) superfamily, and cyp11a1, cyp11b, cyp17a1, cyp19a1a, and cyp21a1 of the cytochrome P450 (cP450) superfamily (Tokarz et al., 2015). Hsd3b1 is responsible for the oxidation and isomerization of Δ5-3β-hydroxysteroid precursors in order to form Δ4-3-ketosteroid (Nakamoto et al., 2012). Hsd11b2 catalyzes the conversion of cortisol to cortisone (Fuller et al., 2012), and also plays a crucial role in the conversion of 11β-OH-androstenedione to 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) (Tokarz et al., 2015), which affects the production of the most important androgen in teleost fish. Furthermore Hsd17b1 converts inactive estrone to active estradiol (Mindnich et al., 2004), Hsd17b3 is an essential enzyme for the synthesis of 11-KT (Mindnich et al., 2005) and Hsd20b2 converts 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone to 17alpha,20beta-DP, which has been identified as the maturation-inducing hormone of several teleosts (Senthilkumaran et al., 2002).HSDs catalyze the conversion of a hydroxy group to a keto group or vice versa on a steroid ring in a specific position and orientation (Yang et al., 2005). Different types of β-HSDs are found in various tissues including brain and gonad (He et al., 2018), and most belong to the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, except for HSD17B5, which belongs to the structural family of aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) (Day et al., 2008). To the best of our knowledge, systematic identification of the SDR and HSD gene families has only been performed in plants (Moummou et al., 2012) and bacteria (Kisiela et al., 2012), respectively. In addition, functional studies of β-hsd genes have mainly utilized human, mouse and zebrafish model organisms, while little is known about their expression and function in other species.Orange-spotted grouper is an important marine fish cultured in China and Southeast Asian countries. Recently, sequencing and assembly of the grouper genome, and RNA-sequencing of the brain and gonad of grouper during sex reversal were completed (unpublished data), making it a good model for genome-wide identification and gonadal expression profiling of β-hsd genes.Here we report the genome-wide identification of β-hsd genes in grouper, human (Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus), chicken (Gallus gallus), xenopus (Xenopus tropicalis), coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae), spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus), zebrafish (Danio rerio), fugu (Takifugu rubripes), tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), medaka (Oryzias latipes), stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Furthermore, RNA-seq data was used to analyze the expression of β-hsd genes during the sex reversal of grouper. Our study may provide a greater understanding of the evolution and possible functions of β-hsd genes in teleosts.All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines and approval of the Animal Research and Ethics Committees of Sun Yat-sen University. Grouper were cultivated in the Marine Fisheries Development Center of Guangdong Province. In April 2015, 100 groupers weighing approximately 5 kg were sacrificed for tissue sampling after being anesthetized by MS222. For each fish, the gonad and brain were taken and stored at −80°C for RNA extraction, and a piece of gonadal tissue was fixed in Bouin’s fluid for histological examination.Histological examination was performed as described previously (Xiao et al., 2018). Each gonad was assigned to one of five periods based on the gonadal morphology previously reported (Liu and de Mitcheson, 2009): ovarian-phase-2 (Ov2), ovarian-phase-3 (Ov3), ovarian-phase-4 (Ov4), bisexual-phase (Bi) and testis (Te). Ov2 gonad was predominated by primary-growth stage oocytes, Ov3 gonad was accompanied by the development of cortical-alveolus stage oocytes, and the appearance of vitellogenic stage oocytes indicated that the ovary had matured and belonged to Ov4. During the sex reversal of grouper, spermatogenic cysts and primary-growth stage oocytes are present in the bisexual-phase gonad simultaneously. The oocyte completely disappears and the gonad is filled with male germ cells, indicating that the sex reversal has been completed and the gonad has changed to testis.The genome sequences and predicted protein sequences of human1, mouse2, chicken3, xenopus4, coelacanth5, spotted gar6, zebrafish7, fugu8, tilapia9, medaka10, and stickleback11 were downloaded from Ensembl, and the sequences of the common carp were downloaded from NCBI12. The genomic sequence of grouper has been recently sequenced, with 1.03 GB of genomic data assembled and 23043 encoded genes predicted, of which 23,013 genes could be annotated (PRJEB28248 in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive site).To identify candidate β-hsd genes in these thirteen species, we collected the gene and protein names of the β-hsd gene family from the literature (Payne et al., 1997; Dai et al., 2003; Mindnich et al., 2004; Seckl, 2004; Hoffmann and Maser, 2007; Meier et al., 2009; Mindnich and Adamski, 2009; Sreenivasulu and Senthilkumaran, 2009; Rotinen et al., 2010; Kisiela et al., 2012; Saloniemi et al., 2012; Tokarz et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2013; He et al., 2018). Secondly, the amino acid sequences of human and zebrafish β-hsd genes were collected from Ensembl and GenBank by searching for their gene and protein names. Next, specific hidden Markov models (HMMs) of human and zebrafish β-HSDs were developed by hmmbuild command in HMMER (HMMER3.1B213) and then used as the query sequences to search the protein databases of all the studied species with hmmsearch command in HMMER (E-value = 0.01). Because all the β-hsd genes belong to the SDR family, except for hsd17b5, which belongs to the AKR superfamily, there was concern that the HMMs-based search would miss hsd17b5. Therefore, the amino acid sequence of human HSD17B5 was used as query sequence to search the protein databases of other species by local BLASTP with a cut off E-value of 1e-5 (BLAST 2.2.26 release from NCBI by anonymous FTP14) (Altschul et al., 1997). All the suspected sequences were aligned with the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence database by online BLASTP program to obtain reliable sequences of β-hsd genes.To explore the structural diversity of the β-HSD family, the 19 grouper β-HSD protein sequences were submitted to the online CD-Search in CDD program15 (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2017) to search for functional domains (E-value = 0.01). In addition, the online tool GSDS 2.016 (Hu et al., 2015) was used to display the gene structure and functional domains of grouper β-hsd genes.Multiple alignment of the amino acid sequences of all β-HSDs from six species including grouper, human, mouse, zebrafish, tilapia, and stickleback was performed using ClustalX-2.1 program (Jeanmougin et al., 1998). The maximum likelihood tree and neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees were constructed using the MEGA7 program (Kumar et al., 2016).Brain and gonad tissue from two fish in each stage were selected for transcriptome sequencing. RNA extraction and detection, library construction, sequencing, gene expression calculation and differential gene expression analyses were performed as previously described (Xiao et al., 2018). These RNA-seq data (PRJNA564153 in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive site) were used to analyze the β-hsd gene expression profiles during sex reversal. The expression of β-hsd genes was shown using R packages (i386 3.4.0). The RPKM values were transformed into Z scores before drawing heatmap. Z scores were plotted according to Z = (x - μ)/σ, where x is the log2 transformed gene expression measurement and μ and σ are the mean and standard deviations of expression of the gene.To examine the reliability of RNA-seq results, 10 β-hsd genes were selected for validation using qRT-PCR. Because there were only four bisexual-phase fish among the 100 sacrificed individuals, four fish were used for qRT-PCR in each period. Total RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed using TRIzolTM reagent (Invitrogen, United States) and a Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche, United States), respectively. Specific primers (Supplementary Table S3) were designed by Primer Premier 6 software. β-actin was chosen to be the housekeeping gene for its stable expression in brain and gonad tissue during sex reversal. The qRT-PCR reactions based on SYBR (LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master, Roche, United States) were performed with a LightCycler 480 system (Roche, United States). Relative expression levels were calculated using the 2–△ △ Ct method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). Analysis and visualization of quantitative results was performed by GraphPad Prism 6.0, and one-way ANOVA statistical analysis was used in the analysis.A total of 22 and 19 β-hsd genes were collected from the human and zebrafish genome, respectively, which were used to construct HMM models. A set of 19 putative members of the β-hsd genes have been identified from the orange-spotted grouper genome (Table 1). Among the 19 β-hsd genes, a total of 14 were distributed across 10 linkage groups (LGs) in the grouper genome (Figure 1). In addition, we also identified 24, 16, 24, 17, 14, 19, 19, 19, 17, and 27 β-hsd genes in mouse, chicken, xenopus, coelacanth, spotted gar, fugu, tilapia, medaka, stickleback, and common carp, respectively (Table 1). The gene and protein IDs of the β-hsd genes of all species are listed in the attached table (Supplementary Table S1).Table 1. Number variation of β-hsd genes in the orange-spotted grouper and the other surveyed animals.Figure 1. Chromosome localization of 19 β-hsd genes from orange-spotted grouper.The exon-intron structure of the grouper β-hsd genes was further characterized, and showed that the number of introns in each β-hsd gene varied from 2–16 (Figure 2B). Hsd3b1 was the gene with the lowest number of introns, containing only two, while hsd17b4 had the greatest amount at 16. In addition, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the grouper β-HSD protein sequences to determine whether the exon-intron structure is consistent with the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2A). As expected, several genes with similar exon/intron structures were clustered together on the phylogenetic tree, such as hsd17b7/hsd17b7l, hsd20b2/hsd17b12a/hsd17b12b. However, due to large number of exon/intron structure types of the grouper β-hsd genes, only a few genes shared similar structures.Figure 2. Phylogenetic analysis, gene structure and conserved domains of β-hsd genes in orange-spotted grouper. (A) The phylogenetic tree of all β-Hsd in grouper was constructed using Neighbor-Joining method. (B) The exon/intron organization of β-hsd genes of grouper. The red boxes represent exons and black lines indicate introns. (C) The conserved protein domains in the β-Hsd were identified using CD-Search program. Each domain is indicated with a specific color. Yellow: NADB_Rossmann superfamily, green: PLN02864 superfamily, purple: SCP2 superfamily, blue: SDR superfamily.The functional domains of grouper β-HSD were predicted by the CD-Search (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2017) based on their protein sequences (Figure 2C). As shown in Figure 2C, 18 of the 19 grouper β-HSDs possessed an SDR superfamily domain, except Hsdl2, indicating a high level of conservation of β-hsd genes belonging to the SDR superfamily. In addition to the SDR superfamily domain, Hsd17b4 also contained two other domains: PLN02864 superfamily domain and SCP2 superfamily domain. Notably, Hsdl2 was a member of the SDR superfamily, but no SDR superfamily domain existed in grouper Hsdl2, according to the CDD prediction. Therefore, we also predicted the functional domain of Hsdl2 protein sequences of other species by CD-Search (Supplementary Figure S1). As shown in Supplementary Figure S1, six Hsdl2 protein sequences contained the SDR superfamily domain and did not contain the NADB_Rossmann superfamily domain, while the other eight Hsdl2 protein sequences, including grouper Hsdl2, were the opposite.To clarify the evolutionary relationships among β-hsd genes, a phylogenetic tree was constructed with amino acid sequences of 96 β-HSDs collected from grouper, human, zebrafish, stickleback, and tilapia. Both maximum likelihood (ML, Figure 3) and Neighboring-Joining method (NJ, Supplementary Figure S2) strategies were devoted to construct phylogenetic trees based on the alignment of their amino acid sequences. The trees produced by these two methods differed only in a small number of branches, indicating that the evolutionary tree is credible.Figure 3. Phylogenetic relationships of β-Hsd proteins from grouper and other five species. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA7 by Maximum Likelihood method with the amino acid sequences of β-Hsd from grouper (Epinephelus coioides, Ec), (Homo sapiens, Hs), mouse (Mus musculus, Mm), zebrafish (Danio rerio, Dr), tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus, On), and stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus, Ga).We used transcriptome data of grouper brains and gonads at five developmental stages, namely Ov2(ovarian-phase-2), Ov3(ovarian-phase-3), Ov4(ovarian-phase-4), Bi(bisexual-phase) and Te(testis), to profile the expression of β-hsd genes during sex reversal of grouper. By transcriptomic analysis, 18 of the 19 β-hsd genes were detected in the brains and gonads during sex reversal, except for hsd17b2 (Supplementary Table S2). According to the criteria that a gene is considered to be expressed if it exhibits an expression level with RPKM value ≥2, we found that except for hsd11b1l, hsd17b9, and hsd20b2, the other 15 β-hsd genes were expressed in the brains or gonads in at least one development stage (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table S2). Among these expressed β-hsd genes, eleven members (hsd3b1, hsd17b1, hsd17b4, hsd17b7l, hsd17b8, hsd17b10, hsdl17b12a, hsd17b12b, hsd17b14, hsdl1, and hsdl2) and six members (hsd11b2, hsd17b3, hsd17b10, hsd17b12b, hsdl1, and hsdl2) presented high expression (RPKM value ≥10) in gonads and brain in at least one developmental stage, respectively. As shown in Figure 4, the expression levels of eight β-hsd genes (hsd3b7, hsd17b1, hsd17b7l, hsd17b10, hsd17b12a, hsd17b12b, hsdl1, and hsdl2) were reduced, while two β-hsd genes (hsd3b1 and hsd17b14) were up-regulated in the gonad during sex reversal.Figure 4. Clustering of the expression profiles of 19 grouper β-hsd genes during sex reversal. Genes were clustered according to phylogenetic relationships in expression profiles. The RPKM values were transformed into Z scores. Z scores were plotted according to Z = (x - μ)/σ, where x is the log 2 transformed gene expression measurement and μ and σ are the mean and standard deviations of expression of the gene. Red and blue colors indicate high and low relative expression levels after homogenization, respectively. The RPKM value for each gene and each stage was provided in the figure.To further verify the expression levels of β-hsd genes during sex reversal of grouper, qRT-PCR validation experiments were conducted using gene-specific primers (Supplementary Table S3). The four genes involved in the synthesis of sex steroid hormones (hsd3b1, hsd11b2, hsd17b3, and hsd20b2) and eight genes with RPKM value ≥20 (a total of ten genes after de-duplication) were selected for qRT-PCR validation. Expression patterns during sex reversal of these 10 genes were shown to be consistent with transcriptome data (Figures 4, 5 and Supplementary Table S2).Figure 5. Quantitative RT-PCR examination of 10 β-hsd genes expressions in the brain and gonad during sex reversal of grouper. Values represent the relative mRNA expression in relation to internal control (β-actin gene). Data were expressed as the mean ± SEM for four replicates. In each panel, different lowercase letters indicate significant differences (p < 0.05).HSDs are a group of steroidogenic enzymes that are involved in steroid biosynthesis and metabolism (Ye et al., 2014). To the best of our knowledge, HSD gene repertoires have previously been described in bacteria (Kisiela et al., 2012), plants (Moummou et al., 2012), zebrafish (Mindnich et al., 2004; Mindnich and Adamski, 2009) and several mammals (Payne et al., 1997; Baker, 2001; Belyaeva and Kedishvili, 2006; Rotinen et al., 2010), but no studies have summarized all the β-hsd genes. Little is known about the corresponding grouper genes; however, the availability of the complete grouper genome sequence has made it possible to identify all the β-hsd genes in this species for the first time. In the present study, we systematically idntified 19 putative β-hsd genes in the E. coioides genome, and subsequently characterized the genes in terms of position in the genome, exon-intron structure and conserved domains. In addition, we also isolated β-hsd genes in samples of human, mouse, chicken, xenopus, coelacanth, spotted gar, zebrafish, fugu, tilapia, medaka, stickleback, and common carp. Finally, an analysis of grouper β-hsd gene expression levels during sex reversal indicated that these genes may play important roles in this significant physiological process. Our study represented the first comprehensive investigation of the fish β-hsd gene family, and the resulting data will undoubtedly be useful for future analyses, including further research into the role of β-hsd genes and sex steroids in sex reversal of grouper.Comparative analysis revealed several evolutionary phenomena of the β-hsd genes during the separation of fish species from other animals. First, unlike some other gene families which have undergone an expansion in the teleost fish, the number of β-hsd genes in teleost fish was no greater than in tetrapods. Studies have reported after two major radiations of jawed vertebrate, teleosts shared another round of whole-genome duplication events (the 3R WGD) (Kasahara et al., 2007), and common carp underwent an additional whole-genome duplication event (the 4R WGD) (Xu et al., 2014). For the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily, 48, 75, and 137 members have been reported in human, tilapia and common carp, respectively, suggesting that NRs may have expanded along with multiple duplication events (Cheng et al., 2015). The sox gene family has also undergone a continuous expansion in the teleost fish following their whole genome duplication (Wei et al., 2016). However, for the β-hsd genes, expansion after the 3R WGD and the 4R WGD was not as obvious as in the NR gene family and sox gene family. For example, hsd3b1 and hsd17b4 had only one copy in all species, and hsd17b3, hsdl1, and hsdl2 had two copies in common carp which had undergone the 4R WGD, and only one copy in other species. Such a phenomenon is considered to be a result of gene loss followed by the WGD. The duplication-degeneration-complementation (DDC) model proposed by Lynch and Conery (2000) on the fate of duplicated genes suggested that the common fate of a duplicated gene was lost from the genome owing to non-functionalization unless one of the duplicate genes acquired a new function, or the functions of the ancestral gene are sub-divided between the sister duplicate genes. Gene loss was thought to be a mechanism to maintain a balance for duplicated genes post genome duplication events. Gene loss is evident in the β-hsd gene family, but not so obvious in the NR and sox gene families, which may be due to different selective pressures or different evolutionary rates among different gene catalogs. Secondly, several genes were identified only in a particular species. For instance, among all the species we studied, Hsd3b3, Hsd3b4, Hsd3b5, and Hsd3b6 were specifically identified in the mouse genome. The six mouse Hsd3b genes (MnHsd3b1, MnHsd3b2 and four mouse-specific Hsd3b genes) were located in a small region (98499071-98859794) of chromosome 3 and clustered together in the phylogenetic tree, seemingly suggesting that the four mouse-specific Hsd3b genes were more likely a product of mouse-specific gene duplication rather than gene loss in other species. In addition, hsd20b2 was not identified in tetrapod genomes, apparently indicating that hsd20b2 may be lost in the tetrapod genome but retained in the teleost genome following their divergence.The orange-spotted grouper is a typical protogynous hermaphrodite species. Previous studies have shown that groupers in the natural environment generally develop into female individuals during the first sex differentiation (Liu and de Mitcheson, 2009). Then the sex reversal from female to male occur in a small part of mature/functional females, while the males retain the same sex throughout their life span (Bhandari et al., 2003). Sex steroids play a very important role in sex reversal of groupers. Low serum E2 levels and increased 11-KT levels are probably the events mediating protogynous sex change in grouper (Bhandari et al., 2003). In addition, exogenous androgens could artificially induce the sex reversal of groupers from female to male (Chen et al., 2011; Oh et al., 2013; Murata et al., 2014). However, little is known about the expression profiles of sex steroid synthesis and metabolism genes in the natural sex reversal process. HSDs participate in the synthesis and metabolism of sex steroid hormones by catalyzing the conversion of a hydroxy group to a keto group or vice versa on a steroid ring in a specific position and orientation (Yang et al., 2005). Studies on the expression profiles of hsd genes at different stages of grouper sex reversal may provide us a better understanding on the roles of hsd genes in sex reversal.The transcriptome data indicated that six (hsd11b2, hsd17b3, hsd17b10, hsd17b12b, hsdl1, and hsdl2) and eleven (hsd3b1, hsd17b1, hsd17b4, hsd17b7l, hsd17b8, hsd17b10, hsdl17b12a, hsd17b12b, hsd17b14, hsdl1, and hsdl2) β-HSD genes had relatively high expression levels (RPKM >10) in the brain and gonad during sex reversal of grouper, respectively. HSDs are indispensable neuro-steroidogenic enzymes, and the neuro-steroids synthesized in neurons and glia can act on various receptors to regulate neuroexcitability while also playing important roles in brain development, neuroprotection and neurogenesis as well as cognition and memory (He et al., 2018). For example, human HSD17B10 is found in various brain regions and is essential for the maintenance of neurosteroid homeostasis (He et al., 2018); and Hsd11b2 is involved in the negative feedback regulation of cortisol post stress in the brain of zebrafish (Alderman and Vijayan, 2012). In grouper, transcriptome data has shown that the expression levels of six β-hsd genes highly expressed in the brain did not change significantly during sexual reversal, seemingly indicating that these genes may be required for neurogenesis or the maintenance of specific biological processes in the brain, but not for sex reversal events.In the gonad, two (hsd3b1 and hsd17b14) and eight (hsd3b7, hsd17b1, hsd17b7l, hsd17b10, hsd17b12a, hsd17b12b, hsdl1, and hsdl2) β-HSD genes were up- and downregulated during sex reversal, respectively. Hsd3b1 catalyzes the second step of steroidogenesis and is required for the synthesis of all steroids including 11-KT (Hsu et al., 2009). In human testis specimens, HSD17B14 protein has shown immunoreactivity in most of the seminiferous epithelium as well as in peritubular areas harboring Leydig cells (Sivik et al., 2012). Transfection of HSD17B14 in human breast cancer cells significantly decreased the levels of estradiol (Jansson et al., 2006), and further studies have suggested a role for HSD17B14 in the local inactivation of steroid (Lukacik et al., 2007). Therefore, we hypothesized that the increased expression levels of hsd3b1 during the sex reversal of grouper may promote the synthesis of 11-KT, while the increased expression level of hsd17b14 may lead to the inactivation of estradiol in this study.HSD17B1 is mainly expressed in the ovary (Mindnich and Adamski, 2009), and catalyzes lower estrogenic active estrone (E1) to highly active estradiol (E2) (Hakkarainen et al., 2015; Jarvensivu et al., 2015). HSD17B12 has been implicated in the conversion of estrone to estradiol as well as in the synthesis of arachidonic acid (AA), and plays important roles in ovarian function and female fertility (Kemilainen et al., 2016). Accordingly, we propose that the high expression levels of hsd17b1, hsd17b12a and hsd17b 12b in the ovary may be due to its involvement in the maintenance of the ovary, and the degeneration of ovary leads to the downregulation of these genes during the sex reversal grouper. The 3-beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-C(27)-steroid oxidoreductase, which is encoded by HSD3B7 gene, is a membrane-bound enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum that catalyzes an early step in the synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol, and mutation of the HSD3B7 gene causes neonatal cholestasis (Cheng et al., 2003). Hsd17b7l was identified only in grouper, fugu, tilapia and medaka in this study, and its function has not been studied yet. HSD17B10 catalyzes the oxidation of neuroactive steroids and degradation of isoleucine in the nervous system (Yang et al., 2014). HSDL1 and HSDL2 is highly expressed in human testis and ovary tissue (Huang et al., 2001; Dai et al., 2003). However, the function of Hsd3b7, Hsd17b7l, Hsd17b10, Hsdl1, and Hsdl2 in the gonad is not well understood. Therefore, further studies are required to reveal their functions in the gonad and their roles in the sex reversal of grouper.Theβ-hsd genes play important roles in the biosynthesis and metabolism of steroids. In the present study, a genome-wide analysis identified numbers of the β-hsd genes in the human (22), mouse (24), chicken (16), xenopus (24), coelacanth (17), spotted gar (14), zebrafish (19), fugu (19), tilapia (19), medaka (19), stickleback (17), grouper (19), and common carp (27) samples. A comparative analysis revealed that the number of β-hsd genes in teleost fish was no greater than in tetrapods due to gene loss followed by the teleost-specific whole-genome duplication event. Transcriptome-based expression profiling uncovered the expressions of the β-hsd genes during the sex reversal of grouper. The exact roles of these differentially expressed β-hsd genes during sex reversal need to be precisely characterized in the future.All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines and approval of the Animal Research and Ethics Committees of Sun Yat-sen University.LX performed the experiments and wrote the manuscript.

The small W chromosome comprises only 28 protein coding genes (homologues to Z chromosome counterparts) and a number of repeat regions. Here, we report our analysis of one of these genes, BTF3 (basic transcription factor 3), which exhibits differential expression during gonadogenesis. We measured RNA levels of both Z and W homologues and BTF3 protein levels in male and female gonads during development of the chicken embryo. In addition, BTF3 RNA and protein levels were compared in female gonads (ovary) and in female gonads following treatment to induce sex reversal (testis). Combined BTF3 RNA levels were higher in female gonads than male gonads, while BTF3-Z was expressed at similar levels in males and females. Surprisingly, BTF3 protein levels were higher in male gonads than female gonads at embryonic day 6 (E6), suggesting translational rather than transcriptional regulation. BTF3 protein was expressed in both somatic and germ cells and was restricted to the medulla of the developing ovary in females and the sex cords of the developing testis in males. In addition, in gonadal sex-reversed females, RNA and protein levels of BTF3 were similar to those normally found in male gonads, suggesting that BTF3 expression correlated with the gonadal phenotype.© 2020 S.

The other data are presented in the Electronic Supplementary Material.Amniotes possess variability in sex determination, ranging from environmental sex determination to genotypic sex determination with differentiated sex chromosomes. Differentiated sex chromosomes have emerged independently several times. Their noteworthy convergent characteristic is the evolutionary stability, documented among amniotes in mammals, birds, and some lineages of lizards, snakes and turtles. Combining the analysis of multiple partial transcriptomes with the comparison of copy gene numbers between male and female genomes, we uncovered partial gene content of the highly differentiated ZZ/ZW sex chromosomes in the gecko genus Paroedura. The differentiated ZZ/ZW sex chromosomes of these geckos share genes with the part of the chicken chromosome 4 homologous with the XX/XY sex chromosomes of viviparous mammals and the ZZ/ZW sex chromosomes of lacertid lizards, as well as with the chicken chromosome 15, homologous with the XX/XY sex chromosomes of iguanas and ZZ/ZW sex chromosomes of softshell turtles. Along with other analogous cases, this finding reinforces the observation that particular chromosomes are repeatedly coopted for the function of sex chromosomes in amniotes. Notably, according to the phylogenetic distribution, the subclade of the genus Paroedura represents a rare case of the reversal of the for a considerable evolutionary time highly differentiated ZZ/ZW sex chromosomes back to poorly differentiated state.Volume28, Issue12June 2019Pages 3042-3052Author affiliationsKeywords: FadrozoleInsulin-like growth factor-1Sex reversalTestis developmentInsulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) and anti-aromatase synergistically increase the rate and stability of female-to-male sex reversal as well as pre- and postnatal weight gains in hatched chickens. This study aimed at assessing gene expression profiles of chicken embryos treated with IGF1 and fadrozole. Day 3.5 fertile eggs were in ovo injected with one of IGF1, fadrozole anti-aromatase, combined IGF1 and fadrozole, or sham injection. The expression profile was studied on day 6 and day 11 of the embryonic development following gonadal differentiation. On day 6 of embryonic development, simultaneous injection of IGF1 and fadrozole significantly upregulated the expression of RSPO1, AMH, and SOX9 in genetically female embryos compared to single injections and control groups. Also, a higher expression of ESR1 and BMP4 was observed in genetically male embryos on day 6 compared to the control group. In day 11 embryos, a higher expression of BMP4 was detected in both males and females of the IGF1 and fadrozole-administered group compared to the sham injection cohort. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that combined effects of IGF1 and fadrozole induce female-to-male sex reversal by increasing the expression of testis developmental factors rather than attenuating ovary developmental factors.© 2019 S.

Nevertheless, research on individual variation in animal cognition is still limited. Further, although individual cognitive abilities have been suggested to be linked to personality (i.e., consistent behavioral differences among individuals), few studies have linked performance across multiple cognitive tasks to personality traits. Thus, the interplays between cognition and personality are still unclear. We therefore investigated the relationships between an important aspect of cognition, learning, and personality, by exposing young and adult red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) to multiple learning tasks (discriminative, reversal, and spatial learning) and personality assays (novel arena, novel object, and tonic immobility). Learning speed was not correlated across learning tasks, and learning speed in discrimination and spatial learning tasks did not co-vary with personality. However, learning speed in reversal tasks was associated with individual variation in exploration, and in an age-dependent manner. More explorative chicks learned the reversal task faster than less explorative ones, while the opposite association was found for adult females (learning speed could not be assayed in adult males). In the same reversal tasks, we also observed a sex difference in learning speed of chicks, with females learning faster than males. Our results suggest that the relationship between cognition and personality is complex, as shown by its task- and age-dependence, and encourage further investigation of the causality and dynamics of this relationship.In the ancestor of today’s chickens, the red junglefowl, we explored how personality and cognition relate by exposing both chicks and adults to several learning tasks and personality assays. Our birds differed in personality and learning speed, while fast learners in one task did not necessarily learn fast in another (i.e., there were no overall “smarter” birds). Exploration correlated with learning speed in the more complex task of reversal learning: faster exploring chicks, but slower exploring adult females, learned faster, compared to less explorative birds. Other aspects of cognition and personality did not correlate. Our results suggest that cognition and personality are related, and that the relationship can differ depending on task and age of the animal.Cognition defines how individuals perceive, process, store, and act on environmental stimuli, and includes perception, learning, and decision-making (Dukas 2004; Shettleworth 2010). Cognitive processes influence behavior that can have fitness consequences (for review see Dukas 2004; Shettleworth 2010). Yet, individual variation in cognition has been relatively understudied in non-human animals (Sih and Del Giudice 2012; Thornton and Dukas 2012; Griffin et al. 2015; Shaw and Schmelz 2017; Boogert et al. 2018). Among the potential factors accounting for between-individual differences in cognitive traits (e.g., learning, memory) are sex differences (e.g., Range et al. 2006; Halpern 2012) and genetic variation (see Dukas 2004 for review). For example, male ravens (Corvus corax) learned an association faster than females (Range et al. 2006), and selection on learning performance in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) led to a dramatic divergence in learning performance between two selection lines (Lofdahl et al. 1992). Animal personality (i.e., consistent differences among individuals in behavioral responses, aka coping styles or behavioral types; Gosling 2001; Dall et al. 2004; Sih et al. 2004) has been hypothesized to be functionally related to individual differences in cognition (Sih and Del Giudice 2012; Griffin et al. 2015). Among studies that have investigated this relationship in non-human animals, most have focused on learning speed and have related this trait to personality traits (recently reviewed by Dougherty and Guilliette 2018) such as boldness (e.g., guppies, Poecilia reticulata, Dugatkin and Alfieri 2003; Eastern water skink, Eulamprus quoyii, Carazo et al. 2014), activity (e.g., mice, Mus musculus, Matzel et al. 2006; zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, Brust et al. 2013), exploration (e.g., great tits, Parus major, Titulaer et al. 2012; black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, Guilette et al. 2009, 2011, 2015; mallards, Anas platyrhynchos, Bousquet et al. 2015), and neophobia (Florida scrub-jays, Aphelocoma coerulescens, Bebus et al. 2016).In contrast to the relatively limited number of studies on this in animals, in human personality research, there is a long tradition of relating personality to cognitive styles (i.e., the way individuals acquire, process, store, and act on information, independent of cognitive ability, e.g., Eysenck 1978, 1981; Furnham 1992; Sih and Del Giudice 2012). For example, extroverts responded quickly to information as opposed to more reflective introverts (Furnham 1992). However, cognition and personality are complex constructs and their interrelationship is still debated and not fully resolved (Griffin et al. 2015; Volkova and Rusalov 2016, and references therein).In animals, the main framework linking variation in personality and cognition is centered on a speed–accuracy trade-off (Sih and Del Giudice 2012), which predicts that individuals may employ different cognitive styles (being either fast or accurate) based on personality or coping style. Proactive individuals (typically described as bold, aggressive, fast explorers, Benus et al. 1990; Koolhaas et al. 1999, 2010; Coppens et al. 2010) are expected to adapt a speed-over-accuracy strategy and learn simple tasks quickly, but make more mistakes when tasks become more difficult (Sih and Del Giudice 2012). Reactive individuals, which adopt a strategy of accuracy over speed, are instead predicted to learn new tasks relatively slowly compared to proactive individuals, but to pay more attention to changes, and therefore make fewer errors when tasks require responding to a change of environmental stimuli. Individuals are thus expected to differ in learning speed depending on personality, but the relationship is also expected to be task-specific (i.e., varying with the presented task, Koolhaas et al. 2010; Sih and Del Giudice 2012; Griffin et al. 2015). However, empirical research exploring speed–accuracy trade-offs report somewhat unclear results. For example, in some species, reactive individuals performed better at both avoidance learning (Exnerová et al. 2010) and reversal learning tasks (black-capped chickadee, Guillette et al. 2011; cavy, Cavia aperea, Guenther et al. 2014), while in others, there were no differences (Amy et al. 2012; Guillette et al. 2015). Yet, other studies found a nonlinear relationship between spatial learning and boldness (Eastern water skink, Carazo et al. 2014). Taken together, these findings support that the relationship between learning speed and personality can be complex, and possibly species-dependent, and imply that a speed–accuracy trade-off may not always underlie observed relationships between cognition and personality.A limitation of recent studies is that they typically assess cognitive performance in a single task and relate this to a single personality trait (Griffin et al. 2015). Here we have included multiple measures for both cognition and personality. However, to improve our understanding of the nature and generality of the observed relationship between personality and cognition, performance across different cognitive domains should be more broadly assayed (Griffin et al. 2015).In order to shed light on these issues, we investigated the relationship between variation in learning across several commonly used cognitive tasks, ranging from relatively simple ones to more complex tasks, and commonly used measures of personality in fowl, in both juvenile and adult red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) (Favati et al. 2016; Zidar et al. 2017a, b). In other bird species, some studies report sex differences in learning where males are faster than females (e.g., great tits, Titulaer et al. 2012; zebra finches, Brust et al. 2013), while other studies find females to be faster than males (e.g., great tits, Brodin and Urhan 2015). A recent meta-analysis confirms that there can be large differences between the sexes (Dougherty and Guillette 2018). Whether learning speed across tasks correlate or not also differs among avian species (e.g., correlate: North Island robins, Petroica longipes, Shaw et al. 2015, Australian magpies, Cracticus tibicen dorsalis, Ashton et al. 2018; correlate negatively: Florida scrub-jays, Bebus et al. 2016; do not correlate: black-capped chickadees, Guilliette et al. 2015; song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, Andersson et al. 2017). Regarding the correlation between personality and learning specifically, in great tits selected for fast and slow exploration, one study found that exploration did not explain variation in discriminative learning, but that birds from the slow selection line took more trials to learn a reversal learning task (Amy et al. 2012), while another study showed that slow female explorers outperformed fast explorers in discrimination learning (Titulaer et al. 2012). In zebra finches, more active and fearful individuals learned faster (Burst et al. 2013); in mallards, fast-exploring individuals took longer to accomplish a spatial task (Bousquet et al. 2015), while in black-capped chickadees, exploration did not explain variation in learning speed (Guilliette et al. 2015). A recent meta-analysis that explored the link between personality traits (exploration, boldness, activity, aggression, and sociability) and cognition (initial learning/reversal speed, number of correct choices/errors after standard training) found a significant association between variation in personality and variation in cognition (Dougherty and Guillette 2018). The direction of these relationships was vastly variable (Dougherty and Guillette 2018). Based on this, our study was set out to explore (i) sex differences in learning speed, (ii) learning speed across tasks, and (iii) how learning speed is linked to personality, in chick and adult red junglefowl. Based on previous studies, we predict that males and females will differ in learning speed (Titulaer et al. 2012; Brust et al. 2013; Brodin and Urhan 2015), learning speed co-varies across tasks, showing a positive correlation (e.g., Ashton et al. 2018), that there will be an association between personality and cognition (Dougherty and Guillette 2018) where fast explorers learn faster in simpler tasks (i.e., our discriminative and spatial learning task), while slow explorers learn faster in more complex tasks (i.e., our reversal learning task, Sih and Del Giudice 2012).We conducted personality and cognitive assays between March and September 2013 on a captive population of red junglefowl reared at Linköping University, Sweden. All birds originated from two sources (Copenhagen Zoo and Götala Research station, Skara) held in captivity for over 12 generations (Schütz and Jensen 2001) and pedigree bred since 2011. Founders and study populations have been randomly bred and not subject to any intentional selection, and our study animals look and behave similarly to their wild ancestors (Schütz and Jensen 2001). All individuals were artificially incubated and reared together without exposure to their mothers, thereby reducing any influence that maternal effects and accumulated ontogenetic experiences may have on development of cognitive abilities and personality (Stamps and Groothuis 2010).To be able to assay a large number of individuals across different cognitive tasks and at the same age, we used two batches of chicks, separated by 3 weeks, totaling 100 individuals (nfemales = 55, nmales = 45, nfamilies = 18). All chicks were marked with wing tags to facilitate recognition and housed in same-age, mixed-sex groups (1–3 groups per batch) in indoor enclosures (0.5–3 m2, size increasing with the age of the chicks). Not all chicks took part in all cognitive tasks (see below), and test individuals were chosen to represent all available families. Eight weeks post-hatching, following the first set of cognitive tasks and personality assays (see below), 87 individuals (nfemales = 45, nmales = 42) were moved to an experimental chicken facility, at Linköping University, and kept in a single group until sexual maturity when birds were divided into two groups according to sex. All birds had ad libitum access to water, commercial poultry food, dust bath, and perches, but were deprived of mealworms (used as reward) between test trials.In all tests, individuals were tested singly, and between 8 and 18 local time (lights were on 7–19), following descriptions of previous testing in the same population (e.g., Zidar et al. 2017a, b; Sorato et al. 2018). Sex of subjects (because young chicks are monomorphic) and their personality (since personality was measured after cognitive testing) were not known to observers at the time of cognitive testing; thus, we aimed to minimize observer bias.Chicks were handled from day 1 post-hatching and gently habituated to the test arena (28 × 18 × 37 cm, see SI, Fig. S1), and to temporary isolation from their pen mates. Three days post-hatching, the ability to learn a simple association was tested (nfemales = 35, nmales = 27). Chicks had to associate a conditioned stimulus (CS), randomly assigned to be blue or green color, with an unconditioned stimulus (US), ca. one third of a mealworm (see Zidar et al. 2017b, for detailed information on the test setup). Vision is the primary sense in many bird species including the fowl, and novel colors are readily learned in chickens (Osorio et al. 1999; Zylinski and Osorio 2013). We measured reflectance of colors with a light spectrometer (Ocean Optics, Dunedin, FL, USA, USB2000 PX-2 pulsed xenon light source spectrometer), confirming that they are perceived as separate colors by domestic fowl, with the same intensities and color distances from the achromatic point in a two-dimensional color space describing photoreceptor stimulations in the chick eye (see Osorio et al. 1999). Chicks were allowed to make a discriminative choice by moving from a set starting point at one end of the arena to the other end where two bowls (one green and one blue) were placed (ca. 20 cm away, see Fig. S1). The reward in the bowl could not be seen by the chick until just above the bowl. The chick was placed with its head facing away from the bowls and a trial started as soon as the chick turned around and was facing the bowls (i.e., a “trial” was defined as when a chick walked from the starting position to the bowls). The trial ended as soon as the chick had made its choice and eaten a mealworm (i.e., even if a chick chose the incorrect bowl, it was allowed to inspect the correct bowl and consume the mealworm). To reduce individual variation in learning performance due to different levels of habituation or emotional state (i.e., fear, anxiety), each chick was allowed the amount of time it needed to make a choice (which usually occurred within seconds).To decrease the possibility that a chick would make unilateral choices, i.e., that it may associate the reward with its position rather than the color cue, the stimuli changed place (left–right) between each trial. An additional side preference test showed no side bias at this age (days 6 and 17, see Fig. S2). After each trial and while the two cues were repositioned, the chick was held outside the arena, precluding the possibility to observe the positioning of the reward. A session lasted for a maximum of 15 min; the session could be shorter depending if a chick was not motivated in the test. Each chick was allowed a maximum of eight training sessions, with minimum 1 h of rest between sessions, over 2 days to learn the discriminative task. This was enough for all except one individual to learn the tasks. We assumed that a chick had learned the task if it met a criterion of five correct choices in a row in a single session. If a chick had learnt the task late in the afternoon, it was not tested any further in the day, but instead went through a “refresh trial” in the following morning (which was not included in our measure of trials needed to reach our learning criterion because it took place after our criterion was reached), where it again had to make five correct choices in a row before continuing to the next learning task. This was done to ensure that the association between the stimuli and reward was salient before moving on to reversal learning (see below). In simulations under the null hypothesis scenario of random choice, only an average of 3% of our putative learners could have passed this criterion by chance (Sorato et al. 2018). The total number of trials (choices) until the criterion was reached provided a measure of individual “learning speed.”After reaching the criterion for discrimination learning, chicks were assayed in a reversal learning task: the association between cue and reward was reversed, so that the previously unrewarded stimulus was now rewarded and vice versa. The reversal learning task was conducted in a similar fashion as the discrimination learning task with regard to the amount of time given, number of training sessions (with up to eight training sessions over 4 days), alteration of the side of stimuli, measure of learning speed, and learning criterion (Zidar et al. 2017b). Four birds did not learn to associate the reversed stimulus with a reward within the given time frame and were therefore not included in the analysis (sample size analyzed: nfemales = 33, nmales = 24).At 5 weeks of age, the previously tested chicks (n = 62) were trained to learn the location of a food reward (a mealworm in a bowl) located 0.5 m after a turn in a U-shaped arena (76 × 114 cm, Fig. S3, Zidar et al. 2017a, b). The chicks could not see the reward from the starting position. This has similarities to spatial tasks used in rodents (Benus et al. 1990), and, although simple, we call it a spatial task. Chicks were trained to form a routine and move directly to the reward after release. If the task was performed five times in a row within the same session, without the chick stopping or turning around (Zidar et al. 2017b), the chick was assumed to have learnt. The number of trials needed to reach this criterion was used as “learning speed.” Six individuals did not engage in the task and were not able to learn the task and were therefore not included in the analysis (sample size analyzed: nfemales = 30, nmales = 26).For all chicks, each training session lasted ca. 15 min, unless a chick lost motivation for the reward (e.g., did not want to eat the mealworm, were distress calling, or tried to fly out of the test arena). If a training session ended before a routine had been formed, a new session commenced after approximately 1 h of rest.While adult females readily work for food rewards, sexually mature male fowl (≥ 5 months of age, Johansen and Zuk 1998) are harder to motivate to engage in a task using food as reward. Re-testing of learning speed therefore only included females (n = 45). To increase the sample size, we included both females that had been tested in the cognitive tasks as chicks (n = 27) and females (n = 18) that were not. Adult females were tested in a lab room adjacent to their home pen. To avoid memory effects, we used two novel cues consisting of two different color patterns (white background with black circle or black background with white circle; the amounts of black and white were 50–50%). Both novel colors and contrast patterns are readily learned in chickens (Osorio et al. 1999; Zylinski and Osorio 2013); thus, we did not expect differences in task difficulty for chicks and adults. The discriminative task for adults differed somewhat from that used in chicks and was adjusted because of the difference in behavior between chicks and adults. Females were trained to associate one of the two patterns with a reward (mealworm), hidden in a bowl underneath a patterned lid. Same as for chicks, females were randomly assigned to be trained on either of the two stimuli, while the left–right position of the two patterns now changed between trials in a random manner (role of a dice). Training took place on a table with females facing the tester and the two bowls. Three steps were used to facilitate learning: (i) reward was presented on top of the lid, (ii) reward was placed in the bowl half-covered by the lid so that the fowl could see the worm, and finally (iii) the bird had to remove the lid to reach the reward under it. Females were trained to remove the lid to obtain the reward and a choice was noted as “correct” if the rewarded stimulus was chosen. Females were only allowed one choice per trial and were not allowed to collect the reward if they chose the incorrect stimulus. A black shield was placed in front of the female so that she could not see when the stimuli changed places. Similarly, as earlier described for chicks, the criterion for learning was five correct choices in a row, and the number of trials needed until this was obtained was recorded as “learning speed.” All three steps of learning were included when measuring learning speed. All individuals got exactly 100 trials over six training sessions over 2 days to learn the association, enabling us to estimate learning curves (see Fig. S4a). Consistent with learning, individuals chose at random at the beginning of the discrimination test, and the proportion of correct choices increased steadily over trials towards 80% of correct choices (calculated in learning blocks of 5, Fig. S4a). Eleven females failed to learn the association and were not included in the analysis (where 7 were previously tested as chicks).Following the discrimination learning task, females that had succeeded in associating a stimulus with a reward (n = 34) were exposed to a reversal learning task. No pre-training was required and the task was conducted in the same way as for the discrimination learning task described above and for 100 trials, except that now the previously unrewarded stimulus was rewarded while the previously rewarded stimulus was not. Females showed a high proportion of errors (80%) at the beginning of the test (matching the rate at the end of the previous discriminative test), and rate of correct choices increased with test progression and reached a stable level of about 80% correct choices (calculated in learning blocks of 5) at the end of the test (Fig. S4b). Twenty-seven females successfully learned the task, while 7 females failed to learn the task and were excluded from the analysis (where 6 of the latter were previously tested as chicks).All individuals were tested in three personality assays (a novel arena, novel object, and tonic immobility test, see below), at 4 and 6 weeks of age (Zidar et al. 2017a, b).To quantify variation in exploration and boldness, a novel arena test was performed (Forkman et al. 2007; Réale et al. 2007). Empty, familiar food, and water containers were placed in the arena (76 × 114 cm) to obscure the chicks’ full view and encourage exploration. The substrate was changed (first test occasion: wood shavings; second test occasion: shredded cardboard paper) and placement of containers altered to keep the environment novel between the test occasions (Fig. S6a, b). A chick was gently caught from its home pen and placed at one of the arena’s short sides during darkness. Behavioral measures of its responses started when the lights were turned on again. To prevent the chicks from escaping, a metal grid was placed over the arena. To be able to observe if the birds used the entire arena or only parts of the arena, we divided the arena into six equally sized (imagined) sections (i.e., the birds could not see these sections) and scored how many of these imaginary sections the bird visited during the test. Behaviors were scored live via video cameras connected to computer screens using an instantaneous recording rule every 10 s for the 10 min the test lasted. Latencies were on the other hand scored continuously (i.e., as exact latencies) and behaviors that occurred in very low frequencies were recorded continuously as number of occurring events (Table 1). Behaviors were based on previous personality studies in the fowl (Favati et al. 2014, b, 2016; Zidar et al. 2017a, b). Each chick was scored by one observer out of a total of four, and scoring was blind with regard to the bird’s scores on previous cognitive tests.To score variation in boldness and neophobia (Réale et al. 2007), a novel object (a spherical, brown/beige plush toy measuring 15 cm and with ca. 2-cm large yellow and black eyes) was placed in the arena. The novel object was placed along one of the short sides inside the arena directly after the novel arena test had finished. This occurred after birds had had 10 min to familiarize themselves with the test arena, which reduce confounding effects of a novel object being presented in a novel environment (Réale et al. 2007). Because the toy may resemble a potential predator, we aimed to capture both neophobia and boldness (Greggor et al. 2015). Lights were turned off while placing the novel object in the arena (birds were standing still in darkness), as far away from the chick as possible. The same behaviors as described above were scored. The novel object test lasted for 10 min starting when the object was introduced and the lights were turned on again.Tonic immobility is a commonly used test of fear responses in birds (Forkman et al. 2007). Birds were calmly collected from their home pen and tested in a lab room adjacent to the home pen. To induce tonic immobility, a chick was placed on its back in a V-shaped wooden stand (20 × 10 cm). A light pressure was applied to its breast while also loosely holding a hand over its head for 15 s. Thereafter, the pressure was released and latency until the chick moved its head (“Latency to move TI”) was recorded. If the chick jumped up on its feet within 3 s following the removal of the pressure by the hand, the procedure was repeated a total of three times. If the bird was still not induced into tonic immobility after three attempts, the chick received a score of 0 s. If the chick stayed immobile more than 10 min, it received a maximum score of 600 s and the test was terminated. The observer avoided direct eye contact with the chick, and the same observer did all tonic immobility tests. The observer was blind to the birds’ learning scores in other tests. The tonic immobility test was performed after the novel arena and novel object tests, and on a separate day from these tests, with the aim that birds had similar initial stress level prior to the test.At 5 months of age, following sexual maturity, all individuals were again tested in novel arena, novel object, and tonic immobility tests. Novel arena and novel object tests followed each other, as previously described. The arena (2 × 2 m) had peat as substrate and as for chicks, empty, familiar food and water containers were placed within to encourage exploration. To reduce the risk of between-individual differences in stress level prior to the test, the birds were collected from their home pen in a calm manner and with the light switched off. The novel object had the same shape and size as used for chicks, but a different color (black/gray/white). The tonic immobility test was performed on a separate day in a lab room adjacent to the home pen. Behaviors were scored by direct observations. All three tests were otherwise performed and scored in the same manner as described above for chicks (Zidar et al. 2017b).All analyses and model selections described below were conducted in R version 3.2.2.Rank order consistency in learning speed across cognitive and behavioral tasks within the same age class, and over time, were explored by the Spearman rank correlations. We adjusted p values for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate procedure for multiple testing (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995).Some behaviors occurred in very low frequencies or showed little variation between individuals (freezing, standing, preening, laying down, foraging, other behaviors (e.g., flapping wings, shaking body)) and were not analyzed further. For the remaining behavioral variables (novel arena: “Locomotion,” “Vigilance,” “Latency to move,” “Latency to explore all areas”; novel object: “Vigilance” and “Number of escape attempts”, Table 1), we used the mean of behavioral responses obtained at 4 and 6 weeks, if correlations of responses obtained at 4 and 6 weeks showed the same direction for males and females. This resulted in pooled data for all behavior, except for “Latency to move TI” (Table S1). Accordingly, this variable was analyzed separately using only data from the behavioral responses obtained at 4 weeks of age (because this was obtained closer in time to cognitive testing).Behavioral variables from novel arena and novel object tests were reduced by the use of a principal component analysis (PCA) with the R-package “FactoMineR.” Two distinct principal components with eigenvalues ˃ 1 were obtained for chicks (Table 2, Fig. S7) and adults (Table 2, Fig. S8), interpreted as describing individuals that are more or less exploratory (PC1, see Table 2) and shy (PC2, see Table 2).Across learning tasks, some birds failed to learn the task (between 1 and 11 individuals, dependent on task). Several of these birds failed to learn because they did not engage at all in the task, and as a consequence never had the possibility to learn the task. There are also potential problems with arbitrarily given maximum values (e.g., “ceiling effects,” Stamps and Groothuis 2010); therefore, we only analyzed learning speed of individuals that learned the tasks.To investigate if there were any biases in learning that were due to the type of cue associated with the reward, we performed the Mann–Whitney U tests to assess whether learning speed differed according to the color (chicks) or pattern (adult females) that was matched to the reward.To explore whether learning speed in the various tasks related to personality, we first evaluated normality by visual inspection of histograms of model residuals. To obtain homogenous variances on non-normally distributed count data (learning speed in discriminative learning and spatial learning), we used the function Box-Cox to find suitable transformations for our response variables. This resulted in log transformation of learning speed in the discriminative learning tasks for both chicks and adult females, and in the spatial learning task. Learning speed in the reversal learning task was approximately normally distributed for both chicks and adult hens and was therefore left untransformed. For chicks, models had Gaussian distribution with identity link and contained the variables “Sex” (i.e., male or female), “Exploration” (PC1), “Shyness” (PC2), “Sex*Exploration” (PC1), “Sex*Shyness” (PC2) as fixed effects, and “Family” added as a random effect. For adults, models did not include “Sex” because no adult males were tested. Models investigating the effect of variation in tonic immobility included the variables “Sex” (i.e., male or female), “Latency to move TI,” and “Sex*Latency to move TI” with “Family” as random effect. We explored full models containing all predictor variables. We centered factors so that zeros would correspond to the average value of the predictor. Results obtained following this approach were robust, because analyzing the data with other distributions (negative binomial or Poisson distribution) gave statistically similar results.The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available in Table S2 as a supplementary table.Based on individual rank order, learning speed was not correlated across learning tasks in either chicks or adult hens (Table 3, Fig. S5). Individual rank order of learning speed was not correlated in females over time (chick to adult) for either discrimination learning (rs = − 0.12, n = 19, p = 0.62) or reversal learning (rs = − 0.37, n = 12, p = 0.23).For behavioral responses in personality assays, individual consistency was present in chicks, between 4 and 6 weeks of age (rs = 0.2–0.5, n = 100, p = 0.001–0.10, Table S1), but was weaker when comparing chicks and adults (rs = 0.1–0.3, n = 87, p = 0.03–0.93, Table S1).Individuals varied in number of trials needed to discriminate between the two colors (range, 7–64; mean ± SE, 24.02 ± 1.61), but learning speed was not explained by sex, personality, or their interaction (Sex: χ2 = 0.05, df = 1, p = 0.82; Sex effect from model with TI: χ2 = 0.02, df = 1, p = 0.89; Exploration: χ2 = 0.00, df = 1, p = 1.00; Shyness: χ2 = 0.05, df = 1, p = 0.82; TI: χ2 = 0.22, df = 1, p = 0.64; Sex*Exploration: χ2 = 1.05, df = 1, p = 0.30; Sex*Shyness: χ2 = 2.00, df = 1, p = 0.16; Sex*TI: χ2 = 0.86, df = 1, p = 0.35). Individuals found it easier to associate a blue color with a reward, than a green color (Mann–Whitney U test: W = 282.5, p = 0.009), but analyzing colors separately did not significantly change the results (blue: Sex: χ2 = 0.02, df = 1, p = 0.88; Exploration: χ2 = 0.26, df = 1, p = 0.61; Shyness: χ2 = 0.45, df = 1, p = 0.50; Sex*Exploration: χ2 = 0.48, df = 1, p = 0.49; Sex*Shyness: χ2 = 1.64, df = 1, p = 0.20; green: Sex: χ2 = 0.17, df = 1, p = 0.68; Exploration: χ2 = 0.24, df = 1, p = 0.63; Shyness: χ2 = 0.91, df = 1, p = 0.33; Sex*Exploration: χ2 = 0.05, df = 1, p = 0.82; Sex*Shyness: χ2 = 1.61, df = 1, p = 0.20).Learning speed in the reversal learning task (range, 10–62; mean ± SE, 32.98 ± 1.76) was explained by both personality and sex. More explorative individuals (PC1) of both sexes learned the reversal task in fewer trials, compared to less explorative individuals (Exploration: χ2 = 4.67, df = 1, p = 0.03, estimate = − 1.91, Fig. 1a), and females learned faster than males (Sex: χ2 = 6.68, df = 1, p = 0.01, estimate = 8.56; Sex effect from model with TI: χ2 = 6.17, df = 1, p = 0.01, estimate = 7.75, Fig. 1a). Neither shyness, tonic immobility, nor interactions between personality variables and sex explained learning speed (Shyness: χ2 = 0.16, df = 1, p = 0.69; TI: χ2 = 0.00, df = 1, p = 0.95; Sex*Exploration: χ2 = 1.39, df = 1, p = 0.24; Sex*Shyness: χ2 = 0.43, df = 1, p = 0.51; Sex*TI: χ2 = 0.24, df = 1, p = 0.62). One female chick obtained an extreme exploration score, but analyses without this bird did not change the results qualitatively or quantitatively (Exploration: χ2 = 6.06, df = 1, p = 0.01; Shyness: χ2 = 0.02, df = 1, p = 0.89; Sex: χ2 = 4.56, df = 1, p = 0.03; Sex*Exploration: χ2 = 0.49, df = 1, p = 0.48; Sex*Shyness: χ2 = 0.15, df = 1, p = 0.70). There was no difference in the learning speed for blue and green colors in the reversal learning task (Mann–Whitney U test: W = 489.5, p = 0.12).The relationship between learning (i.e., number of trials needed to reach the learning criteria) in a reversal learning task and exploration (PC1 from a PCA analysis) was a negative for chicks; more explorative individuals learned faster, and females (gray circles, dashed line) learned faster than males (black circles, solid line), and b positive for adult females where less explorative females learned faster. A single female outlier was removed from the sample (see the “Results” section for statistics including this data point)Individual differences in spatial learning (range, 13–75; mean ± SE, 32.4 ± 2.05) were not explained by sex, personality, or their interaction (Sex: χ2 = 2.13, df = 1, p = 0.14; Sex in the model with TI: χ2 = 0.85, df = 1, p = 0.36; Exploration: χ2 = 0.60, df = 1, p = 0.40; Shyness: χ2 = 3.25, df = 1, p = 0.07; TI: χ2 = 0.86, df = 1, p = 0.35; Sex*Exploration: χ2 = 0.37, df = 1, p = 0.55; Sex*Shyness: χ2 = 0.10, df = 1, p = 0.75; Sex*TI: χ2 = 0.08, df = 1, p = 0.77).Learning speed of adult females in the discrimination learning task (range, 15–93; mean ± SE, 46.32 ± 3.75) was not explained by personality differences (Exploration: χ2 = 0.01, df = 1, p = 0.93; Shyness: χ2 = 3.60, df = 1, p = 0.06; TI: χ2 = 0.96, df = 1, p = 0.33). There was no difference in learning speed dependent on rewarded stimuli (Mann–Whitney U test: W = 150, p = 0.85).Differences in learning speed among adult females in the reversal learning task (range, 24–100; mean ± SE, 65.22 ± 4.53) were explained by exploration (Exploration: χ2 = 7.00, df = 1, p = 0.008, estimate = 9.85, Fig. 1b), though here the association between the two traits was reversed compared to chicks: less explorative female fowl were faster at reversal learning (Fig. 1b). Similar to chicks, neither shyness nor tonic immobility predicted learning speed in the reversal learning task (Shyness: χ2 = 1.86, df = 1, p = 0.17; TI: χ2 = 0.25, df = 1, p = 0.61). Adult hens learned to associate both stimuli with a reward equally fast (Mann–Whitney U test: W = 0.94, p = 0.13).In the current study, we investigated the relationship between learning speed and personality in male and female chicks, and adult female red junglefowl, by using multiple cognitive tasks and personality assays. We observed large differences between individuals in learning speed in all cognitive tasks, but no rank order consistency in learning speed within individuals across different learning tasks neither in chicks nor in adults. Female chicks learned faster than males in a reversal learning task, but no sex differences were apparent in discrimination and learning of location in an arena. Additionally, we found a task- and age-dependent relationship between learning speed and personality; explorative chicks, as opposed to less explorative adult females, were faster at reversal learning.It has recently been suggested that studies in cognition should focus on individual variation (Shaw and Schmelz 2017; Boogert et al. 2018) and be investigated in tasks spanning different cognitive domains (Griffin et al. 2015), an approach not yet commonly adopted. We aimed to follow this recommendation and scored individual variation in three different learning tasks: discriminative, reversal, and spatial learning. Discrimination learning underlies the ability to associate a stimulus with appetitive or aversive stimuli, reversal learning involves the capability of extinguishing a previously learned association to form a new one, while spatial learning measures the ability to locate a reward that is out of sight, in an arena. Of these three tasks, reversal learning is considered to be more cognitively challenging due to the extinction of previously learned cues and learning of new associations (Coppens et al. 2010). Here, performance was not correlated across different tasks; thus, we did not find support for individuals having a higher general learning ability (“g”), which has been observed in humans (e.g., Plomin 1999) and mice (e.g., Matzel et al. 2003; Light et al. 2011; see review by Shaw and Schmelz 2017). While this warrants further investigation to rule out in the red junglefowl, it is supported by recent work in a larger sample (˃ 300 chicks) in the same population where discriminant and reversal learning was found to be weakly, negatively correlated (Sorato et al. 2018). This suggests that there is neither general learning performance nor a strong trade-off in learning speed between different learning tasks. Moreover, previous studies have provided mixed evidence for the existence of such trade-offs (e.g., Boogert et al. 2011; Guillette et al. 2015; Shaw et al. 2015; Bebus et al. 2016; Andersson et al. 2017). This may be explained, at least in part, by the rather large differences between studies in, for example, study design, task types used, age, and sex of the subjects. On the other hand, there could also be species-specific patterns in cognitive performance in different tasks, and relationships across tasks.We observed a spontaneous preference for blue over green in a discrimination task in chicks, while we observed no preference in the reversal learning task for chicks nor for the black and white patterns used in adults. Interestingly, a spontaneous preference for blue has previously been observed in birds (domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, over green, Fischer et al. 1975, and over red, New Zealand robins, Shaw et al. 2015) and resulted in faster learning in wild New Zealand robins (Shaw et al. 2015). Although the color cues used in our study did not change other relationships recorded, this suggests that using colors in avian discrimination learning can be problematic and that the choice of color should be considered carefully when planning learning experiments in avian species.In our study, we observe no sex difference in simpler tasks, but individual differences in learning speed were to some extent explained by sex for reversal learning where male chicks needed more trials to complete the task than females. Red junglefowl are sexually dimorphic where males are larger and more ornamented than females (Zuk et al. 1990) and sex differences in behavior are often observed (e.g., Nätt et al. 2014; Favati et al. 2016; Zidar et al. 2017a). Here we showed that differences between the sexes could be detected already in very young chicks (3–6 days post-hatching, but see Sorato et al. 2018 that in a larger sample did not find this). In domestic fowl, females seem more behaviorally flexible, while males are more persistent, which have been suggested to be linked to effects of testosterone on cholinergic activity in brain regions that are implicated in memory (Rogers 1974). When a response becomes inappropriate in a task, it might therefore be easier for females to change their response, compared to males. Sex differences in behavioral flexibility were however not detected in young chicks of our population (Zidar et al. 2017a), although we have not yet explored their physiological differences. Sex-specific learning speed is observed in a range of species tested across a range of learning tasks and setups (e.g., Range et al. 2006; Titulaer et al. 2012; Brust et al. 2013; Carazo et al. 2014), where males usually need fewer trials than females to learn a task (but see Brodin and Urhan 2015). Differences in study design and the type of tasks that are employed may explain to some extent these discrepancies. Furthermore, sex differences may vary across species depending on, for example, ecology and social organization generating different theoretical predictions on sex differences in aspects of cognition. Future studies should explore species-specific differences in sex-specific patterns of learning speed, which may be related to variation in the task used, or selection pressures the sexes are exposed to.Independent of the slight sex difference in reversal learning, we observed a link between learning and personality. Speed–accuracy trade-offs are invoked to explain associations between personality and learning (Sih and Del Giudice 2012). According to this hypothesis, individuals may employ different cognitive styles (being either fast or accurate) reflecting their personality type (e.g., speed of exploration), with fast-exploring individuals being better at quickly acquiring simple learning rules and slow ones showing superior performance in processing more complex and detailed information. In agreement with this, we observed that adult female fowl that were slow explorers in a novel environment were better at learning a complex task (reversal test). However, contrary to predictions of the speed–accuracy trade-off hypothesis, we found the opposite pattern in chicks: more explorative individuals and not less explorative ones were better at reversal learning. It is possible that explorative chicks are less distracted by that they are alone in a test arena than less explorative ones. It has, for example, been shown that stressed chicks can have higher motivation for social reinstatement (Zidar et al. 2018) and that longer latencies in tonic immobility positively correlate with motivation for social reinstatement (Marin et al. 2001). In this scenario, slow-exploring chicks, which according to coping style theory are also easily stressed and fearful (Koolhaas et al. 2010), may actually be inherently better learners, as in adults, but their learning ability might be masked by motivational differences. However, in our study, we tried to reduce neophobia and anxiety in our learning tasks as much as possible by first habituating individuals to being in the arena and also to being separated from their pen mates. Moreover, chicks received as much time as they needed to make their choice, thus removing any differences in approach latencies. We therefore do not expect that neophobia has a large impact on our results. In addition, we found no association between personality traits and discriminant learning, either in chicks or adults. Thus, our results only partially support a speed–accuracy trade-off, suggesting that the relationships between learning speed and personality may be more complexly interlinked.Studies investigating a link between cognition and personality have focused mainly on correlating performance in a single cognitive task to a single score obtained in a personality assay. Several of these confirmed a relationship between learning and personality (e.g., mice, Morris 1984; guppies, Dugatkin and Alfieri 2003; black-capped chickadees, Guillette et al. 2009, 2011, 2015; great tits, Exnerová et al. 2010; Amy et al. 2012; Titulaer et al. 2012; zebra finches, Brust et al. 2013; Florida scrub-jays, Bebus et al. 2016), and similar to our findings, the relationship is often limited to more cognitively demanding tasks (i.e., reversal learning: Guillette et al. 2011; Titulaer et al. 2012; Brust et al. 2013; but see Dogherty and Guilliette 2018). The reason why cognitively demanding tasks are more often associated with personality than simpler tasks is not clear. Higher demands on attention have been suggested as one possible aspect of complex tasks that can explain personality differences (Titulaer et al. 2012) and should be investigated further.We observed a shifting relationship between reversal learning and personality over time, which to our knowledge has not previously been documented. It is important to consider that the learning tasks we conducted on chicks and adults had methodological differences. For example, different colored cues were used for chicks and adults, and when we tested adult females, they were trained also after they reached our set learning criterion, while chicks only trained until they reached our learning criterion. Thus, even though tasks were designed to capture the same aspect of learning, we cannot exclude that differences between task implementations in chicks and adults may have influenced the outcome and potentially explain the opposite pattern in chicks and adults see Cauchoix et al. 2018. If the differences in methodology explain the observed shift in the relationship between personality and cognition, it raises important implications for research in the field. Most studies differ slightly in task design both within and across species, which may hamper comparison across studies. On the other hand, we observe particularly exploration and reversal learning to be related, in both chicks and adult female. In the red junglefowl, shifting relationships between cognition and personality over ontogeny would not be unexpected. Red junglefowl go through several stages in ontogeny (e.g., from chicks are dependent on their mother to increased independence, sexually immature to sexually mature, see references in Favati et al. 2016) that have the potential to independently affect personality (Favati et al. 2016), and learning speed within tasks was here not strongly correlated over time (but see Cauchoix et al. 2018). Further, early experiences can have long-lasting effects and affect personality traits later in life (Zidar et al. 2017b), suggesting a potential ongoing interplay between personality and cognition. However, the explanation to the observed shift in the association between personality and learning speed is currently unclear and begs for further empirical and theoretical investigation.We did not observe learning speed across tasks to inter-relate. In reversal learning, male chicks were somewhat slower learners than female chicks. We observed a relationship between cognition and personality, which is task- and age-dependent: learning speed in reversal learning and exploration of a novel arena related in both chicks and adults where explorative chicks and slower exploring females learned faster. Our results thus only partly support a speed–accuracy trade-off suggesting that also other explanations may underlie observed variation in learning. Taken together, our work adds to the growing literature on individual variation in personality and cognition, and the fowl as a model species for this research (Garnham and Løvlie 2018).Amy M, van Oers K, Naguib M (2012) Worms under cover: relationships between performance in learning tasks and personality in great tits (Parus major).

PRDM16, IGF2, NODAL and HDAC2 expressed very low in parthenogenetic embryos.Co-administration of IGF1 and Fadrozole improved development of parthenogenic embryos.IGF1 and Fadrozole increased SOX2 and NANOG expression parthenogenetic embryos.IGF1 and Fadrozole decreased the TBX3 expression in parthenogenetic embryos.PRDM16, IGF2, NODAL and HDAC2 expressed very low in parthenogenetic embryos.So far, a synergistic effect was detected between insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF1) and anti-aromatase for sex reversal and pre-/post-natal growth of fertilized chicken embryo. Here, we hypothesized whether the growth and sexual female-to-male reversal effects of IGF1 and an anti-aromatase, Fadrozole, could improve the development of unfertilized, parthenogenetic chicken embryos. Simultaneous administration of IGF1 and Fadrozole increased the percentage of grade A embryos from 1.7% (no injection group) to 70.6%. The expression profile of parthenotes and newly laid fertilized embryos showed that IGF1 and Fadrozole increased SOX2 and NANOG expression, while decreased the TBX3 expression in the parthenogenetic embryos. However, a considerably higher expression of PRDM16, IGF2, NODAL and HDAC2 was observed in the fertilized group compared to the parthenogenetic embryos. In conclusion, chicken sexual determination is initiated at the earliest stage of embryonic development before gonadal differentiation. Combined administration of IGF1 and Fadrozole increased the developmental rate of parthenogenetic embryos. Also, simultaneous supplementation of IGF1 and Fadrozole induced the expression of pluripotency genes with no effect on the expression of growth and differentiation factors.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Enables the cross-linking of phenotypic changes to underlying molecular mechanisms.A phenotypic anchoring of whole-transcriptomic changes in chicken gonads.Induced by the endocrine disrupter TBT.Enables the cross-linking of phenotypic changes to underlying molecular mechanisms.Morphological malformations induced by tributyltin (TBT) exposure during embryonic development have already been characterized in various taxonomic groups, but, nonetheless, the molecular processes underlying these changes remain obscure. The present study provides the first genome-wide screening for differentially expressed genes that are linked to morphological alterations of gonadal tissue from chicken embryos after exposure to TBT. We applied a single injection of TBT (between 0.5 and 30 pg as Sn/g egg) into incubated fertile eggs to simulate maternal transfer of the endocrine disruptive compound. Methyltestosterone (MT) served as a positive control (30 pg/g egg). After 19 days of incubation, structural features of the gonads as well as genome-wide gene expression profiles were assessed simultaneously. TBT induced significant morphological and histological malformations of gonadal tissue from female embryos that show a virilization of the ovaries. This phenotypical virilization was mirrored by altered expression profiles of sex-dependent genes. Among these are several transcription and growth factors (e.g. FGF12, CTCF, NFIB), whose altered expression might serve as a set of markers for early identification of endocrine active chemicals that affect embryonic development by transcriptome profiling without the need of elaborate histological analyses.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

The embryo with two Z chromosomes (ZZ) develops into a male; by contrast, the embryo with Z and W chromosomes (ZW) becomes female. Two theories are hypothesized for the mechanisms of avian sex determination that explain how genes carried on sex chromosomes control gonadal differentiation and development during embryogenesis. One proposes that the dosage of genes on the Z chromosome determines the sexual differentiation of undifferentiated gonads, and the other proposes that W-linked genes dominantly determine ovary differentiation or inhibit testis differentiation. Z-linked DMRT1, which is a strong candidate avian sex-determining gene, supports the former hypothesis. Although no candidate W-linked gene has been identified, extensive evidence for spontaneous sex reversal in birds and aneuploid chimeric chickens with an abnormal sex chromosome constitution strongly supports the latter hypothesis. After the sex of gonad is determined by a gene(s) located on the sex chromosomes, gonadal differentiation is subsequently progressed by several genes. Developed gonads secrete sex hormones to masculinize or feminize the whole body of the embryo. In this section, the sex-determining mechanism as well as the genes and sex hormones mainly involved in gonadal differentiation and development of chicken are introduced.Over 10 million scientific documents at your fingertips© 2020 Springer Nature Switzerland AG. Part of Springer Nature.Not logged in Not affiliated 92.38.189.10The exact genetic mechanism regulating avian gonadal sex differentiation has not been completely resolved. The most likely scenario involves a dosage mechanism, whereby the Z-linked DMRT1 gene triggers testis development. However, the possibility still exists that the female-specific W chromosome may harbor an ovarian determining factor. In this study, we provide evidence that the universal gene regulating gonadal sex differentiation in birds is Z-linked DMRT1 and not a W-linked (ovarian) factor. Three candidate W-linked ovarian determinants are HINTW, female-expressed transcript 1 (FET1), and female-associated factor (FAF). To test the association of these genes with ovarian differentiation in the chicken, we examined their expression following experimentally induced female-to-male sex reversal using the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole (FAD). Administration of FAD on day 3 of embryogenesis induced a significant loss of aromatase enzyme activity in female gonads and masculinization. However, expression levels of HINTW, FAF, and FET1 were unaltered after experimental masculinization. Furthermore, comparative analysis showed that FAF and FET1 expression could not be detected in zebra finch gonads. Additionally, an antibody raised against the predicted HINTW protein failed to detect it endogenously. These data do not support a universal role for these genes or for the W sex chromosome in ovarian development in birds. We found that DMRT1 (but not the recently identified Z-linked HEMGN gene) is male upregulated in embryonic zebra finch and emu gonads, as in the chicken. As chicken, zebra finch, and emu exemplify the major evolutionary clades of birds, we propose that Z-linked DMRT1, and not the W sex chromosome, regulates gonadal sex differentiation in birds.Sex is determined genetically in birds by the differential inheritance of the Z and W sex chromosomes (ZZ male vs ZW female). Genes on one or both of these chromosomes must regulate embryonic development of the gonads into testes (ZZ) or ovary (ZW). The avian Z chromosome is large and contains >1000 genes, whereas the W chromosome is typically smaller and contains relatively few genes (probably <30 in the chicken), virtually all of which have homologs on the Z chromosome (1–4). As for the mammalian X and Y, it is considered that the avian W is a degraded copy of the Z (5–7). However, unlike mammals, birds lack a system of global dosage compensation, such that most Z-linked genes are expressed, on average, at higher levels in males (ZZ) compared with females (ZW) (8–12). However, some degree of avian dosage compensation does occur, but on a gene-by-gene basis (13–16). In the chicken, those genes that are retained on the largely degraded W are likely to be developmentally or physiologically critical genes that are dosage sensitive (1, 3). The curious MHM sequence, which encodes a long noncoding RNA that coats the single Z of females (but only in galliform birds), has been suggested to possibly play a role in local dosage compensation, or even sex determination (17–21).The sex-determining mechanism in birds is still not fully resolved, although most evidence now favors dosage of the Z-linked gene DMRT1 as the master sex switch, at least in the gonads. This mechanism is particularly attractive, given the lack of global dosage compensation in birds (11). DMRT1 encodes a conserved zinc finger–like transcription factor implicated in testis development (22–27). Knockdown or overexpression of the gene in embryonic chicken gonads induces feminization or activation of testis pathway genes, respectively (5, 28). Another Z-linked gene, hemogen (HEMGN), is likely to lie downstream of DMRT1 in the developing testis, at least in the chicken (29). However, recent data on sexually dimorphic gene expression before gonadogenesis, analysis of rare gynandromorphic birds, and studies on sex chimeric embryos all point to the likelihood that sexual phenotype is at least partly cell autonomous in avians, with direct genetic effects in each cell of the body at least partially determining sexual phenotype (30–33). Despite the focus on the avian Z, the possibility still remains that the W sex chromosome may harbor a female-determining (or at least ovary-determining) gene (34, 35). We previously carried out an extensive screen to seek such a gene using RNA sequencing of day 0 chicken blastoderms and in embryonic gonads before (day 4) and at the onset of (day 6) sexual differentiation. A W-linked ovary-determining gene should be expressed by day 6.0 (stage 29/30), the onset of gonadal sex differentiation. We identified 26 W-linked transcripts in the chicken, but essentially all were highly homologous to Z-linked copies (gametologs) (>90% amino acid identity in most cases). These genes are likely to be dosage sensitive and have hence been retained on the W (1, 36). Both gametologs are expressed in early embryos and so most chicken W-Z gene pairs might act as de facto autosomal genes. There were three exceptions, that is, the previously identified HINTW, female-expressed transcript 1 (FET1), and female-associated factor (FAF) genes, all of which are W linked and expressed in females. In females, HINTW was expressed at a significantly higher level than its Z partner, and it showed the greatest sequence divergence (1). Meanwhile no FET1 or FAF gametologs have been assigned to the Z (4). Transcripts of these genes were present in our RNA sequencing datasets at all three time points [blastoderm, embryonic day (E)4.5, and E6.0]. These three genes are hence the best candidate ovary determinants in birds.HINTW encodes a predicted histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein, but with an altered catalytic domain (37, 38). It has a homolog on the Z, HINTZ, which does encode a bona fide histidine triad protein. In vitro biochemical data indicate that HINTW protein can dimerize with HINTZ and may render the complex nonfunctional, hence blocking HINTZ function if it had a role in testis development (39). HINTW is strongly expressed in embryonic female chicken gonads, but it is also expressed throughout the embryo during development (38, 40). Meanwhile, the FET1 gene was reported to be W linked following a screen for novel candidate female sex factors in early chicken embryos (41), and this gene is often cited as a candidate ovary determinant in the literature (42, 43). Lastly, FAF is a W-linked expressed sequence located within an intron of HINTW (31), but its expression pattern during gonadal sex differentiation has not been described.In the present study, we examined the expression of these three W-linked candidate ovary-determining genes following experimentally induced female-to-male sex reversal in chicken embryo, using the drug fadrozole (FAD). We also raised an antibody to the predicted HINTW protein to examine its expression. Our hypothesis was that if these genes are ovary-determining, their expression would be incompatible with testicular differentiation and so their expression should decline during FAD-induced sex reversal, as occurs for all other known female pathway genes. We found that all three genes were still expressed in a female-specific manner following FAD-induced masculinization. Meanwhile, the HINTW antibody could not detect an endogenous protein, suggesting that the gene might not be translated in embryos. These data make it highly unlikely that any of these three W-linked genes plays a decisive role in avian ovary development. This strengthens the notion that chicken gonadal sex is determined via the Z sex chromosome and the DMRT1 gene.Essentially all of the current information on avian sex determination and gonadal sex differentiation is derived from studies on chicken embryo, or related quail and duck embryos, which represent one clade of birds, the Galloanserae (44, 45). In the chicken, Z-linked DMRT1 is expressed in early gonads and is male upregulated prior to expression of the conserved SOX9 gene, a marker of testicular differentiation in the chicken and indeed all other vertebrates that have been examined (46, 47). In the female chicken embryo, autosomal FOXL2 is expressed just prior to CYP19A1, which encodes aromatase, essential for estrogen synthesis and ovarian development in avians (48–51). However, it is not known wheter chicken embryo is a representative model of avian gonadal development in general. DMRT1 expression in particular has not been studied in avians outside the Galloanserae. We examined expression of DMRT1 and other proposed gonadal sex differentiation genes in representatives of the other two clades of birds, the zebra finch (representing the Neoaves) and the emu (representing the Paleognathae). We find that DMRT1 shows conserved male upregulated expression in the gonads of these other species, prior to SOX9, whereas the recently described Z-linked HEMGN gene did not show conserved gonadal expression. Collectively, these data support Z-linked DMRT1 as the master sex switch governing gonadal sex differentiation among birds.Commercially available fertile eggs of the chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) and the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) were obtained at laying and artificially incubated at 37.5°C (chicken) or 36.5°C (emu) in a humidified incubator for the indicated developmental stages. Zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) embryos were obtained from nests of naturally incubated, aviary-bred birds at Deakin University (Geelong, VIC, Australia). As all embryos were examined prior to midgestation, animal ethics clearance was not required at our institute. For sexing embryos by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), handplates from embryos were collected into PCR-compatible digestion buffer [50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 0.1 mg/ml gelatin, 0.45% Nonidet P-40, 0.45% Tween 20, 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K) and digested at 55°C for 20 minutes, then at 95°C for 7 minutes to release genomic DNA. Subsequent PCR depended on amplification of a female (W chromosome)–specific fragment and an internal control, amplified in both sexes. For the chicken, sexing PCR was carried out under standard conditions, using the W-linked XhoI repeat sequence and 18S as internal control, as described previously (52). By this method, females show two bands and males show one. For the zebra finch, the CHD gene was used for multiplex allele-specific PCR, as described previously (53). The primers used for zebra finch PCR sexing are listed in Table 1. In our hands, both sexes showed a 242-bp band and some weaker larger bands, whereas only females showed an extra smaller (179-bp) band. For the emu, we used the method published by Huynen et al. (54). The homomorphic sex chromosomes of ratites are almost completely homologous, and this method relies upon amplification of a W-linked fragment found in female but not male genomic DNA. By this method, both sexes showed a major and weaker band, whereas only the female showed an additional 150-bp band. The primers used are listed in Table 1. For each species, genomic DNA from adult birds of known sex was always run in the PCR as positive controls.PCR Primers Used in This StudyFor the chicken, urogenital systems were dissected from E4.5, E6.5, and E9.5 corresponding to Hamburger and Hamilton stage (HH) 26, HH30, and HH36, respectively (55). Both the zebra finch and emu have been staged, using the HH criteria (56, 57). These staging tables were used in the present study.A single injection of the aromatase enzyme inhibitor FAD has been shown to induce female-to-male sex reversal in the chicken (48). The left gonad fails to elaborate a thickened ovarian cortex and remains undifferentiated, whereas the right gonad becomes testicular (58). On day 3 of incubation at HH18, 100 eggs were either injected with 1.0 mg of FAD (Novartis) in 100 µL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or injected with PBS alone. Following injection, the holes were sealed with parafilm as described previously (59), and eggs were incubated until day 9.5 of development (HH36) before processing for in situ hybridization or quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR).Whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) was performed as previously described (60). At least three embryos were used for each stage. Urogenital systems were dissected from chickens at E4.5, E6.5, and E9.5 corresponding to HH26, HH30, and HH36, respectively. Emu and zebra finch embryos were dissected at comparable stages before, during, and after the onset of gonadal sex differentiation. For the emu, these stages were E11 (HH 26), E14 (HH29), E16 (HH30), E21 (HH35), E25 (HH36), and E27 (HH38). For the zebra finch, these stages were E4.5 (HH23), E5.5 (HH27) E6.5 (HH29), E7.5 (HH 32), and E9.5 (HH38). As early emu gonadal development has not been previously reported, we first assessed the timing of gonadal sex differentiation in this species using standard histology. For all species, tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C overnight. Tissues were pooled by sex (three per sex per stage) dehydrated in a methanol series and stored up to 1 week before further processing. Tissues were then rehydrated to PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 before digestion in proteinase K (1 µg/mL in PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 to 90 minutes at room temperature depending on tissue size). Tissues were then washed, briefly refixed, and preincubated for 3 hours to overnight at 65°C in (pre)hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× standard saline citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate, 5 mM EDTA, 50 µg/mL heparin, 1 mg/mL yeast RNA, 2% blocking powder). Digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probes were synthesized using a digoxigenin labeling kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Life Technologies). The RNA probes for chicken HINTW, FET1, AROMATASE, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), and FOXL2 have been described previously (38, 41, 43, 51). For FAF, a 231-bp putative open reading frame was cloned from gonadal complementary DNA (cDNA), using primers listed in Table 1. All DNA sequences were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector and sequences were confirmed before use. For probe generation, a DNA template was first generated by PCR amplification of the insert, using M13 forward and reverse primers, encompassing RNA polymerase binding sites. Antisense and sense digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes were generated using the relevant T3, T7, or SP6 RNA polymerase sites present in the amplified PCR product. Primers used for generating Riboprobes in the zebra finch and emu are shown in Table 1. For the zebra finch, published sequences were used. For the emu, prepublication sequence data were obtained from a ratite genome sequencing initiative (P. Grayson, T. Sackton, and S. Edwards, in preparation). For both the zebra finch and emu, probes spanning exons were derived from genomic DNA and confirmed by Sanger sequencing.Antibodies Used in This StudyAbbreviation: RRID, Research Resource Identifier.Following synthesis, Riboprobes were precipitated at −20°C and resuspended in 100 μL of RNAse-free water prior to addition to (pre)hybridization mix. For each probe, 5 μL was added to 2 mL (pre)hybridization mix. Probe hybridization was carried out overnight at 65°C. Following low and high stringency washes in solution I (50% formamide, 5× standard saline citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) tissues were washed in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (TBTX), preblocked, and then incubated overnight at 4°C with alkaline phosphatase–conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibodies in TBTX (1:2000; Roche). Following extensive washing in TBTX, tissues were exposed to chromogen for up to 4 hours [nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 50 mM MgCl2, and 0.1% Tween 20 (NTMT) buffer]. For each gene, the color reaction was stopped at the same time by rinsing in NTMT buffer, followed by washing in PBS and imaging. Tissues were then overstained and subjected to cryosectioning to visualize messenger RNA (mRNA) localization with the gonad. Stained and imaged specimens were first transferred back into NTMT for 30 minutes and then back into the color reaction (during 2 days with rocking at room temperature). Tissues were cryoprotected in PBS plus 30% sucrose, snap frozen in OCT embedding compound, and sectioned at 14 or 18 μm.Total RNA was extracted from paired E9.5 (HH36) embryonic chicken gonads using TRIzol, as per the manufacturer’s instructions. All RNA samples were treated with DNase I using the Ambion DNA-free kit. One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexamers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcription (Promega). To generate biological replicates, cDNA was produced from two individuals for each variable (sex and aromatase inhibition). Quantitative real-time PCR was then performed on triplicate samples using gene-specific primers and Power SYBR master mix (Applied Biosystems). For each primer set, standard curves were constructed to confirm amplification efficiency (90% to 110%). All samples were normalized against β-ACTIN housekeeping gene, using the comparative cycle threshold method. Control samples not exposed to reverse transcriptase showed no PCR amplification. Data were plotted as relative expression, normalized to the PBS-treated control female samples (set at 100%). Data were analyzed using unpaired t tests and two-tailed P values (GraphPad Prism). The quantitative real-time PCR primers are listed in Table 1.A 16–amino acid N-terminal region unique to the predicted HINTW protein (not present in HINTZ) was linked to carrier (keyhole limpet hemocyanin), mixed with adjuvant, and used to immunize two rabbits (Mimotopes and the Institute of Medical Veterinary Science, Adelaide) (Table 2). The amino acid sequence used was: AGGIVRSPAAWRGGAAC. Following confirmation of immune response by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, antisera was purified via affinity chromatography. Immunofluorescence was performed on paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of embryonic chicken gonads and, as positive control, on DF1 cells overexpressing HINTW. For overexpression in vitro, chicken DF1 cells were transiently transfected for 48 hours with 500 ng with pCMV-FLAG-HINTW. Antibody immunostaining was carried out to detect the FLAG tag and the HINTW protein. For positive controls on the gonadal tissue, previously validated aromatase (female) and SOX9 (male) antibodies were used.To assess the role of the candidate ovary determinants (HINTW, FET1, and FAF) in the chicken embryo, WISH was used to define expression during normal development, and both WISH and qRT-PCR were used to examine expression following female-to-male sex reversal. All three genes showed female-enriched expression during gonadal sex differentiation, whereas none showed altered expression following sex reversal. Additionally, in the zebra finch, HINTW, but not FET1 or FAF, was expressed in the embryonic gonads. Meanwhile, a differentiated HINTW gene is not present in the genome of the emu, a ratite bird (P. Grayson, T. Sackton, and S. Edwards, unpublished data). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that none of these W-linked genes is a universal female (ovary) determinant in avians. In contrast, Z-linked DMRT1, but not the recently identified HEMGN gene, was male upregulated in both emu and zebra finch embryos.HINTW mRNA expression was detected in female but not male embryonic chicken gonads before (E4.5; HH 26), during (E6.5; HH30), and after (E9.5; HH36) the period of gonadal sex differentiation [Fig. 1(a)]. Sectioned whole mounts showed an expression pattern that was biased toward the outer cortical zone of the developing ovary [Fig. 1(b)]. There was little if any expression in the mesonephros (embryonic kidney). Similarly, FAF was expressed in female but not male gonads before, during, and after the onset of gonadal sex differentiation [Fig. 2(a)]. Sectioned whole mounts showed that FAF mRNA was located in the outer cortical zone of the female gonad, as for HINTW, most notably at E4.5 [Fig. 2(b)]. In the case of FET1, mRNA was localized in the gonads of female embryos from E4.5. Initially, expression was asymmetric, only detectable in the left gonad, but expression became symmetrical after E4.5 [Fig. 3(a)]. Contrary to previous a report (32), we also detected weak FET1 expression in male gonads, but only in the left gonad [Fig. 3(a)]. Within the gonad, FET1 expression was biased to the cortex of female gonads at early stages and became restricted to the left cortex by E9.5 [Fig. 3(b)]. In males, FET1 mRNA expression was clearly also restricted to the gonadal cortex, which in males regresses to a thin layer of epithelia [Fig. 3(b)]. These expression patterns of HINTW, FAF, and FET1 make it less likely that they have a direct role in ovary determination, because their putative products are intracellular, and key sex genes such as FOXL2 and aromatase are expressed not in the ovarian cortex, but in the underlying medulla. Zebra finch gonads were tested for HINTW, FET1, and FAF expression. Whereas HINTW was expressed in zebra finch gonads, FAF and FET1 were not expressed (not shown). For the emu, differentiated HINTW, FAF, and FET1 are not present in the genome. HINTZ (HINT1) is present in the emu in the pseudoautosomal region.(a) Time course of HINTW mRNA expression in embryonic chicken gonads, as assessed by whole mount in situ hybridization. The gene is expressed in female but not male gonads, as early as E4.5 (HH 25) (arrows). Some expression is also detected in the female mesonephros. (b) Sectioned whole mounts show cortical (C) and juxtacortical staining with less staining in the medulla (M) in the developing ovary.(a) Time course of FAF mRNA expression in embryonic chicken gonads. The gene is expressed in female but not male gonads. (b) In tissue sections, expression is detectable throughout the ZW gonad, but is concentrated in the cortex. (c) The weak staining in male sections is background.(a) Time course of FET1 expression in embryonic chicken gonads. The gene is initially expressed asymmetrically, only in the left gonad, of both males and females (arrows). As development proceeds, expression is detected in both left and right gonads in females, but only in the left gonad of males. (b) Sectioned whole mounts show expression localized to the gonadal cortex (C). M, medulla.Aromatase enzyme expression is essential for ovarian differentiation in birds. Inhibition of the aromatase enzyme with a single injection of the specific inhibitor FAD is sufficient to induce masculinization and male development (49). ZW embryos subjected to a single dose of the aromatase inhibitor FAD fail to develop ovaries. Instead, the left gonad becomes an “ovotestis” that fails to elaborate a thickened cortex, whereas the right gonad becomes testicular. Fig. 4 shows gonadal histology of E9.5 (HH36) ZW and ZZ embryos treated with FAD at E3.5 (HH19). In control female (ZW) embryos treated with vehicle (PBS), the left gonad was an ovary, characterized by a thickened outer cortex harboring germ cells, and underlying medulla with diagnostic lacunae (fluid-filled cavities) (Fig. 4). The right gonad was undergoing regression in control females, characterized by its smaller size, thin outer epithelial layer (lack of an ovarian cortex). In control males (ZZ), the paired testes are rounded structures in transverse section, with a thin epithelial cell layer covering a medulla with well-developed seminiferous cords. The cords comprise Sertoli cells and mitotically arrested germ cells. Males showed the same testicular structure after FAD treatment. In genetically female embryos (ZW) treated with FAD, the left gonad failed to develop a cortex and showed signs of seminiferous cord formation in the medulla, whereas the right gonad was more fully masculinized, with somatic and germ cells arranged into cords and with no lacunae present (Fig. 4).Histology of E9.5 (HH35) embryonic chicken gonads subjected to experimental sex reversal with the aromatase inhibitor FAD. In control embryos injected with PBS vehicle, a left ovary develops in females (ZW), characterized by a thickened cortex of stratified epithelium harboring germ cells (asterisks), whereas the underlying medulla has lacunae (holes) (l). The smaller right female gonad of PBS controls does not develop a thickened outer cortex. In both control males treated with PBS and in FAD-treated males, the outer layer is reduced to an epithelial monolayer and seminiferous cords develop in the medulla. These cords enclose mitotically arresting germ cells. In female embryos treated with FAD, the left (L) and right (R) gonads fail to form a stratified cortex, whereas seminiferous-like cords enclosing germ cells (asterisks) develop in the medulla.During masculinization due to FAD treatment, key genes involved in ovary vs testis formation show altered expression patterns. Previous studies have shown that genes involved in ovarian development are downregulated during sex reversal, whereas genes involved in testis development are upregulated, including genes that are ordinarily expressed prior to aromatase (48, 50). In ZW embryos treated with FAD, Aromatase mRNA expression was substantially suppressed, as expected [Fig. 5(a) and 5(b)]. In FAD-treated ZW gonads, the key FOXL2 gene was downregulated during masculinization [Fig. 5(c) and 5(d)]. Conversely, the male-associated gene AMH showed robust upregulated expression after early FAD treatment in ZW embryos [Fig. 5(e) and 5(f)]. However, HINTW, FET1, and FAF mRNA expression patterns were unaltered following FAD treatment, as assessed by both WISH and qRT-PCR (Fig. 6).Effect of the FAD treatment on expression of key gonadal sex differentiation markers. In situ hybridization of E9.5 (HH35) chicken urogenital systems, FAD- vs PBS-treated controls. FAD-treated ZW gonads had a greatly reduced level of aromatase expression, as seen in both whole mounts and sectioned gonads. Gonadal morphology was masculinized with a more bilateral male-like shape and a loss of typical female asymmetry. ZW gonads treated with FAD also showed a downregulation of the female marker FOXL2 and upregulation of the male marker AMH compared with PBS-treated controls. In the case of AMH, expression in FAD-treated females reflected the arrangement of seminiferous cords, as in control males.Effect of FAD treatment on the expression of candidate ovary determinants HINTW, FET1, and FAF. WISH of embryonic chicken urogenital systems and qRT-PCR at E9.5 (HH 35) are shown.

(a–f) Unpaired t test: P > 0.05. NS, not significant.Among the candidate ovary determinants on the avian W sex chromosome, HINTW has been the prime contender, owing to its conservation in all neognath birds, its positive selection over evolution, and its divergence from a Z homolog that would predict a loss of function (37, 39, 61–63). We raised an antibody against the predicted HINTW protein and tested it in vitro on forced overexpression of predicted HINTW peptide. In chicken DF1 cells, anti-HINTW recognized the overexpressed protein, as assessed by immunofluorescence [Fig. 7(a) and 7(b)]. Staining was cytoplasmic, as might be expected of a putative enzyme. However, the same antibody could not detect an endogenous HINTW protein in the gonads by immunofluorescence [Fig. 7(c)]. This is unlikely to be due to the immunofluorescence methodology, as the overexpressed protein could be detected in vitro. This suggests that the HINTW mRNA is not translated into a functional protein in vivo. Additionally, whereas an HINTW mRNA could be detected in female but not male embryonic zebra finch gonads (Fig. 8), the gene is absent from the emu genome, excluding it as a universal avian sex determinant.Immunofluorescence for predicted HINTW protein. (a) Detection of HINTW protein in chicken DF1 cells transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged overexpression construct. Expression of FLAG and HINTW can be detected in the same cells.

E8.5 (HH34) gonads are shown.Expression of HINTW mRNA in female (ZW) but not male (ZZ) embryonic zebra finch urogenital systems. As reported previously in the chicken, the gene is expressed ubiquitously in both the mesonephros and gonads of female zebra finch embryos.The chicken belongs to the Galloanserae clade of birds. There is currently no information regarding candidate avian sex determinants in other avian species beyond this clade. To test the degree of conservation among birds more broadly, gonadal sex differentiation was examined in the emu and zebra finch, representing the two other major clades of birds (Paleognathae and Neoaves, respectively) (64). Similar to all other birds, the emu has ZZ male/ZW female sex chromosomes; however, the two are largely homomorphic. Although the emu has a lengthened period of embryogenesis relative to the chicken, early developmental stages are similar between the two species (57). Interestingly, embryonic emu gonads showed marked asymmetry in both sexes, with the developing testes of males appearing morphologically more like the ovaries of female chickens (Supplemental Fig. 1). Histologically, gonadal sex differentiation in the emu occurred over similar developmental stages to those reported in the chicken. Thus, at HH30 (day 16 in the emu), the gonads of male (ZZ) embryos showed evidence of condensing seminiferous cords, with pre-Sertoli cells containing large amounts of cytoplasm and medullary-located primordial germ cells. Meanwhile, in females (ZW), the left gonad was developing a thickened outer cortex with germ cells, whereas the right gonad had a thinner outer layer [Fig. 9(a)]. There were no histological signs of sexual differentiation prior to this time point. By HH35, these sexually dimorphic features were more pronounced and by HH38 (day 27), the gonads were clearly well developed testes (ZZ) or unilateral ovaries (ZW) [Fig. 9(a)]. Using an antibody directed against chicken DMRT1 protein, specific staining was detectable by immunoperoxidase in male Sertoli cells, and weaker staining in females [Fig. 9(b)]. Expression of DMRT1 was then more closely examined by whole mount in situ hybridization, using an emu-specific Riboprobe.Gonadal sex differentiation in the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae). (a) Low and high magnification images of embryonic emu gonads are shown (boxed area corresponds to the area magnified). At HH30 (day 16) the male gonad shows signs of condensing pre-Sertoli cells in the medulla (high cytoplasmic/nuclear ratio), whereas the left cortex of females (ZW) thickens and accumulates germ cells. By HH35 (day 21) seminiferous cords are apparent in males (demarcated by dotted lines), whereas the cortex is thickened in the left gonad of females. In both left and right female gonads, lacunae (cavities) appear in the medulla. By HH38 (day 27) testes were well developed in males and a left unilateral ovary was present in females. The right gonad of females did not show a thickened cortex with germ cells. C, cortex; L, lacuna; M, medulla. (b) Immunohistochemical localization of DMRT1 protein in HH35 (male) or HH36 (female) embryonic emu gonads. The protein localizes to the nuclei of Sertoli cells in males and is more lowly expressed in the cords of females. (a and b) Asterisks show germ cells.Emu DMRT1 mRNA was detected in the embryonic gonads, with higher expression observed in males (ZZ) [Fig. 10(a)]. Expression was detectable prior to the onset of gonadal sex differentiation, as in the chicken. Sectioned whole mounts showed DMRT1 expression in the developing seminiferous cords of males, and in the medullary cords of females [Fig. 10(b)], as has been reported in the chicken. In male gonads, emu DMRT1 expression preceded that of male-specific SOX9. As in the chicken, emu FOXL2 and SOX9 were expressed exclusively in female and male gonads, respectively [Fig. 10(d)]. Male-enriched DMRT1 expression was also detected in the embryonic gonads of the zebra finch [Fig. 11(a)], a member of the Neoaves that has well-differentiated Z and W sex chromosomes. In the zebra finch, very little DMRT1 mRNA could be detected in female gonads. As in the emu and chicken, zebra finch SOX9 was expressed in the gonads after the onset of DMRT1 expression. Likewise, FOXL2 expression was detected in female gonads [Fig. 11(b)].(a) Expression of DMRT1 mRNA in embryonic emu gonads prior to (HH26), during (HH29) and after (HH32) the onset of gonadal sex differentiation. High expression is detected in males (ZZ) and weaker expression females.

M, medulla.The hematopoietic transcription factor HEMGN was identified in 2013 as a novel Z-encoded factor that is male upregulated during chicken gonadal sex differentiation. Overexpression of this gene was shown to induce masculinization (downregulation of FOXL2 mRNA and upregulation of both DMRT1 and SOX9), pointing to a role in testis formation (29). In both the emu and zebra finch, HEMGN mRNA expression could not be detected in the gonads by WISH, using species-specific Riboprobes [Fig. 12(a) and 12(b)]. To verify this result, qRT-PCR was carried out on E6.7.5 (HH32) zebra finch gonadal cDNA. Although HEMGN mRNA could be detected in the blood (as expected), expression in the gonads was very low by comparison [Fig. 13(a)]. When the gonads were assessed separately, expression was very low and not sexually dimorphic. In chicken controls, HEMGN was male upregulated by E8.5 (HH32) (i.e., same stage as the zebra finch at E6.5, as zebra finch development is advanced compared with chicken). In the chicken, DMRT1 and Aromatase mRNA were male and female enriched, as expected [Fig. 13(b)].Lack of detectable HEMGN mRNA expression in emu and zebra finch gonads, as assessed by in situ hybridization. Chicken control shows strong expression in male gonads and weaker expression in females.qRT-PCR analysis of gene expression in embryonic zebra finch and chicken gonads. (a) Zebra finch HEMGN expression in E6.5 (HH32) gonads and blood. High expression is present in blood of both sexes, but very low expression in the gonads. When gonads ere analyzed separately, expression of HEMGN mRNA at E6.5 (HH32) is not sexually dimorphic. (b) High level of HEMGN expression blood but low level expression in chicken embryonic gonads at E8.5 (HH32). When analyzed separately, expression was higher in male gonads but not statistically significant. At E8.5, HEMGN is more highly expressed in male vs female chicken gonads. Chicken control genes for the qRT-PCR showed male (M) and female (F) upregulation of DMRT1 and Aromatase, respectively. n = 3; mean ± standard error of the mean; un-paired t test; *P < 0.5. NS, not signficant; UGS, urogenital system.The data presented in this study do not support the hypothesis that HINTW, FET1, or FAF play decisive roles in avian gonadal development. Expression patterns for these genes did not change during testicular development in ZW (sex-reversed) females. This was evident by WISH of E9.5 urogenital systems and qRT-PCR. All three genes maintained high female-type expression levels, which were compatible with testicular differentiation. Expression of the key female gene, FOXL2, declines during sex reversal (Fig. 5) (51), despite elevated HINTW, FET1, and FAF expression, suggesting no functional link between these W candidates and the ovarian developmental pathway.Estrogen has a pervasive effect on genes involved in chicken ovarian development. It has been shown previously that inhibition of aromatase and induction of testis development in ZW embryos is accompanied by a sharp decline in female pathway gene expression. This occurs even for those genes that express prior to Aromatase but maintain expression during the course of ovarian development. These genes include WNT4, R-SPO1, and FOXL2 (51, 65). It is assumed based on these findings that these genes are both upstream and downstream of estrogen signaling. Similarly, in the present study, we hypothesized that candidate female determinants, HINTW, FET1, and FAF, which as expressed throughout ovarian development would lie both upstream and downstream of aromatase. Hence, they should be downregulated upon FAD treatment if they are important for female gonadal sex differentiation. None of these genes showed such downregulation upon masculinization, despite downregulation of FOXL2 and masculinization (Fig. 5). This undermines all three of these genes as having a decisive role in avian gonadal sex differentiation.In contrast to a previous report (41), we found that a highly homologous FET1-related sequence is also expressed in male embryonic chicken gonads, albeit at low levels. At E4.5 (HH25) a FET1 mRNA was expressed asymmetrically in both male and female gonads (Fig. 3). Expression in males (ZZ) is consistent with sequence data from the most recent build of the chicken genome (Gallus_gallus-5.0/galGla5), which indicates that a Z-linked homolog of FET1 exists (4). This Z-linked sequence has 93% identity to W-linked FET1 at the DNA level and is predicted to be detected with the FET1 open reading frame Riboprobe used in the present study. This decreases the likelihood that FET1 has a role in chicken ovarian development. Indeed, there are several other highly related FET1 sequences in the chicken genome (on chicken chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 20, for example), all with >90% DNA sequence identity to the W-linked sequence. FET1-related sequences appear to be absent from the W chromosome of the turkey, a galliform bird closely related to the chicken (several autosomal sequences are present) (66). FET1-related sequences are completely absent from the genomes of those passerine birds that have been sequenced (ZW medium ground finch, ZZ zebra finch, ZZ budgerigar) and also from the ratites (ZW kiwi and ZZ emu). At the predicted protein level, chicken FET1 shows some homology to avian syncytin-1. Syncytins are peptides derived from the envelope protein of endogenous retroviral elements that have been captured by the genome and co-opted into developmental pathways. In mammals, syncytin has a role in placentation and myoblast fusion during muscle development (67, 68). Hence, FET1 may have a developmental role in the embryonic gonads of chickens specifically, but not a decisive sex-determining function across avians. Indeed, the avian gonad appears to be particularly susceptible to co-opted expression of retroviral-type elements, and there is a concentration of retroviral elements on the W sex chromosome (2). The conserved co-opted endogenous retrovirus OVEX1 has a very similar expression pattern to FET1, being expressed asymmetrically in early embryonic chicken gonads, and later more strongly in females (69). However, recent studies show the gene to be ubiquitously expressed in chicken tissues (70). Collectively, the data rule out FET1 as a universal avian female sex determinant.The gonadal expression pattern of FAF has not previously been reported. In this study, we show that the gene is expressed in female but not male embryonic chicken gonads (but not in the zebra finch). Analysis of the chicken W chromosome indicates that FAF is apparently the only W-linked sequence that lacks a Z gametolog (1). However, this sequence is absent outside the Galliformes (e.g., chickens, quail, turkey). Among palaoegnath birds (the flightless ratites and the tinamous), we have found that it is not present in the female southern cassowary genome, nor are there any related sequences present in emu, kiwi, rhea, or tinamou genomes (T. Sackton et al., manuscript in preparation) (71). These observations, together with the unaltered expression of FAF following sex reversal, indicate that the gene is not a universal avian ovary determinant.HINTW is W linked in all Neognathae, and it remains the most likely avian sex determinant under the dominant W hypothesis. The putative protein encodes a divergent histidine triad nucleotide binding factor/hydrolase enzyme. A bona fide HINT gene, HINTZ, is present on the chicken Z sex chromosome. Chicken HINTW and HINTZ have diverged in sequence so that HINTZ shows only 65% amino acid identity to its W-linked gametolog (37). The predicted HINTZ protein encodes a nucleotide binding protein that acts as an enzyme to hydrolase adenosine 5′-monophosphate at lysine residues (72). Divergence between the Z and W copies is high precisely within the catalytic domain, and HINTW appears to have undergone positive adaptive selection (61, 62). It has been shown experimentally that, in vitro, overexpressed HINTW can bind and interfere with HINTZ function (63, 73). It has hence been hypothesized that HINTW may act as a dominant negative in avian sex determination, blocking a male-promoting function of HINTZ (37, 39, 44, 74). However, despite these findings, overexpression of HINTW does not induce feminization of ZZ chicken embryos (75). One caveat associated with the overexpression study was that functional protein was not demonstrated, owing to the lack of an HINTW-specific antibody at the time, and it is also possible that overexpressed HINTW was insufficient to antagonize the high levels of endogenous HINTZ expression in males. In this study, we found that experimental female-to-male sex reversal does not affect the high expression level of HINTW RNA. Hence, high levels of HINTW expression were maintained despite masculinization of ZW gonads following FAD treatment. Whereas an HINTW mRNA could be detected in embryonic zebra finch as well as chicken gonads (Fig. 8), no homolog appears to be present in the emu. Furthermore, a novel HINTW antibody, validated in vitro, failed to detect an endogenous HINTW protein in embryonic chicken gonads. Taken together, these data undermine HINTW as a universal avian ovary determinant. The role, then, of this sequence in the avian genome remains unclear.It is possible that another W-linked gene in the chicken governs ovarian development in birds. However, sequencing of both the embryonic W transcriptome and the chromosome itself have failed to produce any further likely candidates (1, 3, 36, 76, 77). The W sex chromosome in most birds has undergone substantial degradation during evolution (2, 3, 7, 78). The chicken W harbors ∼27 bona fide genes, but there is no good evidence for female-specific functional differentiation for any of these genes. We have previously reported that essentially all of these genes have partners on the Z sex chromosome, to which they are highly homologous (>90% in most cases) (1). In the chicken and the collared flycatcher, the combined expression levels of the Z and W gametologs in females are comparable to the expression levels from the two Z chromosomes in males, and expression occurs broadly across embryonic and/or adult tissues (1, 2). These features make them unlikely gonadal sex determinants. Bellott et al. (3) recently sequenced the euchromatic region of the chicken W sex chromosome, and they came to the conclusion that the avian W does not harbor genes specifically associated with (female) reproduction but, rather, retains a small set of W-linked genes that are dosage sensitive, essential for viability of heterogametic sex and that have therefore not undergone degradation. This contrasts with the heterogametic sex in mammals (male), where the Y chromosome has accumulated male advantage genes, including the testis-determining SRY gene. In birds, genes associated with sex and reproduction appear to have accumulated not on the W but the Z, and may be important for males (77).Recently, Zhou et al. (7) described the evolutionary history of the Z and W sex chromosomes across multiple avian taxa. As in mammals, avian Z and W sex chromosomes have evolved through suppression of recombination in a series of punctuated events, so that evolutionary strata can be recognized. According to sex chromosome theory, suppression of recombination occurs following the emergence and fixation of a major sexually advantageous/sex-determining locus on one of the proto-sex chromosomes. The likely master avian sex determinant, DMRT1, is conserved on the oldest evolutionary stratum identified by Zhou et al. (7) (stratum 0), retained in all taxa, including the flightless ratites (e.g., emu, ostrich), which have minimal Z/W divergence compared with other birds. Almost no W-linked genes were identified within the orthologous region of S0 in all 17 avian species studied (7). Taken together with the reassessment of candidate W genes reported in this study, the most likely universal mechanism of avian sex determination remains dosage of Z-linked DMRT1. To test for universality among avians, we examined expression of DMRT1 and other candidate gonadal sex differentiation genes in the two other bird clades, Neoaves (zebra finch) and Paleognaths (emu). This study presents a description of such gene expression beyond the Galloanserae. DMRT1 was upregulated male specifically in both species, prior to the onset of histological differentiation and prior to SOX9 mRNA expression (Figs. 9 and 10). In sectioned whole mounts in situ, DMRT1 was localized in developing seminiferous cords, as expected. These data support a conserved role for male-enriched DMRT1 in regulating testicular differentiation across all birds.Most recently, another Z-linked gene has been implicated in testicular differentiation in the chicken embryo, HEMGN. This gene encodes a transcription factor that is expressed in hematopoietic (blood) cells and is also male upregulated in the gonads (28, 29). Gonadal HEMGN expression is first detected at day 5.5 to 6.5. As this appears to be after the onset of DMRT1 expression at day 4.5, it has been suggested that HEMGN lies downstream of DMRT1 in the chicken testis determination pathway. Interestingly, overexpression of HEMGN in embryonic female chicken gonads causes upregulation of DMRT1 and masculinization. This suggests an interaction between DMRT1 and HEMGN, and possibly that HEMGN could actually function upstream of DMRT1 in the chicken. If so, a sex-linked mechanism would need to exist to repress HEMGN expression in females, yet we find no evidence for a W-linked ovary determinant in the chicken. Interestingly, we failed to detect significant sexually dimorphic expression of HEMGN in the embryonic gonads of either the zebra finch or emu (Figs. 12 and 13). This suggests that a role of this gene in gonadal sex differentiation could be limited to the chicken and other members of the Galloanserae.In our previous studies, we reported that knockdown of DMRT1 resulted in feminization of embryonic ZZ chicken gonads (5). However, the nature of that knockdown meant that the level of DMRT1 mRNA reduction could not be precisely controlled, and knockdown was not always robust. To prove that DMRT1 gene dosage is key to avian gonadal sex differentiation, deletion of one copy via genome editing is required.anti-Müllerian hormonecomplementary DNAembryonic dayfadrozolefemale-associated factorfemale-expressed transcript 1hemogenHamburger and Hamilton stagemessenger RNA100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 50 mM MgCl2, and 0.1% Tween 20phosphate-buffered salinepolymerase chain reactionquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100whole-mount in situ hybridization.Immunostaining was carried out with the assistance of the Monash University Histology Platform.

This is in large part because most amphibian taxa have homomorphic sex chromosomes, which has traditionally made it challenging to identify discordance between phenotypic and genetic sex in amphibians, despite all amphibians having a genetic component to sex determination. Recent advances in molecular techniques such as genome complexity reduction and high throughput sequencing present a valuable avenue for furthering our understanding of sex determination in amphibians and other taxa with homomorphic sex chromosomes like many fish and reptiles.We use DArTseq as a novel approach to identify sex-linked markers in the North American green frog (Rana clamitans melanota) using lab-reared tadpoles as well as wild-caught adults from seven ponds either in undeveloped, forested habitats or suburban ponds known to be subject to contamination by anthropogenic chemicals. The DArTseq methodology identified 13 sex-linked SNP loci and eight presence-absence loci associated with males, indicating an XX-XY system. Both alleles from a single locus show partial high sequence homology to Dmrt1, a gene linked to sex determination and differentiation throughout Metazoa. Two other loci have sequence similarities to regions of the chimpanzee and human X-chromosome as well as the chicken Z-chromosome. Several loci also show geographic variation in sex-linkage, possibly indicating sex chromosome recombination. While all loci are statistically sex-linked, they show varying degrees of female heterozygosity and male homozygosity, providing further evidence that some markers are on regions of the sex chromosomes undergoing higher rates of recombination and therefore further apart from the putative sex determining locus.The ease of the DArTseq platform provides a useful avenue for future research on sex reversal and sex chromosome evolution in vertebrates, particularly for non-model species with homomorphic or cryptic or nascent sex chromosomes.Sex determination and environmental influences on sexual differentiation in amphibians are long-standing interests of biologists for over a century [1–3]. To date, all amphibians are known to have genotypic sex determination (GSD), although the mode of sex determination (i.e., XX-XY or ZZ-ZW) has repeatedly switched throughout amphibian evolutionary history [4, 5]. Some amphibian species even show substantial geographic variation in sex determining modes [2, 6–9]. Despite GSD, numerous laboratory experiments show that amphibian sexual differentiation is sensitive to environmental factors such as temperature [10, 11] or chemical exposure [12, 13]. Taxa with GSD and which are subject to environmental effects on sexual differentiation can exhibit sex reversal, whereby the genotypic sex does not match the phenotypic sex [14]. Often, sex reversal is inferred in laboratory experiments by sex ratio biases [12, 15, 16]. Recently, some studies been able to provide evidence of discordance between sexual genotype and phenotype in response to environmental factors like the pesticide atrazine [13] or the synthetic estrogen 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2) [3].While laboratory evidence of sex reversal is sparse, there is a deeper dearth of evidence demonstrating sex reversal in wild populations. To our knowledge, only one study has shown sex reversal in a wild amphibian population. An analysis of three sex-linked microsatellites in the European common frog (Rana temporaria) showed that ~10 % of genotypic females had a male phenotype in a single area [14]. However, the environmental context, natural or anthropogenically-impacted, was not discussed. Recent evidence shows that green frog (Rana = Lithobates clamitans melanota) sex ratios are male-biased at metamorphosis in undeveloped, forested ponds and become more feminized as ponds become increasingly surrounded by residential suburban land use [16]. Green frog populations in suburban ponds also exhibit high frequencies of feminized testes, a condition that is absent in forested ponds [17, 18]. Feminized testes are also common in R. clamitans from agricultural areas [19]. Whether sex ratio variation and feminized testes are due to sex reversal in this species is currently unknown and requires sex-linked molecular markers for understanding underlying molecular mechanisms as well as mechanisms of sex reversal. However, ascertaining the genetic sex of most amphibian taxa is challenging at the chromosomal level as most taxa have homomorphic sex chromosomes [20].Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) has been proposed as a method for developing sex-linked markers in taxa with homomorphic sex chromosomes [21] and has successfully been used to develop sex-linked markers and infer the sex determining mode for several squamate and fish species [21–24]. Recently RADseq has been used to study sex determination in two European anuran species, including an individual family for the European tree frog (Hyla arborea) [25] as well as R. temporaria [26]. While a linkage map using RADseq produced single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) elucidating the sex chromosomes in H. arborea [25], no sex-linked SNPs were identified in the R. temporaria from Switzerland [26]. One reason for not discovering any sex-linked markers might have been due to the limited genetic diversity used in the analysis [26].Here, we use DArTseq™ (Diversity Arrays Technology) which employs a combination of genome complexity reduction and next generation sequencing [27] similar to RADseq [28] or genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) methods [29]. Our primary goal was to develop a series of markers that are sex-linked in R. clamitans, a species putatively experiencing sex reversal in the wild. Rather than constructing linkage maps from a single mating, we performed DArTseq on lab-reared tadpoles from several clutches as well as a diversity of wild-caught adults from multiple populations and across a land use gradient.The range of R. clamitans occupies much of eastern North America, extending from north Florida into southeastern Canada (Fig. 1a); our sampling was located in Connecticut, a state in the northeastern United States (Fig. 1a, b). We used two developmental stages: tadpoles reared to sexual differentiation in controlled-environment mesocosms and wild-caught adults. We predict that tadpoles reared in carefully constructed mesocosms should experience minimal sex reversal, maximizing the probability of genotype-phenotype concordance [30]. We collected portions of freshly-laid clutches from three ponds (1 from Septic7, 3 from Forest5, and 2 from Forest6; Fig. 1b), hatched the embryos in the lab at 19 °C on a 12L: 12D cycle, and reared tadpoles in outdoor mesocosms. We did not use any leaf litter to our mesocosms as leaf leachate has been shown to influence sex steroid pathways [31]. Tadpoles of this species can often be sexed within a few months of hatching despite taking over a year to metamorphose [32]. At ~4 months old, we euthanized tadpoles, sexed them under a dissecting microscope, and collected tail muscle tissue in 90 % ethanol for genetic analysis. Not all tadpoles were fully sexually differentiated at this point and so we focused only on tadpoles with clearly differentiated testes and ovaries (Fig. 2). While not random, we selected tadpoles that had clearly sexually differentiated under controlled conditions. We used 1–3 tadpoles of each phenotypic sex from each clutch for analyses. For adults, we capitalized on Yale Peabody Museum tissues (Additional file 1: Table S1) preserved from wild-caught adults in south-central Connecticut in 2014 as well as an additional five adults from Sewer3 pond collected in 2015. These individuals made up the majority of our specimens and represented variation in local geography and human land use (Fig. 1b). While wild-caught adults may have experienced sex reversal, our goal was to test whether DArTseq could identify sex-linked markers despite the presence of possible sex-reversed individuals and whether we could identify sex-reversed individuals as outliers in our data. We used 1–5 females and 3–11 males from each pond. We used 17 samples in duplicate for sequencing quality control. The source ponds for all specimens ranged from less than 1 km to over 52 km apart (Table 1).The range (a) of R. clamitans in North America with the state of Connecticut in black.

Dark green = Forest, Black = Paved Surface, Light Green = Lawn, Red = Buildings, Orange = Miscellaneous Yard Features. Range data for R. clamitans provided by IUCNGonads of 117 day old female (a) and male (b) from the same clutch collected from pond Forest5. The left ovary and testis are in red boxes in each panel. The clutch was collected 06 July, 2015; tadpoles were reared in outdoor mesocosms, and were sampled on 31 October, 2015. O = ovary, T = testis, F = fat body, K = kidney, and L = lungDNA extractions and sequencing were performed using DArTseq™ (Diversity Arrays Technology Pty Ltd). DArTseq™ represents a combination of a DArT complexity reduction methods and next generation sequencing platforms [27]. Therefore, DArTseq™ represents a new implementation of sequencing of complexity reduced representations [33] and more recent applications of this concept on the next generation sequencing platforms [28, 29], conceptually similar to double digest RADseq. A detailed description of the DArTseq™ methodology can be found in Kilian et al. [27]. While RADseq typically yields markers 85 bp or longer (e.g., [21, 23, 24]), DArTseq™’s criteria (see below) often produce sequences 69 bp or shorter in length. Compared to other similar approaches, DArTseq™ yields a lower density of markers (10’s of thousands and up to 35,000 loci versus >800,000 loci with a GBS approach) but has substantially higher coverage and results in less missing data [34]. In addition to these advantages of DArTseq™, we chose this platform because it can directly score samples as heterozygous/homozygous at each locus with the lower density approach [34] and due to the ease of optimizing the platform for each species as well as its capacity to produce thousands of short, high quality polymorphic loci using a custom analytical pipeline [35–37]. Four methods of complexity reduction were tested in R. clamitans (data not presented) and double digestions with PstI-SphI method was selected.DNA samples were processed in digestion/ligation reactions principally as per Kilian et al. [27] but replacing a single PstI-compatible adaptor with two different adaptors corresponding to two different Restriction Enzyme (RE) overhangs. The PstI-compatible adapter was designed to include Illumina flowcell attachment sequence, sequencing primer sequence and “staggered”, varying length barcode region, similar to the sequence reported by Elshire et al. [29]. The reverse adapter contained flowcell attachment region and SphI-compatible overhang sequence. Only “mixed fragments” (PstI-SphI) were effectively amplified in 30 rounds of PCR using the following reaction conditions: 94̊ C for 1 min then 30 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 7 min. After PCR, equimolar amounts of amplification products from each sample of the 96-well microtiter plate were bulked and applied to c-Bot (Illumina) bridge PCR followed by sequencing on Illumina Hiseq2500. The sequencing (single read) was run for 77 cycles.Sequences generated from each lane were processed using proprietary DArT analytical pipelines (PL). In the primary pipeline the Fastq files were first processed to filter away poor quality sequences, such as those with reproducibility below 90 %, read depth lower than 3.5 for SNPs or 5 for presence-absence markers, and applying more stringent selection criteria to the barcode region compared to the rest of the sequence. In that way the assignments of the sequences to specific samples carried in the “barcode split” step were very reliable. No samples were dropped due to low coverage across loci but individual sequences were removed if they did not meet the above criteria. Approximately 2,500,000 sequences per barcode/sample were identified and used in marker calling. The average read depth across loci was 9.2 reads per individual per locus for reference alleles and 6.5 for SNP alleles. Finally, identical sequences were collapsed into “fastqcoll files”. The fastqcoll files were “groomed” using DArT PL’s proprietary algorithm which corrects low quality base from singleton tag into a correct base using collapsed tags with multiple members as a template. The “groomed” fastqcoll files were used in the secondary pipeline for DArT PL’s proprietary single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and SilicoDArT (presence/absence of restriction fragments in representation; PA markers) calling algorithms (DArTsoft14). For SNP calling all tags from all libraries included in the DArTsoft14 analysis are clustered using DArT PL’s C++ algorithm at the threshold distance of 3, followed by parsing of the clusters into separate SNP loci using a range of technical parameters, especially the balance of read counts for the allelic pairs. Additional selection criteria were added to the algorithm based on analysis of approximately 1000 controlled cross populations. Testing for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium of alleles in these populations facilitated selection of technical parameters to effectively discriminate true allelic variants from paralogous sequences. In addition, multiple samples were processed from DNA to allelic calls as technical replicates and scoring consistency was used as the main selection criteria for high quality/low error rate markers. Calling quality was assured by high average read depth per locus (average across all markers was over 30 reads/locus).Our goal was to isolate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and presence-absence (PA) markers that are sex-linked in R. clamitans. For SNP loci, we define the “reference allele” as the allele that was sequenced most often in our data. For sex-linked markers in an XX-XY sex determining system, reference alleles will be those found on the X-chromosome. Here, “SNP alleles” are those which show polymorphisms relative to the reference allele. In an XX-XY system, SNP alleles should be alleles associated with the Y-chromosome and, as a corollary, should be on or near the male-determining region if the allele is tightly Y-specific. Higher degrees of recombination may be expected between sex chromosomes in endothermic species with homomorphic sex chromosomes [14, 25, 38]. In an XX-XY system if the two sex chromosomes recombine, SNP alleles should occasionally appear on the X chromosome, particularly in more distal regions of the sex chromosomes [25, 39]. If this occurs, then some males might be homozygous for SNP alleles at particular loci. Because of this, females could also be heterozygous, exhibiting a copy of the SNP allele. The probability of a female being homozygous for a SNP allele is low.A previous study on inheritance patterns of an allozyme suggested an XX-XY system in R. clamitans [40]. While we assumed an XX-XY system, we also searched for loci showing a ZZ-ZW pattern. For evaluating loci associated with an XX-XY system, we targeted SNP loci that maximized female homozygosity at the reference allele, maximized male heterozygosity, and which minimized homozygosity for the SNP allele in both sexes, but particularly for females. Specifically, we kept loci where frequencies of female homozygosity for the reference allele were at least 80 %, homozygosity at the SNP allele were at most 10 %, and heterozygosity were no more than 20 %. For males, we kept loci where frequencies of homozygosity for the reference allele were at most 10 % and heterozygosity were at least 75 %. This allowed sex-linked markers to show higher degrees of SNP allele homozygosity for males if recombination were occurring. We also only included SNP loci which were sequenced for at least 90 % of each sex. For PA markers we selected loci which had restriction fragments sequenced in at least 90 % of one sex and not sequenced in at least 90 % of the other sex. For both SNP and PA markers, we analyzed tadpole and adults data separately and compared results between these groups afterwards. We took a similar but opposite approach for targeting loci with a ZZ-ZW system.To assess the genetic association between each locus and phenotypic sex, we performed Cochran-Armitage tests on the adult samples with the “independence_test” function in the R package ‘coin’. We also used Hamming Distance matrices with a custom R script to estimate how well the combined markers perform in predicting phenotypic sex. Hamming Distance calculates the number of pairwise differences between all individuals across all loci. For all sex-linked loci which met our criteria and which had statistically significant associations with phenotypic sex, we used NCBI BLAST [41] to discover homologies of sex-linked SNPs markers. Specifically, we searched the “nr” database with the default settings in NCBI’s blastn suite. We searched using both the REF and SNP alleles and only report blastn hits related to sexual development or sex determination and those with e-values of 1.5 or below.Because high-throughput sequencing provides thousands of markers, we wanted to estimate that probability that some of these markers might show random associations with sex. This could be particularly problematic if small sample sizes are used to develop markers [23]. The following formula describes the probability of a locus being sex-linked by chance.Here P is the probability that a given locus, i, is sex-linked. The probability that either a female is homozygous at a given locus or a male or heterozygous is 0.5. The number of individuals sequenced at the locus is n. After sequencing, we multiplied P by the number of high-quality SNPs produced to estimate how many SNPs were expected to exhibit a sex-linked pattern by chance. Using this calculation, we estimated the estimated number of expected sex-linked markers produced by chance across a range of sample sizes and loci for comparisons with other studies. We also estimated the number of expected random sex-linked loci for both the tadpole samples as well as the adult samples used here.Prior to filtering, we sequenced 120,829 SNP loci and additional 92,604 PA markers. After filtering, we retained 42,772 SNP loci representing 2,135,560 bp, approximately 0.2 % of R. clamitans’ genome (~11.9 pg diploid DNA content) [42]. Our filtering also yielded 27,850 PA markers, equaling 1,174,376 bp which is approximately 0.1 % of the genome. Based on our selection criteria, a total of 13 SNPs were identified to assort to males (Table 2) and these SNPs were accessioned to NCBI’s dbSNP database (NCBI accession PRJNA326426, ss# 2019323440-2019323452). For the 13 sex-linked SNP loci, the average read depth across the loci is 12.7 (range 7.2–20.6) on the reference allele and 9.0 (range 5.0–13.1) on the SNP allele. SNP locus RaclCT001 was found to be perfectly sex-linked in all stages, and if we had the linkage data, this locus might possibly be linked or almost completely linked with the sex determining locus. RaclCT002 was perfectly sex-linked in tadpoles and performed almost as well in adults with 4 % (n = 2) of males exhibiting the genotype most commonly found in females at this one locus. Nine SNP loci were independently identified in the tadpole and adult samples. Two loci were identified separately each in the tadpole samples and the adult samples (Table 2). Cochran-Armitage tests verified significant SNP allelic association with phenotypic sex for all loci (χ 2 = 33.07–74.84, all p < 9.00 e -09). Each marker was homozygous for the reference allele in females and heterozygous in males. This confirms an XX-XY sex determining system in R. clamitans as previously suggested [37].Hamming’s Distances calculating pairwise differences between all 13 SNP loci (Fig. 3) for all adults showed that females are on average 21 % dissimilar (±1.6 SE, min 14 %, max 52 %) from each other and males are on average 16 % dissimilar (±2.2 SE, min 9 %, max 49 %). A large part of this variation is due to a single female and five males (T0123777 from Sewer3 and T012338, T012340, T012373, and T012374 from Septic4). These individuals are discordant across multiple loci and, notably, many of the same loci across individuals. However, when looking at the three loci (RaclCT001, RaclCT002, RaclCT003) showing the highest degree of sex-linkage (Fig. 4), all adult females show perfect congruence between phenotypic and genotypic sex at all three loci. For males, Hamming’s Distances at the top three loci (Fig. 4) show that males are on average 6 % dissimilar (±1.0 SE, min 0.03 %, max 35 %). Using only these three loci, 91 % (n = 49) adult males show perfect congruence between phenotypic and genotypic sex at all three loci. The other 9 % (n = 5) of adult males are only discordant at only one locus (n = 2 at RaclCT002, n = 3 at RaclCT003). These three loci provide further evidence that the individuals previously mentioned which display multiple loci more commonly seen in the opposite sex are not sex-reversed but may have inherited a series of linked loci during a recombination event in a parental germ line.Hamming Distance matrix illustrating proportional differences in 13 sex-linked SNP markers across all analyzed adults. Sex-linked SNPs were originally identified in both lab-reared tadpoles and wild-caught adults. Hamming Distance calculates the number of pairwise differences among all individuals at these loci. Values closer to zero (blue) signify high similarity whereas values closer to one (yellow) are more dissimilar across the thirteen loci. Colored regions at the top and at the left correspond to source ponds. The matrix is clustered by phenotypic males and females, as indicated by symbols at the left and top. One phenotypic female is on average 52 % dissimilar from all other females, showing an ambiguous genotypic sex across the 13 loci. Similarly, four males are on average 36–49 % dissimilar from other malesHamming Distance matrix illustrating proportional differences across all analyzed adults using only the three most sex-linked SNP loci. Values closer to zero (blue) signify high similarity whereas values closer to one (yellow) are more dissimilar across the 13 loci. Colored regions at the top and at the left correspond to source ponds. At these three loci, all females show perfect concordance between genotypic and phenotypic sex. Most males also show perfect concordance between genotypic and phenotypic sex. Five males are discordant at only one of three lociEight PA markers (Table 3) also showed significant sex-linkage (Cochran-Armitage; (χ 2 = 44.42–55.46, all p < 1.05 e -11). For the PA markers, four loci met our criteria only in tadpoles and four only in adults, with no locus meeting our criteria in both life stages. All PA marker restriction fragments were characterized by their presence in male samples and absence in female samples. Hamming’s Distances (Additional file 2: Figure S1) showed that these eight PA loci in adults showed that females are on average 11 % dissimilar (±2.1 SE, min 51 %, max 5 %) from each other and males are on average 11 % dissimilar (±1.5 SE, min 0.04 %, max 64 %).BLAST analysis: Three SNP markers but no PA markers had BLAST sequence homologies (Additional file 3: Table S2) to sex-related sequences. Two SNP loci had sequence homology, as identified by our BLAST search, to sex chromosomes in other taxa including matches to chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and human X-chromosome (RaclCT006) as well as chicken (Gallus gallus) Z-chromosomes (RaclCT013). While these homologies are on hominid and bird sex chromosomes, possibly indicating conserved genomic regions important in sexual development throughout tetrapods, these sequence homologies, to our knowledge, do not have known functions. Of particular interest is locus RaclCT002, which showed the highest sex-linkage in tadpoles and second highest sex-linkage in adults. RaclCT002 exhibited sequence similarity (Additional file 3: Table S2) to Dmrt1 in three other Ranid frogs (Rana nigromaculata, Rana rugosa, and Rana chensinensis) as well as a minnow (Cyrpinodon variegatus). As a preliminary analysis, we translated RaclCT002 into an amino acid sequence using ExPASy and searched for amino acid homology with UniProt BLAST. This preliminary analysis showed 100 % homology over seven amino acids (MPKCSRC) with the DM binding domain in multiple taxa including the Japanese wrinkled frog (Rana rugosa) and the Chinese brown frog (Rana chensinensis) as well as several fishes including rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), medaka (Oryzias latipes), and zebra fish (Danio rerio).Estimating Random Sex-Linkage: Across a range of sample sizes and loci, 13–16 individuals are necessary to minimize the probability of producing less than one spurious sex-linked marker (Fig. 5, Additional file 2: Figure S2). For our 25 tadpoles, P i the probability that a single locus exhibited a sex-linked pattern by chance was 2.98 × 10−8 and, of the 42,772 loci, 0.001 are expected to spuriously showed sex-linkage, and therefore random sex-linked markers in the tadpoles is highly unlikely. However, because our tadpole samples were represented by only six clutches we also performed a more conservative analysis were P i for a sample size of 12 (one male and one female per clutch) is 2.4 × 10−4. With just a single male and female from each clutch, it is possible that approximately 10.4 loci might show spurious sex-linkage by chance. The analyses for tadpoles using either a sample size of 25 or 12 indicate that some loci may be sex-linked by chance. For the 72 adults, P i is 2.12 × 10−22 and the probability that one locus spuriously showed sex-linkage was 9.06 × 10−18. Given our sample size, this probability indicates that it is highly unlikely to identify any sex-linked markers by chance in our adult samples.The modeled number of loci that are expected to be sex-linked by chance with varying sample sizes and number of polymorphic loci assessed. Inset is the same plot but focused on the latter half of sample sizesThirteen of 42,772 SNPs showed sex-linkage in R. clamitans, two of which are perfectly sex-linked or almost perfectly aligned to phenotypic sex assignment. In addition, our analysis produced eight sex-linked markers associated with the presence or absence of restriction fragments (PA markers). These loci represent the first sex-linked DNA markers in any New World amphibian. Furthermore, all of our markers conform to an XX-XY system in R. clamitans as previously inferred through inheritance differences in a sex-linked allozyme locus [40]. Our results reinforce the usefulness of methods incorporating genome complexity reduction and high throughput sequencing, like DArTseq or RADseq, for studying sex determination and identification of sex determining modes in non-model organisms, without a-priori sequence information [23].Of particular interest is the homology RaclCT002 shows to Dmrt1. In Europe, Dmrt1is either sex-linked or likely important in sexual differentiation in several Hylidae, Rana temporaria, and Bufo viridis [43, 44]. Furthermore, Dmrt1is an important gene in sexual differentiation in the Japanese wrinkled frog (Rana rugosa), despite being autosomal [45]. Given the Dmrt family’s ubiquitous role in sex determination and differentiation throughout Metazoa [46, 47] the homology of RaclCT002 to several other Ranid Dmrt1sequences provides further support for Dmrt1is important in amphibian sex determination. However, due to the relatively short sequence length of this marker, more work is needed to fully characterize this gene and its functionality in R. clamitans.Of the 77 adults within the study, a single female and five males are consistently discordant at RaclCT003-008, RaclCT010, and RaclCT011. One explanation is that these loci are linked and lie on region of the Y-chromosome experiencing recombination with the X-chromosome, which can even frequently occur in species like humans [48]. While these loci typically diagnose sex accurately in the rest of our samples, it is important to note possible linkage might produce ambiguous genetic sexes for certain individuals. Despite this concern, these six individuals showed concordance between phenotypic and genotypic sex in at least two of the three top ranked loci. This pattern suggests that while all the identified sex-linked loci can be diagnostically useful, RaclCT001-003 may be the most reliable in cases of ambiguous sexing.The markers developed here are predominantly robust to geographic variation at the scale of up to 52 km as well as substantial land use variation among source ponds (Fig. 1). Interestingly though, tadpoles from Forest5, the northern-most pond, show no sex linkage at four SNP and four PA loci (Tables 2 and 3). No other populations show this. While we did not sample adults from Forest5 and the tadpole samples only represent two wild-collected clutches, this pattern could result from geographic variation in sex-linkage at some loci. In the European common frog, (Rana temporaria), sex-linked microsatellite markers originally developed for populations in Finland [14, 30] show decreasing levels of sex linkage with decreasing latitude in neighboring Sweden [49, 50]. While our study sites represent a much narrower geographic distribution than the latitudinal gradient in Sweden, it is possible that sex chromosome recombination or turnover [38] diminishes sex-linkage at certain loci. Given the broad range of R. clamitans across much of eastern North American (Fig. 1a), it will be necessary to explore potential geographic variation in sex-linkage across these loci.Recently, Brelsford et al. [27] failed to identify sex-linked markers using RADseq in R. temporaria, concluding the absence of genetic sex determination in the population where the parents were sampled from. However, this study was attempting to produce a linkage map and therefore only used offspring and parents from a single mating. Brelsford et al. [26] suggested sampling from a broader geographic distribution and with more genetic variation may be useful for identifying sex-linked loci. Furthermore, Brelsford et al. [44] used a GBS approach on four species of European Hylid frogs. With four males and four females of each species, they found between 17 and 54 putative sex-linked SNP loci for each species out of between 4043 and 10,211 possible polymorphic sites [41]. However, our analysis (Fig. 5, Additional file 2: Figure S2), indicates that the sample sizes used for these Hylids is likely to yield 20–40 sex-linked markers by chance. This means that many of these Hylid sex-linked markers are likely false positives, without validation. Our results suggest that GBS-type methods should target multiple individuals from a given location and should focus on multiple, disparate populations. This is particularly true in taxa like many amphibians which may be expected to undergo sex reversal [14], sex chromosome recombination [38, 51], and sex chromosome turnover [7]. Studies wishing to employ similar methods should sample 13 or more individuals with a relatively even mixture of both sexes to minimize the probabilities of false-positives, though the number of samples needed may also depend on the amount of polymorphism present in a population which will likely vary across species.Importantly, nine SNP loci were independently discovered in both the lab-reared tadpole samples as well as the wild-caught adults, increasing our confidence in these markers. Of the remaining four SNP loci, one (RaclCT005) was discovered only in adults and was possibly not discovered in tadpoles due to geographic variation at Forest5 where the locus was not sex-linked. The other marker (RaclCT011), identified only from the adult samples, was itself weakly sex-linked among the adult samples with relatively high level of female heterozygosity and lower male heterozygosity than other markers and might therefore be less reliable (Table 2). The two loci (RaclCT012, -013) found only in the tadpole samples show high levels of female heterozygosity in adults (Table 2), making them less reliable in sex identification. Our analysis indicates that these two loci may be sex-linked here by chance due to the smaller tadpole sample size and provide further support for using larger sample sizes in future studies.Sex reversal would be diagnosed by discordance between the phenotypic sex and the majority of sex-linked markers, particularly RaclCT001-003. We did not detect any clear evidence of sex reversal in our samples. This may be due to a relatively low frequency of sex reversal compared to the sample size from each source pond. In a study of sex reversal in the European common frog (R. temporaria), Alho et al. [14] used 79 adults collected over a three year period at a single site. They found that 5 % of genetic females (n = 55 total) had a male phenotype. Here we used 77 adults collected from seven populations, and all but five individuals were collected during the same year. However, the maximum number of females from any pond was five (μ = 3.6, SE = 0.5) and the maximum number of males was 11 (μ = 7.4, SE = 0.8). If sex reversal is occurring in R. clamitans, it is possible that our sample sizes at any given site were too low to detect it. A richer evaluation of sex reversal in this system must use larger sample sizes at a given population, both in adults as well as larval and metamorphosing individuals.Over the past two decades, R. clamitans has emerged as a valuable model species for the study of endocrine disruption in both field studies [16, 17, 19, 52, 53] as well as experimental research [54, 55]. In laboratory experiments with other amphibian species, only two studies have been able to show true sex reversal in response to chemicals using sex-linked markers [3, 13]. No study has yet to assess whether endocrine disruption in wild amphibians also results in sex reversal. The markers developed here will allow a more thorough investigation as to whether R. clamitans populations are experiencing sex reversal and at what frequencies.Methods, like DArTseq or RADseq, combining genome complexity reduction with high throughput sequencing, are valuable options for studying the genetic basis of sex determination, gaining direct sequence insight, and providing opportunities to discover novel genes and sequences in sex determining and sex differentiating pathways. With DArTseq we discovered the first sex-linked markers in a North American amphibian and elucidated a putative sex determining gene (Dmrt1). The number of markers developed here is impressive given the small proportion of the genome (<0.5 %) analyzed and highlights the usefulness of this approach to identifying sex-linked markers. While these markers will need to be tested throughout the R. clamitans range, they provide a novel tool for studying sex determination and sex reversal in wild populations of this species. Our approach also provides information on minimizing probabilities of detecting false-positives when planning similar future studies. DArTseq and comparable methods promise to advance our understanding of the evolution of sex determination in amphibians and vertebrates more broadly [5]. The markers we developed provide an important step in understanding patterns of sex reversal and sexual differentiation variation throughout the R. clamitans range and provide early insight into the evolution of sex determination in amphibians.Diversity Arrays Technology sequencingGenotyping-by-sequencingGenotypic sex determinationRestriction site-associated DNA sequencingSingle nucleotide polymorphismKing HD.

The production of estrogen occurs via a well-characterized steroidogenic pathway, which is a multistep process involving several enzymes, including cytochrome P450 aromatase. In chicken embryos, the aromatase gene (CYP19A1) is expressed female-specifically from the time of gonadal sex differentiation. Ectopic overexpression of aromatase in male chicken embryos induces gonadal sex reversal, and male embryos treated with estradiol become feminized; however, this is not permanent. To test whether a continuous supply of estrogen in adult chickens could induce stable male to female sex reversal, 2 transgenic male chickens overexpressing aromatase were generated using the Tol2/transposase system. These birds had robust ectopic aromatase expression, which resulted in the production of high serum levels of estradiol. Transgenic males had female-like wattle and comb growth and feathering, but they retained male weights, displayed leg spurs, and developed testes. Despite the small sample size, this data strongly suggests that high levels of circulating estrogen are insufficient to maintain a female gonadal phenotype in adult birds. Previous observations of gynandromorph birds and embryos with mixed sex chimeric gonads have highlighted the role of cell autonomous sex identity in chickens. This might imply that in the study described here, direct genetic effects of the male chromosomes largely prevailed over the hormonal profile of the aromatase transgenic birds. This data therefore support the emerging view of at least partial cell autonomous sex development in birds. However, a larger study will confirm this intriguing observation.Gonadal sex differentiation is susceptible to estrogen in egg-laying vertebrates. In chickens, estrogen is critical for normal ovarian development (1, 2) and is also important for secondary sexual characteristics such as the generally cryptic coloration of females. Manipulation of estrogen levels in the early chicken embryo can feminize genetically male (ZZ) embryos. In these birds, both gonads appear ovarian, but individuals revert to a male phenotype within one year of hatching (3, 4). Estrogen levels can also vary naturally and expression patterns of the enzymes involved in steroidogenesis determine the ratio of androgens to estrogens in developing gonads (5).Aromatase is a cytochrome P450 enzyme that irreversibly catalyzes the final step of estrogen biosynthesis. In most species aromatase expression is limited to the gonads and the brain (6). In chickens, aromatase shows female-specific expression in the gonads from the time of sex differentiation (d 6.0; stage Hamburger-Hamilton 29–30) (7, 8). Suppression of aromatase prevents estrogen synthesis and subsequent ZW female-to-male sex reversal (1). Although this results in the formation of bilateral testis capable of spermatogenesis, these birds show no difference in body weights compared with untreated females and an increasing portion show normal ovarian follicles as they age (9). We recently reported that overexpression of aromatase alone is sufficient for ovarian development in male (ZZ) embryos (10).In the current study, the effect of constitutive aromatase overexpression in sexually mature chickens was examined. This was achieved by the transgenic integration of the aromatase gene (CYP19A1) using direct transfection of primordial germ cells in ovo (11). The aim of the current study was to test whether stable overexpression of aromatase could result in a constant supply of estrogen in adult chickens and whether this could sustain lasting male to female sex reversal.The miniTol2 plasmid system used in this study was as described by Balciunas et al (see reference 13 below) and was kindly provided by Professor Stephen C. Ekker from the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (Rochester, MN). In this 2-plasmid system, 1 plasmid contained the terminal Tol2 sequences flanking a promoter sequence, aromatase open reading frame with a Simian virus 40 polyA sequence (named pTol2-CMV-Aromatase). The second plasmid contained the transposase sequence under the control of the human cytomegalovirus major immediate early (CMV IE) promoter (designated pTrans) (see Supplemental Materials and Methods).Lipofectamine 2000 CD complex were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and stage Hamburger-Hamilton 14–16 embryos were injected with 1–2 μL into the dorsal aorta. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the presence of pTol2-CMV-Aromatase in the semen of chickens grown to sexual maturity (see Supplemental Materials and Methods). Rooster 528 was mated with transgenic females carrying the Tol2-DMRT1–343T-H1 cassette, which was produced as part of a separate study (Supplemental Materials and Methods). Offspring were screened for genetic sex and the presence of the pTol2-CMV-Aromatase transgene using PCR (See supplemental Materials and Methods) and visually for the Tol2-DMRT1–343T-H1 cassette by enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) with GFsP-5 (long wavelength blue) goggles (BLS LTD). PCR using genomic DNA from whole blood was used to screen for the Tol2-CMV-Aromatase insertion (see Supplemental Materials and Methods). The chicks shown to encode the Tol2-CMV-Aromatase cassette were further analyzed by Southern blot hybridization analysis using random primed probes made from a fragment of the Tol2 or the EGFP sequence. Specific insertion sites were then determined using a PCR-based strategy (primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Table 1; see also Supplemental Materials and Methods).Aromatase qRT-PCR was carried out on cDNA prepared from chicken whole blood, using FAM-labeled TaqMan Assay Mix (CYP19A1) (Applied Biosystems). Immunofluorescence was carried out as previously described (antibodies are listed in Table 1) (12). Serum hormone measurements were made using the electrochemiluminescence assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cobas) (see Supplemental Materials and Methods).Antibody TableThe method for producing transgenic chickens in the current study employed the miniTol2 plasmid vector (11, 13). Fifty-seven eggs were injected, 23 of these hatched and a total of 13 male chicks were grown to sexual maturity. Semen was collected and tested using qRT-PCR for the presence of the miniTol transposon sequence (data not shown). Rooster 528 had the highest levels of semen miniTol DNA (0.34% transgenic) and was mated with 6 transgenic hens that encoded the Tol2-DMRT1–343T-H1 cassette, which expressed a short hairpin RNA targeting chicken DMRT1 and EGFP (our unpublished data). These crosses were originally part of a separate study that aimed to generate chickens with 2 transgenes that could synergistically drive sex reversal in male chickens. However, it was subsequently found that this short hairpin RNA did not suppress DMRT1 and had no effect on gonad morphology (Supplemental Figure 1). From these crosses, a total of 669 G1 chicks were hatched from 43 hatch groups and were screened by PCR (data not shown). In total, 351 were positive for EGFP (Tol2-DMRT1–343T-H1). Of the G1 chicks, 2 males and 1 female were positive for Tol2-CMV-Aromatase (0.45% efficiency). Male 585 from hatch group 528–12 (referred to as Tg-Arom-1) was also EGFP positive, whereas male 832 from hatch group 528–19 (Tg-Arom-2) encoded Tol2-CMV-Aromatase only (Table 2). Southern blot analysis of hatch group 528–12, along with bird 832 (Tg-Arom-2), confirmed the PCR results (see Supplemental Results for integration sites).Summary of Tg-Aromatase HatchgroupsBlood was sampled at regular intervals and was used to make cDNA and isolate serum for sex hormone analysis. Aromatase expression was measured by qRT-PCR and represented as fold change relative to ovarian tissue of hen 822 from hatch group 528–19 (33 wk of age), which is referred to as a control for several experiments throughout the study. High levels of aromatase were detected at all time points analyzed, with levels ranging from 140- to 287-fold for Tg-Arom 1, and from 35- to 862-fold for Tg-Arom 2 (Figure 1A. These data indicated that the relative levels of aromatase mRNA in blood were far greater than that of normal ovarian tissue. No aromatase was detected in the blood of any other hatch group members. Sera from Tg-Arom-1 and Tg-Arom-2, together with controls from hatch group 528–19, were then tested for levels of 17β-estradiol at 15 and 35 weeks of age (39 wk for Tg-Arom-1) (Figure 1B. Levels increased over this period for the control female, whereas the control male had very low levels at both time points tested. 17β-estradiol in both transgenic (Tg) males was up-regulated compared with the control female, particularly evident at 15 weeks (Figure 1B. Serum levels of testosterone were then tested at 15 weeks of age. Like the control female, Tg-Aromatase birds had undetectable levels of testosterone, whereas this hormone was detected for the control male (Figure 1B.Aromatase overexpression in transgenic male chickens. A, qRT-PCR was used to measure mRNA levels of aromatase in cDNA from blood taken from Tg-Aromatase chickens and hatch group controls. Aromatase expression is expressed as fold change relative to a female hatch group control (aged 33 wk). Both transgenic males had elevated blood aromatase levels throughout life. B, Serum estradiol and testosterone levels of Tg-Aromatase and control chickens. Both Tg-Aromatase males had high estradiol levels, and no testosterone was detected for either. C, External appearance of Tg-Aromatase and control chickens at 35 (39 for Tg-Arom-1) weeks of age. The top panel shows that the Tg-Aromatase birds had wattles, combs, and tail feathers (white arrowheads) that resembled the control female. The bottom panel shows spur growth (black arrowheads), which are present on both of the Tg-Aromatase birds but absent from the control female. D, Weights of Tg-Aromatase birds compared with hatchmates. The sexually dimorphic bird weights of the controls were not maintained in Tg-Aromatase birds, because the weights of both Tg-Arom-1 and Tg-Arom-2 consistently tracked closely to the control males. Error bars indicate SE.The external appearance and behavior of ZZ transgenic birds was monitored throughout development. Tg-Arom-1 and Tg-Arom-2 were overtly female in appearance, with small wattles and combs compared with control males. They also exhibited a female-type feathering pattern, most notably in their tails (Figure 1C. However, both also had large leg spurs that where similar in size to the other males (Figure 1C. The transgenic aromatase males were housed separately until sexual maturity, at which point they were moved to pens together with one male control from the same hatch group. Although they resembled females in appearance, the Tg males also crowed and the control males did not show any interest in them. No attempt to milk semen from these birds was made due to their apparent female phenotype. For both hatch groups, the control males and females showed sexually dimorphic weights at all time points analyzed (Figure 1D. The Tg males were consistently heavier than control females and were indistinct from the average male weights of their respective hatch groups. The experiment was terminated when hatch group 528–12 was 39 weeks of age, and hatch group 582–19 was 33 weeks of age. Analysis of the reproductive systems revealed that the entire reproductive tracts of the Tg-Aromatase males were very similar to those of the control male and all expected structures were present (Figure 2A. Both transgenic birds had 2 large symmetrical gonads that were of similar size to normal male testes. However, these gonads were less ovoid in appearance and had reduced vascularization of the tunica compared with the control male.Tg-Aromatase birds maintain testicular development despite high estrogen levels. A, left panel, The reproductive organs of Tg-Aromatase and control chickens at 35 (39 for Tg-Arom-1) weeks of age. The gonads of transgenic birds mostly resembled those of the control male; however, they were less vascularized and were less uniform in shape. Right panel, qRT-PCR was used to measure levels of aromatase in cDNA from adult gonads. Relative expression is shown as fold change compared with control ovarian tissue, and levels for left and right gonads of Tg birds. B, The presence of aromatase in transgenic gonads was then confirmed using immunofluorescence (red) on the left gonads for each (magnification, ×20). Both Tg-Aromatase birds showed localized aromatase expression, particularly in cells surrounding the seminiferous cords. Immunostaining for fibronectin (red) was then used to highlight the structural features of control and transgenic left gonads (magnification, ×10). The seminiferous tubules of Tg-Aromatase males resembled those of the control male, all of which were in contrast to the ovarian follicles of the control female.The expression of aromatase in gonad tissues was then measured by qRT-PCR (Figure 2A. Compared with the control ovarian tissue, levels in the transgenic males were variable, ranging from 5-fold greater in left gonad of Tg-Arom-1, to approximately half in the left gonad of Tg-Arom-2 (Figure 2A. As expected, immunostaining for aromatase on control female tissues showed expression in the theca layer surrounding the ovarian follicles (Figure 2B. In the transgenic males, low levels of aromatase were detected in the cells within tubule-like structures, whereas some interstitial cells had very high levels. In the male control, fibronectin immunostaining delineated the basement membrane and hence outlined testis cords. Fibronectin in the transgenic males was evident outside structures that resembled seminiferous tubules and was generally consistent with the control male (Figure 2B. Estrogen receptor was not up-regulated in Tg males (data not shown).The integrity of these tubules was then further analyzed by histology. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that the Tg males had seminiferous tubules that resembled the control, which included spermatocytes and late stage spermatids (Figure 3). Immunostaining for key testis factors DMRT1 (Sertoli and germ cells) and SOX9 (Sertoli cells) showed that the pattern and cellular localization of these proteins for the transgenic males resembled that of the control male, with Sertoli cells arranged peripherally within the seminiferous tubules (Figure 3). These data therefore confirmed that the molecular composition of the gonads of the transgenic males was testicular. However, it was also clear that both Tg males had reduced numbers of these cells, suggesting that these birds were subfertile.Tg-Aromatase males have normal Sertoli cell development but have reduced spermatogenesis. Top panel, Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining on gonads of control and Tg-Aromatase males showed the presence of seminiferous tubules, which included spermatocytes (white arrowheads), with reduced numbers of late stage spermatids (black arrowheads). Lower panel, Testicular pathway signaling was analyzed by immunostaining for DMRT1 (red) and SOX9 (red) (magnification, ×20). It was found that the seminiferous tubules of the Tg-Aromatase males closely resembled those of the control male, because DMRT1 cells and SOX9-positive cells were arranged at the outside of cord structures.In the chicken embryo, estrogen plays a central role in embryonic gonadal sex differentiation. This has been proven experimentally by directly administering estrogen (3, 4) and by suppressing aromatase (1). These studies lead us to hypothesize that a constant supply of estrogen in adult male chickens could enforce a lasting ovarian phenotype. The current study addresses this idea through the constitutive expression of aromatase in genetically male transgenic chickens. Although this lead to high serum estradiol, these birds retained mostly male phenotypes, including normal male body weights, leg spurs, and testicular tissues. Some feminization was observed, evidenced by the size of the comb and wattle and the female-type feathering pattern. The latter is consistent with the henny feathering trait reported in Campine and Sebright chicken strains, in which a mutation induces ectopic expression of aromatase in the skin of both sexes, causing female-type feathering (14). These data therefore imply that high levels of circulating estrogens in male chickens are insufficient to support complete female development. This study supports a model whereby direct genetic factors and sex hormones have major and minor roles, respectively, in avian sexual differentiation. However, a larger sample size would test this model.Due to the low numbers of transgenic individuals produced, all analyses in the current study were completed on samples taken posthatching. It was therefore not possible to verify the overexpression of aromatase and its effect in embryonic gonads. For this reason, it is conceivable that differences in the activities of the Tol2/CMV-Aromatase cassette compared with the viral vector RCASBP (10) at critical stages of embryonic gonad differentiation might account for the lack of sex reversal reported here. However, the CMV IE sequence is a strong and ubiquitous promoter, which has been shown to confer widespread expression in chicken embryos (although gonad tissues were not directly analyzed) (15). Therefore, gonads might have been initially sex reversed but reverted back to a testis phenotype later in life due genetic influences of the male sex chromosomes. A similar scenario has been reported in triploid chickens (3A;ZZW) which have ovotestes at hatching but these revert to testes later (16). Indeed, rather than purely gonad-driven sex determination, sex identity in chickens appears at least partly cell autonomous (17). For example, in gynandromorph chickens, the chromosome complement of the individual cells of the gonad dominate over the influences of circulating hormones (17). It also clear, however, that at embryonic stages gonadal cells can respond to estrogen manipulation (1, 3, 4, 10). Considered together, it is likely that embryonic gonads are relatively plastic and can be modulated by estrogen but later on during life become unresponsive to at least some hormonal influences.Despite the development of testes in the 2 transgenic chickens, serum testosterone was absent. This is most likely due to the ubiquitous aromatase, converting testosterone into estrogens. Indeed, this would also help account for the high levels of estradiol measured. Furthermore, high estradiol would likely induce negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary system, resulting in impaired gonadotropin release and subsequent testosterone production. In any case, the disruption to spermatogenesis observed by histology (Figure 3) is likely to have occurred as a direct consequence of low testosterone. Withdrawal of this testosterone or knockout of the androgen receptor impairs spermatogenesis via several mechanisms, (18–21). The development of enlarged wattles and combs are considered to be testosterone-dependent morphological dimorphisms (22), and indeed these structures were greatly reduced in the Tg birds. However, these birds also developed spurs in the virtual absence of testosterone. Spur growth after ovariectomy has also been reported, suggesting that it is normally repressed by estrogen; however, spur growth also occurs in experimentally feminized cockerels (23), which have high estrogen. Although the current study does support the latter, considered together, this trait is likely to be initiated by genetic factors that are common to both sexes, but is also subject to hormonal regulation, the extent of which is likely to be breed-dependent.It must be emphasized that because only 2 individuals were analyzed in the current study, and because they had variable aromatase expression, these findings are preliminary and it is possible that by analyzing greater numbers of transgenic birds a greater variety of phenotypes might have been observed. Nonetheless, the current study supports the notion of major role for direct genetic effects upon avian sexual development in addition to hormonal signaling. Although preliminary, this work is the first to use transgenic technologies to modify sexual traits in poultry and therefore provides a platform for future studies using transgenic chickens.This work was partly conducted within the Poultry Cooperative Research Centre established and supported under the Australian Government's Cooperative Research Centres Program, and was supported by an National Health and Medical Research Council Program grant (A.H.S.).

To identify new candidate genes involved in ovary and testis development, RNA-seq was used to define the transcriptome of embryonic chicken gonads at the onset of sexual differentiation (day 6.0/stage 29).RNA-seq revealed more than 1000 genes that were transcribed in a sex-biased manner at this early stage of gonadal differentiation. Comparison with undifferentiated gonads revealed that sex biased expression was derived primarily from autosomal rather than sex-linked genes. Gene ontology and pathway analysis indicated that many of these genes encoded proteins involved in extracellular matrix function and cytoskeletal remodelling, as well as tubulogenesis. Several of these genes are novel candidate regulators of gonadal sex differentiation, based on sex-biased expression profiles that are altered following experimental sex reversal. We further characterised three female-biased (ovarian) genes; calpain-5 (CAPN5), G-protein coupled receptor 56 (GPR56), and FGFR3 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3). Protein expression of these candidates in the developing ovaries suggests that they play an important role in this tissue.This study provides insight into the earliest steps of vertebrate gonad sex differentiation, and identifies novel candidate genes for ovarian and testicular development.Gonadal sex differentiation in vertebrate embryos involves sexually dimorphic gene expression, leading to ovarian or testicular development. While a number of key gonadal differentiation genes have been identified and validated in a variety of organisms, large gaps in our understanding still exist [1, 2]. This likely underlies the significant number of human Disorders of Sex Development (DSD’s) that remain unexplained at the genetic level [1]. Identification of novel regulators of embryonic ovarian and testis differentiation is therefore required, and will greatly improve our understanding of normal and aberrant gonad sexual differentiation. The chicken embryo provides a unique model system for studying gonad development because development occurs in ovo (in the egg), allowing gonadal development to be directly manipulated [3]. In chickens and other birds, as in mammals, sex is determined by sex chromosome inheritance. However, birds have a ZZ male: ZW female sex chromosome system, which is the opposite of the XY male: XX female system found in mammals. Genes located on the sex chromosomes drive differentiation of the “bipotential” gonads into ovaries (in ZW females) or testes (in ZZ males). Several key genes involved in mammalian gonadal sex differentiation are conserved in chicken, including male up-regulated DMRT1, SOX9 and AMH, and female up-regulated Aromatase, FOXL2 and WNT4/RSPO1 [2–12]. However, the Y-chromosome linked SRY gene, which initiates testis development in mammals, is absent in birds. The best candidate master sex switch in birds is DMRT1, which is present on the Z sex chromosome and is expressed more highly in male gonads compared to females prior to and during sexual differentiation. Knockdown and over-expression of DMRT1 causes feminisation and masculinisation of the gonads respectively [3, 7]. Although a W-linked female (ovarian) determinant may yet exist, our extensive analysis has so far not produced a convincing candidate gene [13, 14].In chicken embryos, the gonads form on the medioventral surface of the mesonephric kidneys at embryonic day 3 (E3 - Hamburger and Hamilton stage 18) [15]. At this stage, they are undifferentiated or “bipotential”. At E6 (HH29), gonads begin morphological differentiation into testes in ZZ embryos or unilateral ovary in ZW embryos. Sex-specific gonadal morphology emerges at this time, and a small number of genes showing sexually dimorphic expression have been identified, notably the ovarian determinants FOXL2 and aromatase in females [11, 16, 17], and DMRT1, HEMOGEN and SOX9 in males [1, 4, 8, 10, 18–21]. However, in chicken, the exact functional relationships among these genes are unclear. Furthermore, human DSD’s imply the existence of other as yet unidentified gonad-determining genes in vertebrates generally.Previous screens in the mouse embryo have employed various methods to isolate novel genes regulating gonadal sex differentiation, such as high throughput whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) [22], differential display [23, 24], cDNA subtractive hybridization [25–28] cDNA microarrays [19, 29, 30] and RNA-seq on sorted germ cells [31]. However, technical limitations often mean that these approaches assay only a small fraction of the transcriptome, and some studies have sampled stages when the gonads are larger but when differentiation has already occurred. Nevertheless, several of these large-scale studies have successfully identified hundreds of genes with sexually dimorphic expression in embryonic mouse gonads. A microarray study on sorted gonadal somatic cells (using the Sf1-GFP reporter) from 10.5 and 11.5dpc found numerous sex-biased genes specific to the early differentiating Sertoli and granulosa cells [32]. Another study used microarrays on gonadal somatic cells to identify 2306 genes expressed in a sex-specific manner prior to, during and after gonadal sex differentiation (E10.5 – E13.5) [33]. An independent microarray screen compared sorted supporting cells (Sry or Sox9 – eGFP), interstitial or stromal cells (Mafb-eGFP) and germ cells (Oct4-eGFP) from XY and XX mouse gonads at E11.5, E12.5 and E13.5 [34]. These studies as well as the others mentioned above identified novel candidates such as Aard, Cst9, Mmd2, Cbln4, some of which have been further characterised in gonad development [24, 35–38]. Whilst these studies represent extensive transcriptome profiling of embryonic gonads, deep RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is considerably more sensitive [39]. In addition, RNA-seq reveals expression for all mRNAs, not only genes covered by microarray, allowing an unbiased analysis.In the current study, RNA-seq is used to assess sex-biased gene expression at the onset gonadal sex differentiation in embryonic chicken gonads. Our rationale is based on the assumption that genes important for ovary versus testis development will show sex-biased expression. We previously performed RNA sequencing on E4.5 gonads, at the bi-potential stage prior to sexual differentiation [14]. By comparing gene expression from this early stage to E6 (the onset of morphological differentiation), we find novel genes and pathways that are activated sex-specifically at the time of sexual differentiation; more than 1000 genes are transcribed in a sex-biased manner at this stage, and the majority of these become biased between E4.5 and E6. This is primarily due to an increased expression of autosomal, rather than sex-linked, genes between these time points. Gene ontology and pathway analysis indicate that these genes are involved in extracellular signalling as well as driving morphological changes such as ECM, cytoskeletal remodelling and tubulogenesis. We also find significant enrichment of genes reported in the embryonic mouse gonadal screens in the genes identified in our chicken screen, highlighting conservation of molecular mechanisms underlying gonad differentiation. Several novel candidate gonadal sex differentiation genes are identified and validated in vivo. Three female-biased (ovarian) genes are further characterised; calpain-5 (CAPN5), G-protein coupled receptor 56 (GPR56), and FGFR3 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3). These genes may play an important role during ovarian development. This study provides insight into the earliest steps of gonad sex differentiation, and identifies novel candidate genes for ovarian and testis development.To assess gene expression in the early differentiating testes and ovaries, paired gonads from E6 (HH29) were dissected and mRNA isolated as previously described [14]. For each sex, 2 pools of 18 gonad pairs (from 18 individuals) were collected. Messenger RNA was then processed and sequenced (Methods), resulting in an average of 46 000 000 read pairs per sample. We have previously performed the same analysis on E4.5 paired gonads [14]. Expression for each gene and differential expression (DE) analysis were then calculated (Methods). Gene expression is calculated in Fragments Per Kilobase of Exon Per Million Fragments Mapped (FPKM). Significance is calculated using False Discovery Rate (FDR) (see Methods).RNA-seq analysis detected expression of 17108 genes. As the gonads begin to differentiate at E6, a total of 1003 genes showed significant DE between the sexes (FDR <0.001). Of these, 347 were female-biased and 656 were male-biased (Fig. 1a). In contrast, at the earlier time point of E4.5, when the gonads are morphologically undifferentiated, only 267 genes were significantly DE (193 male biased genes and 74 female biased genes; FDR <0.001) (Fig. 1a, b). Thus, between E4.5 and E6 as the gonads begin to differentiate, a four-fold increase in sexually dimorphic transcript number was observed (from 1.56 to 5.86 % of all expressed genes). Substantial overlap was observed between the genes that were sexually DE at E4.5 and those at E6; 165 genes in males and 62 in females (85.5 and 83.8 % of the E4.5 DE genes were also DE at E6.5 in males and females respectively) (Fig. 1a). Indeed, of the 267 DE genes at E4.5, only 40 (15 %) lost this bias at E6 (Fig. 1a) and the majority of these (all but 5) reside on the sex chromosomes [W, Z or suspected W chromosome (un-random)] [14]. This may reflect changes in dosage compensation of these sex chromosome genes or changes in the expression of W linked genes [14, 40–42].Sexually dimorphic gene expression in the bi-potential and differentiating chicken embryonic gonads. a Venn diagrams indicating the number of significantly DE (FDR <0.001) genes for each time-point (undifferentiated gonads E4.5, differentiating gonads E6). This is divided into male-biased (blue) and female-biased (red). 193 genes were male biased at E4.5, and 656 at E6. Of these, 165 genes were DE at both time points, with only 28 genes being DE at only E4.5. 74 genes were DE in a female biased manner at E4.5, and 347 at E6. 62 of these were DE at both time points. b A heatmap of the top 400 DE genes for each sample (2 females and 2 males for each time point). The colour scale indicates the proportion of counts in each sample with respect to the sum across samples, after normalising for library size. With red indicating the highest expression relative to other samples and dark blue being the least. On the left is hierarchical clustering of these genes. The known W-linked genes are indicated by pink lines while the Z-linked genes are indicated by blue lines. c The number of DE genes (both male and female biased) found on the autosomes (green bars) versus the sex chromosomes (grey bars), for each time pointHierarchical clustering was performed on the 400 most significantly DE genes (those with the lowest P-values) from E4.5 and E6 gonads. The clustering of genes on the basis of expression level is represented in a heat map (Fig. 1b). W-linked genes clustered together and showed high differential expression in both female samples at both time-points (Fig. 1b), consistent with our previous observations [14]. Similarly, Z-linked genes clustered together. Importantly, autosomal genes that were DE were primarily present in E6 and not E4.5 gonads, with female DE genes clustering together for each sample and male DE genes clustering. The overall number of DE sex-linked genes did not greatly change between the time-points (E4.5 = 224, E6 = 304). This indicates that the increase in biased genes expression between E4.5 and E6 was largely due to transcriptional changes in autosomal genes, which increased from 43 DE genes at E4.5 (16 %) to 699 (70 %) at E6 (Fig. 1c). Taken together, these data show that between E4.5 and E6, there was a significant increase in the number of autosomal genes showing sexually dimorphic expression. These genes are novel candidates for contributing to gonad sexual differentiation.The expression profiles of known or putative regulators of gonadal sexual differentiation were assessed at E4.5 and E6 (Table 1). Of the known sexual regulators based on previous studies in chicken or mammals, only one autosomal gene was significantly DE at E4.5 in females; FOXL2 (FDR <0.001). At E6, FOXL2 continued to be differentially expressed, and in addition CYP19A1/Aromatase, HSD17B1 and NROB1 (DAX-1) transcripts became female enriched (Table 1). Four genes showed significantly male-biased expression at both time-points; HSD17B4, DMRT1, HEMOGEN, and AMH (FDR <0.001). Inhibin A and B trended towards sexual dimorphism (FDR 0.0027, 0.0012 respectively) at E4.5, and by E6 both were significantly male-enriched (Table 1). SOX9 showed male-biased expression at E6 only, confirming previous studies suggesting that it lies downstream of Z-linked genes DMRT1 and HEMOGEN [3, 20]. These data imply that major components of the sex determination pathways are activated between E4.5 and E6 (developmental stages HH 25/26 to HH 29/30). Several other sex-development genes show gonadal expression but no sexual dimorphism (Table 1). Indeed, many known regulators of bipotential gonad formation such as LHX9, EMX2, GATA4 and FOG2 were very highly expressed in both female and male E4.5 gonads, while expression decreased significantly in E6 gonads (Table 1). This confirms that the E4.5 gonads are still undifferentiated, whereas at E6 the differentiation process has commenced, reflected by down-regulation of genes required for the formation of the undifferentiated gonad and up-regulation of sex-differentiation genes.While no RNA-seq analysis has yet been reported for whole embryonic mouse gonads, large-scale transcriptional screens have been carried out [22]. To assess conservation of sexually dimorphic genes in other organisms, chicken DE genes at E6 (P-value <0.05) were compared with those from three separate large-scale mouse microarray screens [32, 33, 43]. The first of these studies assayed somatic cells from XX and XY embryonic mouse gonads at E10.5, E11.5, E12.5 and E13.5, with E11.5 – 12.5 being equivalent to chicken E6 (stage 29/30) [33]. The second study used isolated somatic cells from XX and XY gonads at 10.5 and 11.5dpc and identified genes showing male up-regulation or down-regulation specific to 11.5dpc, as well as female up-regulation at 11.5dpc [32]. In the third study, isolated supporting cells, stromal/interstitials cells and germ cells were profiled from XX and XY mice [34]. All three of these studies used different methods of assessing differential expression, but all used a P-value of 0.05 to assess DE genes at each time point. To compare our data to these studies, we used a P-value of 0.05 to find E6 DE genes in the chicken. This results in a list of 2123 genes. This gene list was then compared with those identified as sex-biased at 11.5 and 12.5dpc from Nef et al. [33] and Jameson et al. [34], and with those identified in the other study [32]. Fisher’s exact tests were also carried out to test for statistically significant enrichment of each data set in our set. When we compared each data set to our DE gene list we found significant enrichment (P-value <0.001) for each study (Table 2). Our RNA-seq study was carried out on whole gonads, and will hence encompass expression from various populations of cells include supporting cells and germ cells. By comparing to each cell lineage from the Jameson et al. study, we could also see that DE genes associated with supporting cell (443), and interstitial cells (210) are represented in our data set at a significant level (Table 2 P-value <0.001). Germ cells were enriched with a P-value of 0.00123 (163 genes). Overall, we found 76 genes in common between the three mouse studies alones (specifically in the supporting cell populations) (Table 2). Of these, 20 genes were also DE in our study (Table 2). Thus significant overlap between differentiating mouse and chickens gonads was observed, suggesting that similar genetic pathways are engaged between mammals and avians, validating the use of chicken embryonic gonads to screen for novel sex determination candidates.20 genes were common between all studies of somatic cells and our study (Table 2). These genes were Col14a1, Cyp11a1, Ogt, Slc20a1, Lect1, Nedd9, Prss12, Fst, Hpse, Gpm6b, Tesc, Atp1a1, Dapk1, Adm, Scarb2, Mef2c, Tyro3, Gdnf, Bace2 and Nac1. Some of these genes have been implicated in sex development previously. CYP11A1 mutations cause congenital adrenal insufficiency and with partial or complete 46,XY sex reversal in humans. GDNF or glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor exerts a proliferative effect on developing mouse Sertoli cells [44]. Finally, Tescalin (Tesc) has been previously described as an early testis gene [45, 46], although no gonadal phenotypes have been described in a null mutant mouse [47]. We also analysed the overlap between these studies and our dataset using a P-value cut off of 0.001 to determine DE genes. This dataset has 1003 genes, half of what we have using the less stringent P-value of 0.05. Consistently, we found reduced numbers of overlapping genes, but enrichment was still significant between all groups (Additional file 1: Table S3).To elucidate novel pathways engaged during sexual differentiation of ovaries and testes, pathway analysis was performed on the dataset. To this end, genes were filtered that were only sexually dimorphic at E6 (FDR <0.001), but not in the undifferentiated gonads (E4.5). Genes previously implicated in sex determination or differentiation were removed, to reveal novel activated pathways. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was carried out on this list of 774 genes (Additional file 2: Table S1) using DAVID [48, 49]. We assessed three ontological categories: Biological process (BP), Cellular component (CC) and Molecular function (MF) (Table 3). The top 3 BP categories in DE genes were tube development, cell proliferation and respiratory tube development. The CCs most represented were extracellular and cell surface. The MFs were lipid binding, growth factor activity and ATPase activity (Table 3).To assess the probable functions of the genes in this data set, we used DAVID functional analysis of KEGG pathways [48]. The top five KEGG pathways that were significantly engaged (based on calculated P-value <0.05) were focal adhesion, dorsal-ventral axis formation, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, ECM-receptor interaction, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (Table 3). Numerous DE genes were implicated in each of these pathways (i.e. Additional file 3: Figure S1A, B). The high number of genes involved in extracellular function and in the engagement of pathways involved in actin cytoskeletal remodelling and ECM function is consistent with the significant morphological changes that are taking place as the gonads differentiate into ovaries or testis. Indeed, the embryonic ovary and testis differ significantly in their morphology; the ovary develops a thickened cortex to house germ cells, while the medulla becomes fragmented, and the testis organizes into basement membrane bound seminiferous cords that enclose germ cells and supporting Sertoli cells. These morphological events begin at E6. Vasculature and seminiferous cord development are important in the testis [43], which was reflected here in the number of genes implicated in tube formation and development. Panther pathway analysis also revealed that the TGF-β pathway was significantly represented (P-value = 0.05), including BMP2, 3, 4 and 7 and BMPR2 as well as JUN and Myostatin. Indeed, BMP signalling has been implicated in ovarian and follicle development [50–53], although the exact role of these BMPs at this early stage needs to be elucidated.Known sex determination genes were effectively identified from the RNA-seq data set, many of which had sexually dimorphic expression only at E6. Based on this analysis, the sequencing data was interrogated to identify novel genes involved in chicken gonadal sex differentiation. For potential testis-determining genes, the data was filtered for genes showing sexually dimorphic expression at E6 (FDR < 0.001) which were male biased (Log2 fold change/Fem:male ratio of less than 1) and with a male gonadal expression of more than 10 FPKM. FPKM of 10 was chosen as a cut-off based on the expression of known gonad genes and on previous studies in our lab that suggest in vivo methods such as WISH do not detect the expression of genes with less than this value (data not shown). These testis genes were ranked according to P-value and the top 45 genes were tabulated (Additional file 4: Table S2). This list includes previously mentioned known sex-regulators such as DMRT1, HEMOGEN, AMH and SOX9. From this list, four candidate genes were chosen for further study, based on gene ontology and expression. Specifically we chose genes with a variety of expression levels/fold changes, and which are thought to be involved in transcriptional regulation or morphogenesis/cell differentiation. These were laminin1 (LAMA1), BMP receptor 2 (BMPR2), zinc-finger 385B (ZNF385b) and a novel, uncharacterised gene on the Z chromosome that we designated NZP (Table 4). To identify genes involved in ovarian development, genes were filtered for significant sexual dimorphism at E6 (FDR <0.001), female bias (Log2 fold change > than 1) and with a female expression greater than FPKM 10. All W-linked genes were removed as these have been analyzed previously [14], and the remaining genes were ranked according to P-value (Additional file 4: Table S2), and the top 45 taken. From this list, three novel candidate genes for ovarian development were chosen based on their expression profiles and on their gene ontology. These were calpain-5 (CAPN5), G-protein coupled receptor 56 (GPR56) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) (Table 4).Whole-mount in situ hybridisation (WISH) of chicken embryonic urogenital systems (UGS) at E6 was used to confirm mRNA expression of the seven candidate genes (Figs. 2 and 3). By this method, genes could be assessed for their degree of gonad specificity, and their expression could be localised to a gonadal cell type. WISH confirmed male-biased expression in the E6 gonads for all four of the testis candidate genes; LAMA1, BMPR2, ZNF385B, and NZP (Fig. 2a-d versus i-l). Over-staining and sectioning showed that all four of these genes were expressed in the seminiferous cords of the developing testis (Fig. 2e-h). BMPR2, ZNF385b and NZP had only low level, diffuse expression in the ovary (Fig. 2i-o), while LAMA1 had expression in the juxta-cortical medulla of the ovary (Fig. 2l, p). None of these genes were notably expressed at other sites within the urogenital system.Male candidate gene expression in vivo. Whole mount in situ hybridisation for 4 male-biased candidate genes, on E6 UGS (UGS) from males and females. BMPR2 is more highly expressed in males (a, e) than in females (i, m). In over-stained sections, BMPR2 appears to be expressed in the testis cords (e). ZNF385b shows greater expression in males (b, f) than females (j, n), consistent with RNA-seq. In males it is expressed in the cords (f). NZP, a novel Z-protein, is expressed in males more highly than females (c, g versus k, o). It is also expressed in the cords of males (g). LAMA1 is also higher in males (d) than females (l) and is expressed in testis cords in males (h), with some weak expression in the juxta-cortical medulla in females (p). These results are consistent with RNA-seq data. Typically, 3 UGS from each sex were used for each probe, and these images are representative. A sense control probe did not show any staining for any of the candidate genes (data not shown)Female candidate genes expression in vivo. Whole mount in situ hybridisation for 3 female-biased candidate genes, on E6 UGS from males and females. CAPN5 is more highly expressed in female (a) than in males, where only low staining is observed (g, j). CAPN5 is also expressed in the adrenal glands in both females and males (a, g arrows). In over-stained sections CAPN5 appears to be expressed in the juxta-cortical medulla of the ovary (d). GPR56 shows strong expression in female gonads (b) and no expression in the males (h, k), consistent with RNA-seq. In females it is expressed in the cortex of the ovary, with a lower level in the medulla (e). FGFR3 is also higher in females (c) than males, which show low expression (i – gonads delineated by lines). FGFR3 is mostly expressed in the ovarian cortex (f), and in the male weakly in a subset of cord cells (l, arrow heads). These results are consistent with RNA-seq data. Typically, 3 UGS from each sex were used for each probe, and these images are representative of what is seen. A sense control probe is also tested, and did not show any staining for any of the genes (data not shown)All three candidate ovarian genes showed strong female-biased expression at E6.0 (stage 29/30) (Fig. 3a-c versus g-i) in WISH. CAPN5 and GPR56 were strongly expressed in female gonads but only weakly expressed in males (Fig. 3a, b and g, h). GPR56 and FGFR3 had no expression in other sites within the urogenital system, while CAPN5 showed expression in the adrenal glands of both males and females (Fig. 3a, g arrows). Sectioning revealed that CAPN5 was expressed in a subset of medullary cells close to the cortex – the juxta-cortical medulla (Fig. 3d). GPR56 and FGFR3 were expressed primarily in the cortex of the ovary (Fig. 3e, f). Taken together these results indicate that the gonad RNA-seq data was robustly validated by in situ hybridisation.RNA-seq and WISH analysis revealed the expression of three female- and four male-biased gonadal genes. To test the involvement of these genes in the gonadal differentiation pathways, experimental sex reversal was carried out using the aromatase inhibitor, fadrozole. Fadrozole inhibits the activity of the aromatase enzyme, blocking oestrogen production, and resulting in female to male sex reversal of the embryonic gonads [54, 55]. Fadrozole was injected into fertile eggs at E3 (stage 19) and gonads were harvested from embryos at E9 (stage 33). WISH was used to compare gene expression to that of stage-matched controls.The male-biased genes, BMPR2 and ZNF385b (Fig. 4a-c and d-f) were up-regulated in sex-reversed females (Fig. 4c, f) compared to control females (Fig. 4b, e), suggesting that the expression of these is a consequence of male sex differentiation. While NZP also showed up-regulation in the treated female (Fig. 4i), expression of this gene is low at this time-point in both sexes (Fig. 4g, h). Similarly, LAMA1 expression was weaker in the male at this time point, and only a weak activation was observed in the female treated with fadrozole (Fig. 4j-l). Further functional analysis of these three candidate testis genes is currently underway. Antibodies have been raised against ZNF385b and knockdown is being conducted using our established virally delivered RNAi approach [7]. The female-biased genes CAPN5 (Fig. 4m-o), GPR56 (Fig. 4p-r) and FGFR3 (Fig. 4s-u) all showed down-regulation in fadrozole treated female gonads (Fig. 4o, r, u) compared to the untreated female. In GPR56, only the left gonad of females showed robust expression at this point (Fig. 4q). This was lost in fadrozole treated gonads (Fig. 4r). These data show that these genes are expressed in female-specific cell types as a consequence of the early steps of ovarian differentiation. Their expression is subsequently lost when ovaries are sex reversed. These data indicate that the RNA-seq screen was used to successfully identify candidate genes for ovarian or testis development. As our interest lies in identifying novel genes involved in ovary differentiation, we further focused on CAPN5, GPR56 and FGFR3.Expression of candidate genes is altered in sex-reversed gonads. Whole mount in situ of E9 UGS from male controls, female controls or fadrozole treated females. The expression of male candidate genes BMPR2 (a-c) and ZNF385b (d-f) changed dramatically in fadrozole treated embryos (c, f), where expression was almost at the same level as untreated males (a, d). NZP also had increased expression in treated females (i) compared to untreated (h), although expression of this gene has generally dropped in control males at this stage (g). LAMA1 expression had also dropped in males at E9 (j), and only low expression was found in females (k). A slight increase in expression was seen in treated females (l). CAPN5 was lost from the gonads (dotted lines) but not the adrenal gland of treated females (o) compared to control females (n) . In the gonads it obtained a similar level of expression to control males (m). GPR56, which is absent in males (p), was also lost from treated females (r) whereas in untreated females it is strongly expressed in the left ovary (q). Similarly, fadrozole treatment abolished FGFR3 staining in the gonads (u), to a similar level as untreated males (s) from normal strong expression in females (t)Only a small number of genes have so far been shown to play a deterministic role in ovarian differentiation and development [1]. Screens such as the one described here provide additional candidate genes, which will fill gaps in our understanding of ovarian morphogenesis. Therefore we focused on the female-biased candidates FGFR3, CAPN5 and GPR56. FGFR3 is a receptor for fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) which have been shown to play a central role in gonad differentiation and germ cell development [56–58]. A role for FGFR3 has not been described in the ovary during embryogenesis. Calpain-5 (CAPN5) encodes an intracellular calcium-dependent cysteine protease, and has similarity to the Caenorhabditis elegans sex determination gene tra-3. CAPN5 has not been implicated in gonad development in vertebrates. GPR56 is an adhesion-associated G-protein coupled receptor that mediates intracellular signal transduction. GPR56 null mice have impaired testis formation and infertility [59]. No phenotype has been reported in female mice.To study these proteins, a commercial antibody was used for FGFR3 and in-house antibodies were raised against CAPN5 and GPR56 proteins. These new antibodies were tested for specificity (Additional file 5: Figure S2). To this end, open reading frames of chicken CAPN5 and GPR56 were cloned and expressed them in a chicken fibroblastic cell line (Additional file 5: Figure S2). Two polyclonal antibodies were tested for each protein, at various concentrations (data not shown). For GPR56, while low background staining was observed in untransfected DF1 cells (Additional file 5: Figure S2A), strong expression was observed when transfection with the GPR56 plasmid was carried out (Additional file 5: Figure S2B). This staining appeared to be cytoplasmic, excluded from the nucleus (Additional file 5: Figure S2Bi, Bii). CAPN5 specific staining is observed only in the transfected cells and not in the control cells (Additional file 5: Figure S2C, D), and it appears punctate throughout the cytoplasm (Di, Dii). These antibodies were then used to assay expression in embryonic gonads. CAPN5 was detected in female gonads at E6 in a subset of cells in the medulla. By E8.5 (HH stage 32) this expression had increased and was evident in a subset of juxta-cortical medullary cells (Fig. 5b). CAPN5 appeared to be cytoplasmic in these cells (Fig. 5c). This protein expression pattern was consistent with the mRNA expression pattern. Some low level punctate staining was observed in the males from E8.5 (Fig. 5a). GPR56 was also expressed from E6.5 (HH 30) in the female, with only background staining in the male. Expression of GPR56 was highest in the cortex of the ovary where it appeared to be cytoplasmic and at the plasma membrane (Fig. 5e, f). (See also Additional file 5: Figure S2E, F for additional images.) The FGFR3 antibody detected protein in the germ cells in both sexes (Fig. 5g, h), where it is cytoplasmic or at the plasma membrane (Fig. 5Gi). Staining was stronger in the ovary (Fig. 5h), especially in the cortex (Fig. 5i), which may reflect its expression in somatic cortical cells as well as germ cells.Novel candidate female genes are translated in the embryonic gonads. Immunofluorescence staining using antibodies raised in house (CAPN5 and GPR56) or commercial antibodies (FGFR3) in E8 gonads. CAPN5 protein is only weakly expressed in males (a), but shows high expression in a subset of cells in the female gonads (b). These cells are present in the juxta-cortical medulla, and staining appears cytoplasmic (c). GPR56 is expressed in the cortex of the female (e, f), where it appears cytoplasmic, although this staining is weak, and GPR56 is weak in male gonads (d). FGFR3 is expressed in the male gonads (g) and in the female gonads (h), where it is strongly expressed in the membrane or cytosol of the germ cells (see insert Gi). Strong staining in the female cortex (i) is probably due to germ cell expression, although may also be due to additional cortical cells expressing this receptorThe female-biased expression of these proteins, especially CAPN5 and GPR56, indicates that they might play a role in ovarian development from the time of sexual differentiation, and further validates RNA-seq as a useful tool for the identification of novel candidate gonad differentiation genes. Further studies including functional analysis are currently underway in our laboratory to assess the precise role of these genes.Sexual differentiation of the gonads during embryonic development involves the sex-biased expression and action of several well-characterised regulators of ovarian or testicular development. However, only a small number of genes have been identified and many cases of unexplained human DSDs point to the existence of uncharacterised genetic regulators of embryonic gonadal development. RNA-seq was employed here to identify novel candidate sex genes, using embryonic chicken gonads as a model system. This study is the first to report RNA-seq in entire gonads at the time of sexual differentiation in a vertebrate species. We have combined previous analysis of female and male gonads at E4.5, prior to sexual differentiation, with new data from E6 gonads. By comparing these two time-points, a detailed view of the gonad transcriptome during sexual differentiation has been revealed.While the expression of several known or putative gonad sex determinants has previously been assessed in embryonic chicken gonads [10, 16, 19, 60–63], this has often been based on assessment of suspected genes and pathways, employing whole mount in situ, qRT-PCR, or protein expression. These screens have been successful in identifying candidates, some of which are also found here (e.g., CLDN11, INHA, InhibinA and B and BMPR2). [64]. In addition, some of these studies have identified transcriptional differences between the left and right ovary, the latter of which regresses in chicken [64, 65]. We did not separate left and right ovary in this study. Nevertheless, these approaches are biased towards known pathways inferred from other vertebrates. They lack both the sensitivity and detail of RNA-seq. Indeed, RNA-seq can reveal early changes in gene expression undetectable by other methods.Firstly, the RNA-seq data has provided information on the expression of known or putative sex genes. These results are interesting when considering the inferred molecular hierarchy of genes and their signalling in the gonads, both in chicken and other species. For example, in females FOXL2 shows sexual dimorphism from E4.5, preceding that of aromatase, which does not become significantly DE until E6. This is consistent with previous studies that have suggested that FOXL2 acts upstream of other female genes, at least at the transcriptional level [11, 16, 66]. Indeed, in other species ranging from fishes to mammals, FOXL2 is a putative or known activator of aromatase gene expression [67, 68]. Given that Aromatase expression and oestrogen synthesis is essential for ovary formation in birds, FOXL2 likely occupies a key position in the female pathway. In addition, a recent study has suggested that the main role of FOXL2 is as a repressor of male genes [69], and this may explain the importance of early FOXL2 expression where it would drive the gonadal primordium towards an ovarian fate by repressing male genes and activating female genes.In the avian embryo, and indeed other vertebrates, the activator of FOXL2 has not been clearly defined, and while a W-chromosome linked gene may fulfil this role in the chicken, no convincing candidate exists. Alternatively, FOXL2 may be activated by a factor common to both sexes that is antagonized by elevated expression of Z-linked DMRT1. DMRT1 can antagonise FOXL2 expression, as evidenced in DMRT1 knockdown gonads, which exhibit elevated FOXL2 transcription and feminization [7]. Both Z-linked DMRT1 and HEMOGEN show significant male-bias at E4.5, as does AMH, preceding SOX9, which becomes male up-regulated at E6. This indicates that DMRT1/Hemogen activate SOX9 transcription, which is supported by recent over-expression studies in ovo [3, 10, 20].As the gonads enter the phase of sexual differentiation, they up-regulate sexually dimorphic gene expression, most of which is autosomal. Given that some known sex determining genes are dimorphic prior to this activation (e.g., DMRT1 and FOXL2), these activated genes at E6 (stage 29/30) are likely downstream regulators of ovarian versus testis development. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis suggests that many of these genes are involved in the restructuring of the gonad into the morphologically distinct testis or ovary. There was an over-representation of genes involved in ECM and cytoskeleton formation and regulation in the datasets. Indeed, a study that used network approaches to analyse sex-biased gene expression in chickens suggested that genes of the same sex bias tended to be more connected to each other than expected, and that when genes were grouped into sex-biased modules these showed functional homogeneity [70].Our RNA-seq was carried out on whole chicken gonads and therefore encompasses expression from both supporting cell types (presumptive granulosa and Sertoli) as well as from interstitial cells and from germ cells. To assess the relative importance of each cell type and the potential overlap with mouse gonadal expression profiles we compared our screen and three high throughput microarray screens carried out on embryonic mouse gonads/cells at a similar stage of differentiation [32–34]. We found significant enrichment (P-value <0.001) between the genes identified in each study and our own. In addition, these analyses indicate that we have found DE genes from not just supporting cell types, but also from the germ cell and stromal/interstitial cell pools, albeit to a lesser extent. Interestingly, we found only 76 genes were common between the three mouse studies (specifically in the supporting cells only). This probably reflects the subtle differences between each of these screens such as the transgenic mice used, the sorting methods, the microarray platforms and the analyses. Interestingly though, of these 76 genes 20 were also DE in our data set. The presence of several already characterised gonadal genes in this list means that these represent excellent candidates for further investigation.The RNA-seq analysis also provided novel candidate genes for sexual differentiation in female and male chicken embryos. By comparing expression in females and males at E6 numerous significantly sexually dimorphic genes not previously implicated in gonad development were identified. To validate these lists, several male and female biased genes of interest were chosen, based on their gene ontology and expression. These were validated in vivo using WISH to assess their expression in the UGS and in sex reversed gonads. For all genes assayed, expression profiles in WISH mimicked those in the RNA-seq data, which we have also found previously with W genes [14]. For male-biased genes, expression was present in the testis cords, and was up-regulated when female gonads were experimentally sex-reversed using the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole. The female genes assayed were either present in the medulla (CAPN5) or the cortex (FGFR3 and GPR56) of the developing ovary. In the presence of fadrozole, these female-biased genes had reduced expression, which was similar to the level observed in ZZ males. These results suggest that RNA-seq has successfully identified candidate genes for gonadal sexual differentiation in the avian system.Only a small number of genes implicated in ovarian development have been described. Many of these have derived from analysis of human or animal disorders of sex development, i.e. WNT4 [71], R-spondin1 [72, 73], FOXL2 [74] reviewed in [1]. There are still gaps in our understanding of both the initial triggers and the downstream modulators of ovarian development. This study has identified numerous female-biased genes, which may play a role in ovarian differentiation. Indeed, we focused our studies on three of these genes, using specific antibodies against the chicken proteins. Protein expression was similar to that revealed by the RNA-seq and WISH analyses. Closer investigation into expression provided insight into the potential role of these genes.One candidate gene was FGFR3, an FGF receptor. FGF9 plays a key role in testis differentiation, and in the regulation of germ cell development [56–58]. Several FGF receptors exist in vertebrate species. Loss of FGFR2 in mice testis leads to partial sex reversal [75], but intriguingly both FGFR2 and FGFR3 show significant female-biased expression in our E6 data. FGFR3 has been shown to interact with FGF1 and FGF9 [76] and is thought to be important in the post-natal testis [77]. A role for FGFR3 has not yet been described in the ovary during embryogenesis. Interestingly, FGF9 itself was very weakly expressed in E6 gonads, and was not sex-biased, and so the role of this FGF may not be conserved outside mammals. (Although a role could be played by a related FGF). Furthermore, we did not identify any FGF ligand showing male-biased expression at E6. In contrast, FGF16 showed robust female-biased expression. This FGF is also female-biased in Nile tilapia gonads [78], and may play a role in early oocyte development. It is interesting to speculate that FGF16 signalling though FGFR2/3 in the female may contribute to ovary differentiation or female germ cell maturation in chickens.CAPN5 was expressed in the adrenal glands of both sexes, and the gonads of the female only, where it was found in a subset of cells present in the juxta-cortical medulla. The 3βHSD enzyme, which is involved in the synthesis of sex steroids testosterone and oestrogen is also expressed in a similar subset of cells as well as the adrenal glands (Lambeth et al. Submitted). This indicates that different cell lineages exist in the medulla and it appears that CAPN5 is expressed in a subset of these. These data suggest that this novel candidate may be involved in the differentiation or function of steroid producing cells in the ovary as well as in the adrenal glands of both sexes.In contrast, our third ovarian candidate, GPR56, was expressed in cortex of the differentiating ovary as it proliferates during ovarian development. WNT4 and RSPO1 are expressed in the cortex of the developing ovary, and their activated transcription factor β-catenin appears to be stabilized there [5]. Recently, another G-protein coupled receptor, Lgr5 has been shown to be expressed in cortical granulosa precursor cells, and plays a role in germ cell differentiation and survival [79]. Indeed, LGR5 binds R-spondin proteins and enhances RSPO/WNT/β-catenin signalling [80–83]. It will be interesting to determine if GPR56 also interacts with this pathway in the cortex of the chicken ovary.These genes are all interesting candidates for ovarian development and functional studies including overexpression and knockdown are now underway in our laboratory to establish their exact roles. Most recently, we have developed the method of in ovo electroporation to deliver genes or antisense RNAs directly into developing gonads [3, 84]. This methodology is being used to manipulate the novel candidate genes identified in the current study.Several caveats to this type of analysis that focuses on sexually dimorphic genes is that not all key genes involved in ovarian versus testicular development will be expressed in a sex-biased fashion. Some genes may be expressed in both sexes but only have a key role on one sex. In mouse embryos, Gadd45g and Map3k4 are expressed in the early gonad equally in both sexes, yet mutations in these genes lead only to sex reversal in XY males [85–87] because they act on the SRY gene (present on the Y chromosome) through the p38 MAPK pathway. Typically these genes have been identified in human DSD cases or mouse mutants. In addition, this analysis was based on genes correctly annotated in the Galgal4 chicken genome, thus missing genes that are unannotated or lie in regions that have typically been difficult to sequence. De novo transcript assembly of the mRNAs expressed at E6 may reveal additional novel candidates for sex determination.This study represents the first RNA-seq analysis of embryonic gonads at the time of sexual differentiation. These data have provided a detailed view of the transcriptional changes that occur when sexual differentiation begins. Over 1000 genes were significantly sexually DE at this stage, most of which are autosomal genes. Many of these likely contribute to the morphological changes taking place, such as ECM remodelling and tubulogenesis. These data provide several new candidate ovary or testis differentiation genes, some of which we have validated in vivo. In particular, we show that CAPN5 and GPR56 are excellent candidates for ovarian development. Functional studies on these novel candidates are now underway in our laboratory, with a view to clarifying their roles in gonadal development and differentiation.All experimental work adhered to the Australian code of practice for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes (7th edition, 2004) and to in-house animal handling guidelines (Murdoch Childrens Research Institute and CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory). Ethics was from MCRI - Chicken Ethics: Institute Animal Ethics number A627. IBC (Institute Biosafety Committee): 103ext-2007, and 194–2013 EXEMPT. All experiments were carried out on a single line of Specific Pathogen Free embryos (SPAFAS) from the White Leghorn strain of chick (Lohman-LSL) and incubated at 37.8 °C with rocking in a humidified incubator. For RNA-seq, SPF eggs were incubated until stage 29 (embryonic day 6) or E4.5 see [14]. Paired gonads were removed and stored at −80 °C. Embryos were sexed by PCR as described previously [88], briefly, a small piece of limb tissue was digested in PCR compatible buffer containing proteinase K (200 μg/ml at 50 °C for at least 30 min), followed by rapid PCR amplification of the sex-linked, female-specific Xho1 sequence. Amplification of 18S ribosomal RNA genomic sequence was used as the internal control in a duplex reaction.Tissues were pooled according to sex. Eighteen paired gonads (i.e. left and right gonads from 18 individuals) were pooled for each replicate (two male replicates and two female replicates). Pooling has been documented as an appropriate way to prepare samples for expression analysis [89]. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy micro kit (QIAGEN). On column DNAsing was performed to remove contaminating genomic DNA. The resulting 4 RNA replicates were poly A-selected, reverse transcribed, fragmented, bar-coded and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq2000 at Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF) in Melbourne. We sequenced 100 base pair, paired ends reads.Differential expression (DE) analysis on the raw reads was carried out by testing the female read counts against male read counts using edgeR [90], using count data from E6 and earlier time-points from [14]. P-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method [91]. Sequenced read pairs (from both E6 and E4.5 time-points) were mapped to the chicken genome (galGal4) using the TopHat 2.0.6 software [92]. We used Ensembl version 73, which has 17108 genes. The Ensembl gene annotation was provided to TopHat to aid alignment, with other settings default. Read pairs were summarized to Ensembl gene-level counts using featureCounts [93]. Default edgeR settings were used including normalisation using TMM. Homology of the read-pairs with Ensembl genes was then calculated, and expression for each gene calculated in Fragments Per Kilobase Of Exon Per Million Fragments Mapped (FPKM).Genes were sorted based on their minimum P-value (irrespective of time-point) and the top 400 DE genes were hierarchical clustered. Clustering was performed on the proportion of counts in each sample with respect to the sum across samples, after normalising for library size. The clustering and heatmap were created using the hclust and heatmap.2 functions in R respectively (using default settings - agglomeration clustering using complete linkage). Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis were carried out using DAVID according to the default actions.Gene lists (converted to mouse universal gene symbol) were compiled for each significantly sexually dimorphic gene (generally P-value <0.05, FC of 1.5 or 2) described in each study using DAVID software (from either Ensembl ID, microarray ID or Unigene ID). Gene lists were then compared using R (version 3.2.0), and one-sided Fisher exact test was used to obtain a P-value for enrichment.Fertile eggs (SPF) were obtained from CSIRO, Werribee and incubated under humid conditions at 37.8 °C. Embryos were harvested at various days throughout development and staged according to the morphological criteria of Hamburger and Hamilton [15]. The UGS including the mesonephric kidneys, gonads and Müllerian duct were dissected out in PBS and fixed for either WISH or immunofluorescence.Plasmids containing fragments of mRNA for each gene were ordered from the BBSRC ChickEST Database. These were verified by PCR and sequencing. The clones were as follows; ZNF385b - ChEST470h3, BMPR2 - ChEST10191l3, NZP – ChEST203m10, Laminin - ChEST791a8 CAPN5 – ChEST992n12, FGFR3 – ChEST779m22. For the GPR56 and the ZNF385b the ORFs were also used to generate probes in pGEM T-easy. Probes were made using the either T7, Sp6 or T3 RNA polymerase and labelled with digoxygenin (DIG). In situ hybridization was performed as described previously [9, 94]. Briefly, UGS were dissected from embryos and fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4 % paraformaldehyde. At least three embryos were used for each sex and time point or condition. They were then processed for in situ hybridization with the DIG-labelled antisense riboprobe. For negative controls, a DIG-labelled sense riboprobe was generated for each gene. Alkaline phosphatase conjugated Anti-DIG antibodies were used, and the chromagen was BCIP/NBT. Following WISH, specimens were photographed again under bright field and were then over-stained before being imbedded in OCT for cryosectioning (sections were cut at 10, 14 and 18 μm). Staining was analysed by photography under bright field and photos taken of sections using 5x and 20x lenses. Both sense and antisense probes were initially tested for all genes. Staining was only observed with antisense probes, and not in the sense controls (data not shown).Urogenital tissues were dissected from chicken embryos and briefly fixed for 15 min in 4 % paraformaldehyde/PBS at room temperature. Tissues were then cryoprotected by immersion in 30 % sucrose/PBS (overnight at 4 °C), infiltrated with OCT embedding compound. Ten micron frozen sections on slides were treated as previously described [63]. Secondary antibodies were AlexFluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG, 1:1000, and AlexaFluor 594 donkey anti-mouse IgG, at 1:1500 from Invitrogen). Sections were mounted in Fluorosave (Calbiochem). Images were taken on a Zeiss Axiovision M1.Antibodies were raised against the chicken GPR56 and CAPN5 proteins at GenScript. Two affinity purified polyclonal rabbit antibodies were raised for each, against the peptides VSEPIDLTEGDYTTC or CHLQDRGNRRSNDLP for CAPN5 and CAFASPKEENREVQG or CWREDGTASSGNWDS, for GPR56. The FGFR3 antibody was from Bioss (bs-0165R) and used at 1:100.To test the GPR56 antibody in vitro, the GPR56 ORF was cloned from chicken gonad cDNA using the primers GPR56_Fow GAACCCAGGCTGAGAGCCAG, GPR56_Rev GCAAACACCCTCTGCCAGGC. Capn5_Fow GAAAGGATGTTTTCCTCA, Capn5_Rev TACACTTGCAGGTGGTAGA. GPR56 was cloned into the Tol2 plasmid under the CMV promoter. Chicken fibroblasts were transfected according to the Lipofectamine 2000 protocol (Life Technologies) with either empty or GPR56 Tol2 vector. Anti-GPR56 antibodies 1 and 2 were tested at various concentrations (1 :500, 1: 2000, 1:10,000) and assessed for specific staining using immunofluorescence as described above. CAPN5 ORF was cloned into the RCAS.BP.A avian retroviral vector. This was transfected into cells, which were passaged at least once to allow the spread of virus. These cells and control/uninfected cells were then fixed and stained with the two antibodies as above. Anti-P27 was used to check viral infection (not shown).RNA-seq data for both time points has been uploaded to the DDBJ database as part of the Chicken BioProject (ref number SRP014719).https://trace.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/DRASearch/study?acc=SRP014719.Disorders of sex developmentHamburger and Hamilton stageEmbryonic dayRNA sequencingGreen fluorescent proteinExtracellular matrixDifferential expressionFragments Per Kilobase of Exon Per Million Fragments MappedFalse discovery rateBiological processCellular componentMolecular functionKyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and GenomesUrogenital systemSpecific Pathogen Free embryosFold changeEggers S, Sinclair A.

Total genes were filtered for those showing only DE expression (P-value <0.001) at E6 and not E4.5, to isolate those genes that become dimorphically expressed as the gonad begin to differentiate. We removed well-characterized sex genes such as FOXL2 and SOX9 to allow identification of additionally activated pathways. This resulted in a list of 774 genes, which were subject to DAVID analysis. In the table expression (shown as FPKM) is shown for female and males at E4.5 and E6. P-values for the differences between females and males are shown for each time point (BH_PValue 4.5 or 6).

View our privacy policyAdvanced SearchWe have identified differences in gene expression in macrophages grown from the bone marrow of male and female chickens in recombinant chicken M-CSF (CSF1). Cells were profiled with or without treatment with bacterial LPS for 24 h. Approximately 600 transcripts were induced by prolonged LPS stimulation to an equal extent in the male and female macrophages. Many transcripts encoded on the Z chromosome were expressed ∼1.6-fold higher in males, reflecting a lack of dosage compensation in the homogametic sex. A smaller set of W chromosome–specific genes was expressed only in females. LPS signaling in mammals is associated with induction of type 1 IFN–responsive genes. Unexpectedly, because IFNs are encoded on the Z chromosome of chickens, unstimulated macrophages from the female birds expressed a set of known IFN-inducible genes at much higher levels than male cells under the same conditions. To confirm that these differences were not the consequence of the actions of gonadal hormones, we induced gonadal sex reversal to alter the hormonal environment of the developing chick and analyzed macrophages cultured from male, female, and female sex-reversed embryos. Gonadal sex reversal did not alter the sexually dimorphic expression of either sex-linked or IFN-responsive genes. We suggest that female birds compensate for the reduced dose of inducible IFN with a higher basal set point of IFN-responsive genes.Gender-specific differences in innate and acquired immunity have been well-documented in mammals (1, 2). In general, these differences are attributed to direct and indirect actions of the sex hormones. For example, a recent study demonstrated that the female-specific bias in type 1 diabetes incidence in the NOD mouse was an indirect consequence of the effect of androgens on the gut microbiota (3). Others have demonstrated an interaction between estrogen and type 1 IFN signaling in regulating susceptibility in SLE models (4). Of course, males and females also differ in chromosomal complement. In mammals, the Y chromosome contains relatively few genes, and the double complement of genes on the X chromosome in females is controlled by X chromosome inactivation. It has generally been assumed that there are few Y chromosome–encoded functions other than testis determination; however, recent studies concluded that the Y chromosome genes encode proteins associated with general cellular functions (5, 6), and there is emerging evidence for effects of Y chromosome sequence polymorphisms on innate immunity and autoimmune pathology in both mice and humans (7). In birds, the heterogametic sex is female (ZW). Analysis of mixed-sex chimeric (gynandromorph) birds indicated that somatic cells in the chicken have an inherent cell-autonomous sex identity (8, 9). In a series of experiments where undifferentiated cells were transplanted between early chick embryos of different sexes, and the resulting chimeric embryos allowed to develop to an advanced stage, the transplanted donor cells retained their donor sex identity. Male donor cells expressed male-specific transcripts even when fully integrated into a female gonad, and vice versa (9). Although some Z chromosome genes appear to be expressed at similar levels in male and female birds (i.e., compensated) (10), the large majority are not, and dosage compensation in birds appears to be regulated on a gene-by-gene basis (11–13)The type 1 IFN (IFN-α, IFN-β) clusters are located on the Z chromosome in birds (14). If IFN expression is not dosage compensated, one might anticipate that male birds would produce more effective defense against infections. However, the reverse appears to be the case. In a study involving a large number of chicken flocks (>300,000 male and female birds), mortality rates resulting from infectious diseases were ∼70% higher in males than in females (15). In this and other studies, the responses to bacterial, viral, and protein Ags were assayed, and females were found to both respond earlier and with higher Ab titers than males [e.g., to the major poultry pathogen Newcastle Disease virus (15, 16)]. IFN-β is a key regulator of antibacterial as well as antiviral responses in mammals. In murine macrophages responding to the TLR4 agonist, bacterial LPS, the transient induction of IFN-β via the MyD88-independent pathway and activation of transcription factors IRF1 and IRF3 leads to autocrine induction of IFN-responsive genes (17). LPS and IFN signaling is, in turn, subject to stringent feedback control by the inducible suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS1) (18, 19)Studies of macrophage responses to LPS in mice and pigs have exploited the ability to grow macrophage cells from the marrow in M-CSF (CSF1) (20–22). This system also permits the identification of macrophage autonomous genetic differences in gene expression between strains and breeds, since the cells from different individuals are cultivated in a common culture environment ex vivo (23). We previously cloned and expressed chicken CSF1 and showed that it can be used to produce chicken bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDM) (24). In the current study, we demonstrate that BMDM from male and female birds retain an intrinsic sex identity that includes differential expression of IFN-responsive autosomal genes.ISA Brown eggs obtained from the National Avian Research Facility at the Roslin Institute were incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 39°C either to hatch, or for the required time. For fadrozole-induced gonadal sex reversal, the eggs were injected with either 1 mg fadrozole (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS (10 mg/ml) or with PBS solution alone on day 3 of incubation (H&H Stage 18) and then reincubated for an additional 11 d for bone marrow collection. Embryos were then recovered and decapitated. Eggs were injected with the maximum tolerable dose of the aromatase inhibitor (1 mg/egg), and only treated embryos with gonads that had acquired a gross morphology that was fully male were used in our analysis. Gonad pairs were processed histologically and sections immunostained for the presence of male-specific and female-specific proteins. Abs were from AbD Serotec (aromatase) and from Millipore (SOX9).Femurs and tibias were collected from sexed hatchling birds, or in the case of the sex reversal experiments, from embryos at day 14 of development and stored on ice while the sex of individual embryos was determined. Bones were stripped of muscle and bone marrow flushed using a fine needle and RPMI 1640 medium, under sterile conditions. Four separate pools of material, each from five individual birds of the same sex and treatment, were generated in each experiment. Bone marrow cells were cultured on bacteriological plastic dishes as previously described (24) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 350 ng/ml recombinant chicken CSF1 (BMDM normal growth media) at 41°C for 1 wk to allow macrophage differentiation. At the end of this time, there is a confluent and pure population of macrophages. The macrophages were harvested by squirting them from the plate with medium, replated at a concentration of 106 cells/ml in 6-well plates, and incubated with or without a predefined maximal dose of LPS [100 ng/ml, Salmonella Minnesota R595; Sigma-Aldrich; as used in previous studies in mammals (22, 23)] prior to RNA harvest.Total RNA was extracted using RNA-Bee (AMS Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quality and quantity was assessed by Agilent Bioanalyser RNA 6000 Nanochip analysis and by Nanodrop spectroscopy (Thermo Scientific).Microarray analysis was performed by ARK Genomics using Affymetrix systems and reagents. Hybridization probes were generated using the Ambion WT labeling kit and 500 ng RNA. Signal intensities were measured using a GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G and analyzed with GeneChip Command Console Software (AGCC), applying RMA normalization to the CEL files. To ensure robust male:female comparisons, only probes with signal intensities above the average of the lowest quartile + 3 SDs were included in our analyses. Microarray data have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE59921) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank).Ensembl database entries were used to identify mammalian homologs for chicken genes and enrichment based on functional annotations determined by ToppFun analysis (ToppGene Suite; http://toppgene.cchmc.org/). The categories included in this analysis were: molecular function, biological process, cellular component, domain, pathway, interaction, and transcription factor binding site. The number of genes assigned to each category and the significance of the scores are shown. Only scores with p values ≤ 0.01 and representing a minimum of three genes are shown (assignments with a minimum of two genes are shown for the CASI-W analysis, because of the limited number of genes in this category).BMDM were differentiated from bone marrow collected from 15 male birds and 15 female birds between 1 and 3 d after hatch. The bone marrow was obtained from newly hatched chicks to ensure that any differences were not due to gonadal hormones produced by sexually mature birds. Material from five individual birds was combined to reduce any impact of interindividual variation, and six pools representing three male and three female biological replicates were generated. Macrophages were harvested and then replated and cultured with or without the addition of LPS. The Affymetrix Chicken Genome Array was used to determine relative gene expression between male and female macrophages both before LPS treatment and 24 h after stimulation with LPS. The late time point was chosen to focus specifically on the downstream targets of endogenous IFN-β, which is a known early-response gene in macrophages.To analyze the data, we initially used the network-based analytical tool, Biolayout Express3D (25). As shown in Fig. 1A, the dataset could be segregated into a substantial number of clusters of genes sharing similar patterns of transcription. Each of the clusters can be represented as an average expression profile of its members (Fig. 1B), highlighting patterns of particular interest. Four of the most informative clusters are shown in detail in Fig. 2. Fig. 2A shows one of the largest clusters, cluster 2, which contains some 600 probe sets. The genes within this cluster were equally expressed in macrophages from male and female birds, and induced to a similar extent in all three pooled replicates by 24-h LPS stimulation. It contains the very well studied lysozyme gene, which is known to be profoundly LPS-inducible in the chicken (26), and many other transcripts describe previously in a study of induction of gene expression in HD11 macrophage line by LPS (27). As noted in previous analyses of the responses of mouse, pig, and human macrophages to LPS (20–22), this late-responsive cluster includes many known feedback regulators of TLR4 signaling, such as Batf3, Dusp1, and Nfkbia. As in mammals, the LPS-induced cluster does contain both the type 1 (Ifnar1) and type II (Ifngr2) IFNRs. However, the known IFN-induced genes are absent from this set of LPS-induced genes, suggesting either that the MyD88-independent pathway was not activated in chicken BMDM, or that the two sexes differ in their response. One obvious possibility was that these genes would be more highly induced in the male cells because of the presence of the IFN clusters on the Z chromosome, but the only cluster conforming to that pattern, cluster 369, contained only three genes. Of these, only the chemokine gene annotated as IL8 (CXCL1; ∼2-fold more inducible in males, from a similar basal level to females) was highly expressed and has a known function.Network analysis of the gene expression profiles of male and female BMDM. Pools of bone marrow cells, each from five newly hatched male or female birds, were cultured in chCSF1 for 7 d, harvested, and cultured for an additional 24 h with or without LPS. mRNA was isolated and analyzed using Affymetrix expression arrays. The sets of coexpressed genes were identified using the network analysis tool Biolayout Express3D. The results are displayed in three dimensions, with nodes within each cluster given a common color, and each node joined by edges in blue. At left, the dataset clearly separates into four broad clusters, genes that are upregulated or downregulated by LPS to the same extent in each sex, and sets of genes that display female-, or male-enriched expression patterns. The clusters labeled cell autonomous sex identity (CASI) are largely encoded on the sex chromosomes. The panels at right show the average expression profiles of genes within distinct clusters showing male- or female-specific expression. From left to right, there are three control female samples (F1C, F2C, and F3C), then corresponding samples with LPS (F1-LPS, F2-LPS, and F3-LPS), three control males samples (M1-C, M2-C, and M3-C), and the corresponding samples treated with LPS (M1-LPS, M2-LPS, and M3-LPS).Gene expression profiles of clusters of coregulated genes in chicken BMDM. The figures show the average expression profiles of selected clusters of biological interest derived from the data in Fig. 1. From left to right in each panel, there are three control female samples (F1C, F2C, and F3C), then corresponding samples with LPS (F1-LPS, F2-LPS, and F3-LPS), three control males samples (M1-C, M2-C, and M3-C), and the corresponding samples treated with LPS (M1-LPS, M2-LPS, and M3-LPS). In each panel, the box at right lists the annotated transcripts within each cluster.Cluster 3 contains ∼330 clone sets, and the average expression profile displays ∼1.5-fold enrichment in all the male-derived samples (Fig. 2B). Many of these transcripts are encoded on the Z chromosome, summarized in detail in Supplemental Table IA. The data confirm the significance of the differential expression, and the tight clustering of relative expression in macrophages from males at an average of 1.63-fold enrichment compared with the female. A corresponding small cluster of transcripts (cluster 15; Fig. 2C) derived from the W chromosome was detected only in macrophages from female birds. None of these differentially expressed sex chromosome encoded transcripts in either males or females has a known function in the regulation of innate immune function.The reason why known IFN-inducible genes are absent from the common LPS-induced cluster (cluster 2) is that they formed two separate clusters (clusters 8 and 18; Fig. 2D), in which the expression was higher in macrophages from female than male birds, and was also significantly different between the individual pools from females. The expression pattern in females has a dominant influence on the correlation coefficient that underlies the clustering method, and obscured the fact that many of these genes are, in fact, LPS-inducible in males. Supplemental Table IB summarizes the data for all of the genes that were significantly more highly expressed in the macrophages from females, and Supplemental Table IC summarizes a GO analysis, highlighting the clear enrichment in known IFN-responsive transcripts. Fig. 3 shows the small subset of genes within this set that is inducible by LPS in the BMDM from males to the level seen constitutively in females (see also more detailed descriptions in Supplemental Table ID). A notable member of this set is the inducible feedback regulator of IFN signaling, SOCS1 (18, 19).Gene expression profiles of individual LPS-responsive genes in BMDM from male and female birds. Representative expression profiles of a subset of genes expressed constitutively at higher levels in macrophages from female birds and induced in male birds. The results are the average of three separate pools. The primary data, additional annotation and other genes with this profile are provided in Supplemental Table ID.To summarize, there is a large set of transcripts that distinguishes cells from male and female birds, most of which are associated with the sex chromosomes, and the macrophages of female birds express IFN-responsive genes constitutively.Despite the common tissue culture environment and the extensive proliferation of progenitors that occurs in the cell culture used to generate BMDM, there is a formal possibility that differential gene expression is an epigenetic consequence of the organizational effects of male and female embryonic hormones. To eliminate this possibility, we produced sex-reversed birds. Sex reversal of the ZW gonad was achieved by treatment with an inhibitor of aromatase enzyme activity (fadrozole), which prevents the production of estrogen from androgens and produces gonadal sex reversal in female birds (28). Eggs were injected with either fadrozole ([1 mg/egg] or with PBS on day 3 of incubation [H&H Stage 18]) and then reincubated for an additional 11 d to collect bone marrow. Gonads from genetic female embryos treated with fadrozole expressed the testis-associated marker Sox9, showed reduced levels of the aromatase enzyme, and acquired the gross morphology and internal structures (sex cords) typical of a developing testis (Fig. 4). The Affymetrix Chicken Gene 1.0 ST Array was used to monitor gene expression in macrophages from male, female, and sex-reversed female embryos. In effect, this is a complete replication of the analysis, albeit using marrow from an earlier developmental stage. The complete datasets are provided in Supplemental Tables II and III. Fadrozole had no significant effect on the expression of the Z chromosome genes, which continued to be expressed in a sexually dimorphic fashion in male and female macrophages derived from sex-reversed embryos (Supplemental Table IIIB). Crucially, the female-biased expression of IFN-target genes was not suppressed (masculinized) by altering the embryonic hormonal environment from female to male (Supplemental Table IIIC).Effect of fadrozole on expression of sex-specific proteins in the chick embryo gonads. Panels show images generated from histological sections through the left and right gonads of a PBS-treated female embryo, the left and right gonads of a PBS-treated male embryo, and the left and right gonads of a fadrozole-treated female embryo. Images show each section stained with the nuclear dye, Hoechst (blue), and immunostained for expression of Aromatase (green) and SOX9 (red). Fadrozole-treated female gonads clearly adopt a testicular morphology and show reduced levels of aromatase and obvious expression of the male-specific SOX9. Scale bars, 20 μm.Although there have been a number of reports on the transcriptomic response of chicken macrophage cell lines to LPS (27), to our knowledge, this is the first study of primary chicken BMDM that illustrates their use as a system. In mouse (21) and pig (23), analysis of BMDM provided a system in which cells from different individuals or strains can be assayed in a common culture system, removed from effects of other cell types or environment. The response to LPS in macrophages is a complex transcriptional cascade (21, 29–31), starting with immediate early genes transcribed from poised RNA-pol II complexes and followed by induction of downstream targets by the early gene products (32). Those products include both inducible transcription factors and autocrine regulators including the many proinflammatory cytokines.At the same time, there is the induction of a large cohort of feedback regulators, so-called inflammation suppressor genes (33), which will eventually damp the inflammatory response and return the cells by 18–24 h to a new steady state that is resistant to further stimulation by LPS. In the current study, we focused specifically on that later 24-h time point. By that time, we noted the induced expression of some 600 transcripts that were shared by macrophages from males and females, including many of the known feedback regulators. No doubt there are many more such regulators among the large set of genes on the array platform that await informative annotation.A recent eQTL analysis of the response of human peripheral blood monocytes to LPS identified a cohort of genes induced at 24 h that was correlated in trans with sequence variation at the IFN-β locus (34). In mammalian (18, 21) and avian (27) macrophages, IFN-β is an immediate early gene and induced transiently by LPS; we anticipated that measurement of the downstream target genes would provide a more sensitive indication of any differential regulation of the pathway between male and female macrophages as a consequence of the presence of the IFN cluster on the Z chromosome. The pattern we observed was the direct reverse of the anticipated outcome; the macrophages from the female birds expressed many known IFN-responsive genes constitutively, associated with relatively higher expression of the IFN-responsive transcription factors IRF1 and IRF7 (Supplemental Table IB). We were not able to detect IFN-β mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR in either male or female cells (data not shown) or on the arrays. However, like the response to LPS, the response to exogenous type 1 IFN in mouse macrophages is transient and is subject to inducible feedback control, notably by SOCS1 (18, 21). Interestingly, commonly used mouse strains, C57BL/6 and BALB/c also differ in the basal expression of many known IFN-responsive genes, an observation that has been attributed to low level constitutive expression of IFN-β in the C57BL/6 line (21). Accordingly, we suggest that the underlying mechanism is that BMDM of the chicken, like those of the mouse, produce endogenous IFN at low levels. In males, with the entire cluster of type 1 IFN genes on the Z chromosome, the level of expression induces both a larger initial response and a more complete shutdown. In females, the lower expression of IFN also produces a less-effective induction of feedback regulators, and the overall induction of IFN target genes is sustained. However, it is also possible that other Z chromosome– or W chromosome–encoded transcripts contribute to the shutdown of IFN-responsive genes in males or their sustained induction in females.We can only infer that the differential expression of the IFN-responsive genes in females underlies their greater resistance to pathogens. Most studies of avian infectious disease susceptibility, including studies of pathogen-induced gene expression use mixed populations of males and females and made no distinctions between their responses. Similarly, we do not have direct evidence that the differences in expression of IFN-responsive gene expression are due to lack of dosage compensation on the Z chromosome. The original study that localized the genes to the Z chromosome addressed this question but could not demonstrate differences in IFN production between the sexes because of a high degree of variation in virus-induced expression between individuals of both sexes (35). Interestingly, even though we examined pools of macrophages from five birds, there was substantial variation between the pools in expression of the IFN-inducible genes as a class (Fig. 2D), which is likely to be associated with variation in the common regulator, IFN. Genes on the Z chromosome have evolved more rapidly than the autosomes in avian species (36). Because functional variation in the single copy of the IFN loci in the female line would immediately impact upon antiviral defense and the vast majority of viruses have evolved mechanism to evade or compromise IFN-mediated defenses (37), one would expect the IFN genes to be especially subject to selection. Chicken BMDM cultured as described herein can be infected with several viral pathogens including Marek’s disease virus and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). However, despite the basla differences in expression of IFN-responsive genes, we did not observe any difference in the replication of infectious bronchitis virus when macrophages from male and female birds were compared (K.A. Sauter and L. Vervelde, unpublished observations). The BMDM system could be used to assess the impact of genetic variation on the response to viral or bacterial pathogen challenge, or the effect of genetic background as we have done previously in the pig (23). Clearly, such studies in birds would need to examine the responses of male and female birds separately.The use of sex-reversed birds demonstrated clearly that the sexually dimorphic characteristics are inherent features of male and female macrophages and unrelated to prior gonadal hormone exposure. Aside from the IFN genes, the male and female macrophages differed from each other in their expression of many other genes on the Z and W chromosomes. The majority of these genes are also differentially expressed in other embryonic and adult tissues and seem to be the hallmarks of cell-autonomous sex identity (D. Zhao, D. McBride, S. Nandi, and M. Clinton, manuscript in preparation). Our findings would support the proposal by Mank and Ellegren (13) that the limited sex chromosome dosage compensation in birds occurs on a gene-by-gene, rather than a chromosome-wide basis, as appears to be the case for random allelic inactivation on the autosomes in mammals (38). None of the genes overexpressed in a male-specific manner has a known immune function, but the female-specific W chromosome–associated genes (Supplemental Table IIB) are significantly enriched for genes that interact with IFN-stimulated gene 15, a ubiquitin-like protein that is conjugated to intracellular target proteins upon IFN activation (39). So, like the mammalian Y chromosome, the avian W could potentially have genes that contribute to immune regulation and certainly does contribute to a novel female macrophage-associated transcriptome.The authors have no financial conflicts of interest.We thank Helen Brown for advice on statistics and the Roslin Poultry Service for supplying fertilized eggs.↵1 M.C. and D.A.H. are joint last authors.This work was supported by Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council Grant BB/H012486/1.

A number of orphan nuclear receptors including steroidogenic factor 1, liver receptor homologue 1, dosage-sensitive sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia critical region, on chromosome X, gene 1, and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors I/II as well as the GATA family members, GATA2 and GATA4, have also been implicated in transcriptional regulation of the gonadotropin genes. We hypothesized that hormonally mediated changes in these latter transcription factors may provide an additional mechanism for mediating hormonal effects beyond the more classically appreciated pathways. In these studies, we demonstrate significant regulation of orphan nuclear receptor and GATA messenger RNA levels by GnRH, dihydrotestosterone, estradiol, and progesterone in both cultured primary pituitary cells and gonadotrope-derived cell line, LβT2. These results advance our understanding of the complex mechanisms by which GnRH and steroid hormones achieve precise regulation of anterior pituitary function.This is a preview of subscription content, log in to check access.Burger LL, Haisenleder DJ, Marshall JC.

On the third day of incubation, fertile eggs were randomly assigned to five experimental groups comprising (i) Fadrozole (0.1 mg/egg), (ii) rhIGF-I (100 ng/egg), (iii) Fadrozole (0.1 mg/egg) + rhIGF-I (100 ng/egg), (iv) vehicle injection (10 mM acetic acid and 0.1% BSA), and (v) non-injected eggs. Eggs in the rhIGF-I-injected groups showed the mode of hatching time at the 480th hour of incubation, 12 hours earlier compared to the other groups, with no statistically significant difference in mortality and hatchability. On Day 1 and 42 of production, 90% of genetically female chicks were masculinized using Fadrozole treatment, while 100% female-to-male phenotypic sex reversal was observed in the Fadrozole+rhIGF-I group. Fadrozole equalized the body weight of both genders, although rhIGF-I was effective on the body weight of male chicks only. Interestingly, combined rhIGF-I and Fadrozole could increase the body weight in both sexes compared to the individual injections (P<0.05). These findings revealed that (i) IGF-I-treated chicken embryos were shown to be an effective option for overcoming the very long chicken deprivation period, (ii) the simultaneous treatment with Fadrozole and IGF-I could maximize the female-to-male sex reversal chance, (iii) the increase in the body weight of masculinized chickens via Fadrozole could be equal to their genetically male counterparts, and (iv) the IGF-I effectiveness, specifically along with the application of aromatase inhibitors in female chicks, indicates that estrogen synthesis could be a stumbling block for the IGF-I action mechanism in female embryos.Citation: Mohammadrezaei M, Toghyani M, Gheisari A, Toghyani M, Eghbalsaied S (2014) Synergistic Effect of Fadrozole and Insulin-Like Growth Factor-I on Female-To-Male Sex Reversal and Body Weight of Broiler Chicks.

Unlike mammals, genetically male birds are homozygous (ZZ) and the females are heterozygous (ZW) [2], [3]. It is thought that, like in mammals, one or both of the chicken sex chromosomes carry genes which control the cellular decision-making process for gonad development, resulting in ovary development in ZW hens and testis in ZZ roosters [4]. The onset of gonadal sex differentiation in birds is sensitive to steroid hormones [5]. Estrogen is required for ovarian development and control proliferation of the left gonadal cortex [6]. Moreover, 17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and aromatase enzymes which are responsible for the conversion of androgens to estradiol-17 β are only detectable in the female embryos’ gonads [7]. Accordingly, estradiol can be detected from E9 to E15 in female chicken embryonic gonads by monitoring the production of estradiol-17β [8].The importance of aromatase is underscored by numerous studies showing that aromatase inhibitors, such as Fadrozole, induce female-to-male sex reversal in ZW females when administered before or during sexual differentiation [9]–[11]. After a treatment on the third day of egg incubation with 1-methyl-androstendion, a steroidal aromatase inhibitor, or with Fadrozole, a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, gonads of 12-day-old female embryos looked like testis and exhibited different grades of sex reversal [12]. In another study, the administration of Fadrozole prior to the incubation indicated that gonads of the majority of females had a visual appearance of testes at the hatching time [11]. Recently, Li et al. [13] showed that injection of Fadrozole before gonadal sex differentiation on the third day of incubation can induce female-to-male sex reversal in broiler chickens. On the other hand, the male-to-female chicken sex reversal can be directed by the addition of estrogen [6] or aromatase over-expression [1] during sexual differentiation, pointing out the linearity in the aromatase-estrogen pathway.Insulin-like growth factors, IGF-1 and IGF-2, play essential roles in mammalian and avian growth and development as a mediator of growth hormone, either as endocrine or autocrine-paracrine effectors [14]. The positive impact of in ovo administration of IGF-I on embryonic and postnatal growth and development, particularly skeletal muscles, is well documented in broiler chicks and quails [15]–[17]. Although IGF-I has been fully documented as a growth hormone in various species, its interaction with aromatase/anti-aromatase has not been well explored. It has been reported that IGF-I plays an important role in the regulation of testicular steroid biosynthesis, testicular growth, and development [18]. However, the regulation of aromatase gene expression using IGF-I manipulation appears to be different between mammalian Sertoli and granulosa cells [19], [20].Male broiler chicks have a faster growth rate and better feed efficiency than females and are thus of particular economic interest for farmers. Even though acceptable sex reversal rate has been achieved through aromatase inhibitors, female-to-male sex-reversed chicks do not gain much weight compared to the genetically male chickens [1], [11]. Treatment of chicken embryos by IGF-I, as an important growth inducer, could be effective for overcoming the lower weight gain drawback of sex-reversed chicks. However, IGF-I effectiveness on the body weight gain is exclusively limited to the male chicks [16], [21], [22], and it still needs to be investigated if inhibiting estrogen synthesis could trigger the IGF-I efficiency in genetically female chicks. In addition, the possible synergistic or antagonistic impacts of anti-aromatase and IGF-I on chicken sex reversal have not been studied. Thus, the objective of the current study was to investigate the effect of in ovo administration of Fadrozole and recombinant human (rh) IGF-I on female-to-male sex reversal and body weight of broiler chicks. Hatching characteristics were also investigated to detect possible detrimental treatment effects.On Day 4 of incubation, an in ovo injection was carried out over a large distance from the embryo location to minimize the physical damages done to the embryos. Eggs which did not hatch until Day 22 of incubation were cracked by the staff, and the dead embryos were used for genotyping. No mortality was observed during the production period in all treatment groups. In each measurement session, each chick was handled only for few minutes to avoid unnecessary stress and improve chicken refinements. By the end of Day 42 of production, chicks from all groups were promptly and humanely killed by a panel of experts and used for morphological evaluations. It should be borne in mind that the researchers of the current study had recruited two enthusiastic, well-trained, and skilled staff to thoroughly monitor the chicken’s behavior and physical appearance, as well as feed and water intakes throughout the production period. All the experimental procedures were assessed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Ethics Committee in Islamic Azad University, Khorasgan Branch, Isfahan, Iran, and all national and institutional guidelines were appropriately followed.A total number of 550 fertilized commercial eggs coming from the Ross broiler (308) chickens were collected and incubated under standard conditions (temperature 37.5±0.2°C, relative humidity 65±2%). On the third day of incubation, 85 hours following the eggs being placed in the incubator, all the set eggs were candled and the air sacks were located. Fertile eggs (65±1.5 g) were randomly divided into five groups with four replicates of 24 eggs; namely i) a Fadrozole hydrochloride-injected (#F3806, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany; 0.1 mg per egg) group, ii) a recombinant human (rh) IGF-I injected (#SRP3069, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany; 100 ng per egg) group, iii) Fadrozole hydrochloride (0.1 mg per egg) + rhIGF-I (100 ng per egg) injected group, iv) a vehicle injected sham control group containing 10 mM acetic acid (#A3686, PanReac AppliChem, Germany) and 0.1% Bovine serum albumin (#A2153, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), and v) a non-injected control group. Prior to the injections, the shell surface was wiped using 70% ethanol and a small tiny hole was drilled on the surface of the air sack. Injections were made into the albumen right under the air sack using 23-gauge needles cut to 13 mm, then the holes were sealed with liquid paraffin and the eggs were replaced in the incubator in order to be hatched.To determine the period after which the incubated eggs hatched (“hatching time”), the hatched chicks from each group was recorded every 3 hours from 456 to 510 hours of incubation. To follow the standards [23], all the chicks in each group were kept in the hatchery until six hours after the last hatching event and then they were sexed and reared for six weeks. Therefore, we could not determine chicken gender at the exact time of hatching. The hatched chicks were individually weighed and 8 chicks per replicate were randomly distributed into floor pens covered by sawdust as litter (10 birds/m2) and raised for 6 weeks. A corn-soybean diet was formulated to meet or exceed the nutrient requirements of broilers offered by the Ross Broiler Manual (2007) for different periods provided ad libitum throughout the experiment.On the day of hatch, the phenotypic sex of randomly selected hatched chicks was evaluated through vent sexing by expert staffs. In summary, following squeezing the vent by fingers and expelling the chick dropping, the vent was opened, and the presence of a bump was considered as the male indicator. Afterwards, these chicks were slaughtered and their liver samples were collected and used to determine their sexual ZZ or ZW genotype. Next, all birds reared for 6 weeks, and the presence or absence of the testis was considered to determine the chicken phenotypic sex following slaughter on Day 42 of production.Genomic DNA was extracted from the liver samples collected on the hatching day or Day 42 after hatch, and then the genetic sex was identified by PCR from the CHD1 gene [24]. The principle of identifying genetic sex via CHD1 was based on the number of amplified fragments. That is, one or two bands are detectable in genetically male or female chicks, respectively [25].On Day 1, 2.5 ml of blood was collected by puncturing the heart from four randomly selected birds per replicate (16 chicks per treatment). Blood samples were immediately aliquoted into non-anticoagulant tubes and allowed to clot for 2 hours at 37°C. Then the serum samples were isolated by centrifugation at 2000×g for 10 minutes and stored at −20°C for later analysis. Serum samples were thawed and glucose, total protein, and triglyceride levels were determined using an auto analyzer following the instructions of the corresponding reagent kit (Autolab, PM 4000, Autoanalyzer Medical System, Rome, Italy).The collected data of hatchability, sexual mortality, and the rate of sex reversal were analyzed by χ2 test. The data obtained from serum biochemical parameters and productive performance attributes of genetically male and female sexes were subjected to the analysis of variance using the general linear model (GLM) procedure in SAS 9.2 package (each sex in isolation). The Tukey post-hoc test was used to assess any significant differences among treatments in each sex. In addition, an independent t-test was used to perform a mean comparison between genetically male and female chicks in each group. Since the frequency distribution of hatching time can be an important factor for the chicken quality dispersion through the duration of early deprivation period, further descriptive statistics including skewness and kurtosis were measured by Microsoft Office Excel 2007. The P-value set at ≤0.05 was considered as the significant level for mean comparisons. All values are presented as mean ± SEM, unless indicated otherwise.In this study, we evaluated if the administration of Fadrozole and IGF-I, alone or in combination, could affect the hatching traits of broiler chickens. Along with the graphical distribution of hatching time (Figure 1A), we measured skewness (Figure 1B), which demonstrates the amount and direction of departure from horizontal symmetry, and kurtosis (Figure 1C), which reflects the mass movement of hatching time events at peak, tails, and shoulders of the distribution [26]. In the control groups, hatching occurred between 456 and 508 hours post-incubation (Figure 1A) and its distribution was slightly left-skewed (Figure 1.B). Moreover, the mode of hatching time was observed at the 492nd hour of incubation in the control group. Fadrozole noticeably decreased the kurtosis criterion of the frequency distribution (Figure 1.C), without changing the skewed distribution. The mode of hatching time was observed 12 hours earlier in IGF-I injected eggs, irrespective of whether Fadrozole was present or not. However, the complementation of Fadrozole with rhIGF-I slightly increased the kurtosis and hatching events around the average. There were no significant differences in hatchability among experimental groups (Table 1). Embryo mortality was not statistically affected by the treatments, although the number of dead female embryos was higher than males in all experimental groups (Table 1).(A) Graphical presentation of hatching time in Control, Sham injection control, Fadrozole (0.1 mg), IGF-I (100 ng), Fadrozole (0.1 mg) + IGF-I (100 ng) groups. All injections were carried out on Day 3 of egg incubation over a long distance from the embryo location.

Even though allocation of fertilized eggs to each group was carried out randomly, a high level of genotypic sex ratio distortion was observed among different groups. Genotypic and phenotypic sexing were in complete agreement for the control, sham injection, and rhIGF-I groups. However, this consistency was not observed for the chicks in either of Fadrozole administrated groups (P≤0.05). Fadrozole injection on Day 3 of incubation led to 89.5% female-to-male sex reversal, while Fadrozole combined with rhIGF-I completely reversed the female phenotype. To see if the female-to-male sex reversal is a stable or transient phenomenon, chickens on 42 days of production from each group were further used for phenotypic and genotypic sexing (Table 3). In agreement with the Day 1, sex-reversal data, 90% of genetically female chicks were masculinized using Fadrozole manipulation on Day 42 of production. Additionally, the synergistic effect of rhIGF-I and Fadrozole, 100% female-to-male sex reversal, was also verified at the end of production period.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103570.t002https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103570.t003The treatment effects on serum constituents which were tested on the day of hatching are summarized in Table 4. Birds from both male and female genotypes which received the rhIGF-I had significantly higher serum protein (g/100 ml), triglyceride (mg/dl) and glucose (mg/dl) concentrations compared to the other groups (P≤0.05). However, no significant difference was observed between genetically male and female chicks in all groups for the evaluated biochemical parameters.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103570.t004The body weight of genetically male and female chicks on Day 1 and 42 of production are presented in Figure 2. Initial body weight at Day 1 was not significantly different between males and females in the control groups (Figure 2A). Fadrozole injection increased the weight of females, with slight impact on the male body weight. On the other hand, IGF-I supplementation considerably improved the male weight gain without changing the female average weight. This resulted in significant difference between male and female body weight in this group. The combined application of Fadrozole and IGF-I further improved the Day 1 body weight of both males and females compared to other groups. Following up the body weight till Day 42 of production (Figure 2B) indicated that unlike Day 1 weight records, there were significant different between male and female chicks in both non-injected and sham injection control groups. At this stage, Fadrozole increased the average weight of male chicks as much as that of the female chicks. This was the only group in which females showed numerically higher weight compared to the male chicks. In accordance with the Day 1 records, IGF-I significantly affected only the male chicks, with no considerable effect on females. Thus, Fadrozole attenuated the weight differences between the two genders, while IGF-I intensified the male weight gain. In accordance with the Day 1 data, simultaneous administration of Fadrozole and IGF-I increased Day 42 body weight of both males and females equally.The impact of chicken embryo treatment on Day 3 of incubation with Fadrozole (0.1 mg) and IGF-I (100 ng) on the average body weight (g) is depicted in (A) 1-day-old and (B) 42-day-old chicks. For the data analysis, chicks were divided into male and female sub-groups, based on ZZ/ZW genotype. Mean comparisons among five groups for each sex were carried out using Tukey post-hoc test in general linear model (GLM) procedure. In addition, mean comparison between male and female sub-groups of each treatment was conducted using an independent t-test, and the significant differences are denoted by an asterisk (*). abGroups with identical superscripts in each specific gender denote no significant difference (P≥0.05).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103570.g002In the current study, chicken embryos were treated with recombinant human IGF-I and Fadrozole, as a nonsteroidal anti-aromatase reagent, on Day 3 of incubation. We evaluated the simultaneous and separate effects of these two compounds on female-to-male sex reversal and body weight on the Day 1 and 42 of production as well as the hatching traits. Strong similarity of human and chicken IGF-I protein sequence [27], [28], very high affinity of rhIGF-I to the chicken IGF-I receptors [29], and successful usage of rhIGF-I for improving chicken body weight [16], [22] persuaded us to use rhIGF-I in the current study. We showed that IGF-I combination with Fadrozole could enhance female-to-male sex reversal, shorten hatching time, and increase chicken body weight.Sex-reversal was the main agenda of this project. Determination of chicken gender was carried out based on vent phenotype and ZW genotype on the first day of production. Based on phenotype and genotype sexing being in complete agreement, neither sham injection nor rhIGF treatment induced sex-reversal. By contrast, Fadrozole effectively converted females to male chicks with 90% efficiency. The obtained results for Day 1 was consistent with previous reports on aromatase-inhibitors [30], [31]. Aromatase, the key enzyme responsible for estrogen synthesis [32], expresses specifically in the female chicken gonads on the Day 5 of incubation, the time of gonadal sex differentiation [32], [33]. Thus, estrogen synthesis during chicken embryonic stages is restricted to female [32], although the expression of estrogen receptors commences prior to the gonadal differentiation, on Day 4.5 in both male and female chicks [4], [32], [33]. The difference in expression pattern of P450 AROM, CYP19 gene, could be attributed to alternate active promoters in different tissues [34]. Recently, it has been shown that aromatase over-expression prior to sex differentiation can induce male-to-female chicken sex reversal [1]. We further evaluated the post-hatch stability of the sex-reversal and repeated our early results on Day 42 of production. Stability of chicken sex-reversal by anti-aromatases has been controversial among researchers and was suggested to be anti-aromatase dose-dependent [30], [31]. However, we found that using low dosage of an anti-aromatase, irreversible female-to-male sex-reversal could be achieved. This discrepancy might partly be due to the differences in the quality and activity of Fadrozole produced by different companies.Even though IGF-I did not lead to sex-reversal in this study, 100% of genetically female chicks associated with male characteristics when a combination of IGF-I and Fadrozole was injected in ovo. The masculine phenotypes were permanently observed in the genetically female chicks through 42 days of production. Application of growth hormones (GH) improved spermatogenesis, serum testosterone, estradiol and serum IGF-I [35]. Further studies clearly proved that the GH mechanism of action is mediated through IGF-I synthesis [36]. Following IGF-I treatment of humans and mice suffering from primary growth hormone resistance, serum IGF-I level increased drastically and led to a substantial increase in serum LH, FSH and testicular testosterone [37], [38]. Moreover, polymorphisms in androgen receptor [39], estrogen receptors [40] and aromatase [39], [40] genes have been shown effective on human sperm concentration and motility. In addition to FSH and LH, IGF-I is thus an essential requirement for sexual development and testicular function (see [41] for a review). The mechanism of action for IGF-I effects on the reproduction system has not been fully understood but could involve regulation of the aromatization process [19], [42]. The administration of IGF-I reduced aromatase gene expression in Sertoli cells through interfering with either the production or the degradation of mRNAs [19]. It had similar effects to FSH in terms of increasing cellular proliferation, lactate production as well as glucose and amino acid transfer [43]. FSH can quickly down-regulate the IGF-I binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) gene expression and increase IGF-I activity [43]. Moreover, the IGF-I inhibitory effect of IGFBP-3 is dose-dependent and can be surpassed by higher concentration of IGF-I [43]. This anti-aromatase activity of IGF-I in Sertoli cells is in contrast to enhancing aromatase activity in granulosa cells [42]. IGF-I treatment of human and mouse granulosa cells increased estradiol synthesis [20], [44], [45] and P450AROM activity [46]. It has also been confirmed that the IGFBP-3 action mechanism could attenuate FSH-stimulated estrogen and progesterone in the granulosa cell [47]. Moreover, changes in androstenedione levels following IGF-I manipulation also differed in females versus males [37], [48]. Chicken gonads are uncommitted until Day 4.5, retaining the potential to be either ovary or testis. If the aromatase-stimulating activity of IGF-I takes place in chicken granulosa cells [1], it should interfere with the anti-aromatase activity of Fadrozole treatment and subsequently decreases the female-to-male sex reversal chance. However, the female-to-male sex-reversal event was favored by the simultaneous treatment of IGF-I and the anti-aromatase agent in this study.We further investigated if the sex-reversal event is associated with the chicken body weight gain. Fadrozole significantly increased the initial body weight of genetically female chicks. Estrogen enhances skeletal muscle catabolism, while testosterone increases skeletal muscle anabolism [49]. The positive effects of androgens on muscle mass could be mediated through IGF-I expression in avian muscles [50]. It is noteworthy that in our study Fadrozole also significantly increased the post-hatch body weight of genetically male chicks. To our knowledge, this is the first report on stimulating the male chicken weight gain by using an anti-aromatase agent. Fadrozole-treated embryos, with or without IGF-I, were the only group in which no significant difference was observed between genetically male and female chicks by the end of Day 42 of the production period. Even though lack of expression [32], [33] or very weak expression [7], [51] of the aromatase gene was observed in the early embryonic stages of male chick gonads, its considerable expression was recorded in the chicken matured testis [33] and human early prepubertal testis [52]. Therefore, the anti-aromatase compounds are less likely to be helpful during sex differentiation, and possible auxiliary effects probably occur during the post-differentiation period after Day 9.5. We injected Fadrozole and IGF-I compounds over a wide region in the embryo position, rather than in its adjacent area. This should have decreased the bulk access and uptake of these reagents at the sexual differentiation stage and extend their availability in the chicken egg media. With respect to the latter, a series of protease inhibitors, including ovomucoid [53], ovostatin [54] or ovomacroglubulin [55], ovoinhibitors [53], [56], and chicken cystatin (Barrett, 1981), exist in chicken egg albumen [see [57] for review]. These protease inhibitors can strongly inhibit various types of proteases [see [57] for review], protect the injected proteins from degradation assays and extend their half-life.IGF-I substantially increased male chick body weight at Day 1 and subsequently Day 42 of production. IGF-I plays a crucial role in the growth and development during embryonic period as well as post-hatch period [58]. Over the past years, the role of IGF-I as a potent mitogen which can stimulate satellite cell activation has also been illustrated [59]–[61]. IGF-I receptors are distributed in various organs, including brain, pituitary, gonads, and reproductive tracts [41]. This suggests that every component of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis could be the action site for IGF-I through endocrine and paracrine systems [41]. However, in agreement with previous publications [16], [21], [22], IGF-I impact was restricted to the male chicks. This indicates the presence of very strong interaction between sexual hormones and IGF-I. Estrogen synthesis is the key difference between chicken genders [32], [33]. If estrogen blocks the IGF-I receptors or induces the IGFBP-3, inhibiting estrogen synthesis by aromatase inhibitors should de-escalate the insensibility of genetically female embryos to IGF-I protein. Interestingly, results of this study clearly showed that this hypothesis could be true and genetically female embryos, which received both Fadrozole and IGF-I, had significantly higher body weight compared to those which received either IGF-I or Fadrozole. Despite intense research in other areas, such as the nervous system [62] and cancer [63]–[65], the exact IGF-I/estrogen interaction underlying weight gain has not been fully elucidated. In summary, synergistic effects of Fadrozole and IGF-I on sex-reversal and weight gain of broiler chicks, could be promising for further improving the broiler chicks industry, as well as finding new therapeutic systems in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) [66] or growth disorders.Along with the sex-reversal and weight gain of chicks, we evaluated if the IGF-I and Fadrozole effects can influence the hatching traits, as important factors in the chicken hatchery section. Our results confirm that hatchability and mortality traits were not affected by the treatment groups. However, application of higher doses of Fadrozole led to remarkable decrease in hatchability [10], [11], [31], [67]. The non-significant effect of treatment groups on mortality and hatchability might be partly due to the injection site. Genotypic sexing of dead embryos revealed that the number of dead female embryos was higher than that of the male counterparts. This finding confirms previous reports of higher early death in female embryos in some bird species [13], [68]. Furthermore, the sex-reversed groups, similar to other groups, had a higher mortality rate of genetically female compared to male embryos. These observations may further illustrate that the difference in early embryonic survival rates of females and males are likely due to the difference in the number of alleles for genes which are located on the Z chromosome but are not involved in the sexual differentiation.Results from each 3-hour inspection period of hatchery machine showed that the hatching time was left-skewed and indicated abundance of late hatchers in the control groups. Supplementation of Fadrozole into chicken eggs increased the number of hatched chicks around the mode and afterwards increased the number of late hatchers. The spread of hatching time can be escalated up to 48 hours for late versus early hatchers [23]. Therefore, practically, chicks are deprived from water and feed for up to 72 hours post-hatching [69]. On the other hand, early hatchers suffer more from being fasted compared to the late hatchers [23], have slower growth rate and immune system activity [69]–[71], and comprised the majority of low quality chickens [70]. Moreover, the compulsory holdup feed access is a main aggravating factor for long storage duration of hatched chicks [70]. Therefore, increasing the number of late hatchers can attenuate detrimental effects of the early deprivation period.Inclusion of recombinant human IGF-I into chicken egg albumen, with or without Fadrozole, noticeably advanced the hatching time. Shortening the hatching window through setting and hatching period was suggested as an important pathway to attenuate possible detrimental effects of the quite long early deprivation period [69]. The effects of IGF-I on shortening hatching time could be attributed to accelerating embryo development [23] and subsequently body weight gain of chicken embryos. Since we needed to wait until all the eggs hatched and then removed them from the incubator [23], we could not differentiate the gender of chickens at the exact hatching time. However, this could be worthy note to distinguish the gender effect at the hatching time and assess the possible associations between the gender, body weight and hatching time variables. Additionally, the IGF-I and Fadrozole combination improved the symmetrical shape of the distribution by decreasing the departure from normality and slightly increased the mass of hatches around the average. The more uniform hatching events through IGF-I plus Fadrozole treatment were associated with the less dispersed body weight at Day 1 of production. This could be of high importance in broiler chicken industry, since the spread of the hatching time and the maintenance condition following the hatch in the hatchery machine is a crucial step in the production of Day 1 old chicks [72]. In the current study, application of IGF-I substantially advanced the hatching time and improved the spread of hatches. In addition, comparison of serum biochemical parameters showed that chicks received IGF-I had higher serum glucose and total protein and fatty acids compared to other groups. These could be indicated as higher metabolic rate, available energy sources and healthy parameters [69] in the IGF-I treated chicks. Although lower plasma glucose and T3 was observed in chicks from early hatching period [23], IGF-1 treated chicks hatched earlier and showed significantly higher serum biochemical parameters in the current study. Taken together, in ovo treatment of chicken embryos with IGF-I alleviated the newly hatched chick’s early feeding problems in several ways, including shortened and normalized hatching time, increased spread of hatch around the average, and enhanced serum biochemical parameters of the hatchers.Authors would like to appreciate Drs.

The production of estrogen occurs via a well-characterised steroidogenic pathway, which is a multi-step process involving several enzymes, including cytochrome P450 aromatase. In chicken embryos, the aromatase gene (CYP19A1) is expressed female-specifically from the time of gonadal sex differentiation. To further explore the role of aromatase in sex determination, we ectopically delivered this enzyme using the retroviral vector RCASBP in ovo. Aromatase overexpression in male chicken embryos induced gonadal sex-reversal characterised by an enlargement of the left gonad and development of ovarian structures such as a thickened outer cortex and medulla with lacunae. In addition, the expression of key male gonad developmental genes (DMRT1, SOX9 and Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH)) was suppressed, and the distribution of germ cells in sex-reversed males followed the female pattern. The detection of SCP3 protein in late stage sex-reversed male embryonic gonads indicated that these genetically male germ cells had entered meiosis, a process that normally only occurs in female embryonic germ cells. This work shows for the first time that the addition of aromatase into a developing male embryo is sufficient to direct ovarian development, suggesting that male gonads have the complete capacity to develop as ovaries if provided with aromatase.Citation: Lambeth LS, Cummins DM, Doran TJ, Sinclair AH, Smith CA (2013) Overexpression of Aromatase Alone is Sufficient for Ovarian Development in Genetically Male Chicken Embryos.

Although the exact mechanism of avian sex determination is still unclear, genes on one or both of the sex chromosomes must initiate sexual differentiation of the embryonic gonads into testes or ovaries, and eventually all other sexually dimorphic features. In the chicken and in all other birds, a ZZ male: ZW female sex chromosome system exists. Two hypotheses have been proposed for the mechanism of avian sex determination. The W (female) chromosome may carry a dominant-acting ovary determinant, or alternatively the dosage of a Z-linked gene might be required for male development [2].Male and female chicken embryonic gonads are morphologically indistinguishable up until 6 days post-fertilisation (Hamburger-Hamilton stage 29–30). In ZZ males, bilateral testes develop, characterised by seminiferous cords (Sertoli cells together with prospermatogonia) that develop in the inner part of the gonad (the medulla). In ZW females, the left gonad rapidly grows into an ovary with a thickened outer cortex that is the site of folliculogenesis, while the right progressively regresses into a vestigial organ. In both the left and right gonads, cells of the medulla express the cytochrome P450 enzyme, aromatase (CYP19A1). Aromatase shows female-specific expression in early gonads from the time of gonadal sex differentiation [3]–[6], and along with several other enzymes, catalyses estrogen synthesis. In genetically female chicken embryos, estrogen is critical for normal ovarian development [7], [8] and is also important for secondary sexual characteristics, such as the generally cryptic colouration of female birds. At the same developmental stage that aromatase becomes active in female embryonic gonads, the conserved testis gene SOX9 becomes active in male gonads. SOX9 is expressed in the embryonic testis cords, where by analogy with other vertebrates, it is thought to trigger differentiation of the Sertoli cell lineage. These two factors, aromatase in female and SOX9 in male, are therefore considered to be of fundamental importance in establishing either an ovary or a testis in chicken embryos [5], [9], [10].The manipulation of estrogen levels in the early chicken embryo induces sex reversal. Injection of a single dose of an aromatase enzyme inhibitor at day 3.5 of development is sufficient to produce ZW female-to-male sex reversal, characterised by the formation bilateral testis that are capable of spermatogenesis and an external male-type phenotype [7]. However, although females treated with the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole developed testis-like gonads and masculine-type male genitalia at hatching, these birds showed no difference in body weights compared to untreated females and an increasing portion had normal ovarian follicles as they aged [11]. It has also been found that exposure to exogenous estrogen can transiently feminise genetically male embryos. Both gonads appear ovarian, but this effect is not permanent, with individuals reverting to a male phenotype within one year of hatching [12], [13]. Estrogen levels can also vary naturally. The henny feathering trait, whereby roosters have identical feathering to the hens, was originally described in the Sebright Bantam and was attributed to an inherited condition that resulted in increased extragonadal activity of aromatase [14], [15]. It was found that the aberrant aromatase expression in these animals was due an allelic mutation in the sequence directly flanking aromatase that resulted in the insertion of a retroviral derived promoter sequence [16], [17]. Taken together, these experiments highlight the critical importance of aromatase and estrogen in chicken ovarian development.Although aromatase expression in chickens is a hallmark of the female program of development, experimental overexpression of aromatase leading to a gonad phenotype has not been reported in this or any other vertebrate species. The current study aimed to test if overexpression of aromatase alone in male embryos could affect gonad development. We found that ectopic overexpression of this enzyme was sufficient to induce a male-to-female gonadal sex-reversal in genetic ZZ embryos, characterised by the development of the left gonad into ovarian tissue. This phenotype also included a disruption in the expression of key male genes including DMRT1 and SOX9, and upregulation of ovarian development genes FOXL2 and RSPO1. Furthermore, genetically male germ cells followed a female developmental pattern and were capable of undergoing meiosis. These data indicate that the overexpression of aromatase alone is sufficient for ovary development in genetically male chicken embryos.All experiments were carried out with respect for the principles of laboratory animal care and were consistent with the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes, 7TH Edition 2004 and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, Victoria 1986. This included official approval from the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute Animal Ethics Committee (AEC # A627).To assess the effects aromatase mis-expression in chicken embryos we used the avian retroviral vector RCASBP [18], [19]. To clone aromatase, RNA was extracted from a Hamburger-Hamilton stage 36 (HH36) ZW female chicken embryo using TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was then DNAse treated using the DNA-free™ kit (Ambion) and cDNA was synthesized using the First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche). The same sequence of the aromatase open reading frame that was previously cloned and tested in vitro [20] (Accession J04047) was PCR amplified from cDNA using forward primer 5′-ATACCAGAAACTTTGAATCCACTGA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATAGGATCCCCCTGTAATGTTAATGCTGATCC-3′ with an included BamHI site. The resultant 1544bp fragment was subcloned into the NcoI and BamHI sites of pSLAX-13. The aromatase sequence was then cloned into RCASBP/A proviral DNA on ClaI and its sequence confirmed by DNA sequencing. The viral DNA was then transfected into chicken fibroblastic DF1 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and propagated for approximately 2 weeks. Immunostaining of aromatase and the viral protein p27 at this stage confirmed infection and ectopic aromatase expression in vitro. Recombinant virus was harvested from culture medium, concentrated by ultracentrifugation and titered as previously described [21]. High titre virus (at least 10?8 Infectious Units/mL) was injected into day 0 blastoderms, and eggs were sealed with parafilm and incubated at 37.5°C for the indicated time points. Control embryos were either not injected, or injected with RCASBP/A virus carrying GFP (RCASBP-GFP). These experiments were repeated at least three times and involved at least 50 embryos for each experiment. Embryos were harvested at embryonic days 5.5 (HH28), 7.5 (HH32), 10.5 (HH36) or 18.5 (HH44). For the majority of experiments, E10.5 embryos were examined as at this time point male and female gonads are well differentiated, including a clear asymmetry and development of a thickened outer cortex in the left gonad in female, and the appearance of defined seminiferous cords in males. Immunostaining tissues with p27 antibody, which detects a viral epitope, confirmed RCASBP infection.Infected and control embryos were dissected at indicated time points. For genetic sexing of embryos, a small piece of limb tissue was digested in PCR compatible Proteinase K buffer and the genomic DNA was used for rapid PCR sexing [22]. By this method, only females show a W-linked (female-specific) XhoI band. Amplification of 18S rRNA in both sexes served as an internal control.Control and aromatase mis-expressing tissues were fixed for 15 minutes in 4% PFA/PBS at room temperature, prior to processing for tissue section immunofluorescence, as described previously [23]. At least three embryos per time point and/or treatment were examined. Briefly, 10 µm sections were cut on a cryostat, permeablised in PBS 1% Triton X-100 and blocked in PBS 2% BSA for 1 hour. Primary antibodies were either raised in-house (rabbit anti-chicken aromatase (1∶5000), rabbit anti-chicken DMRT1 (1∶5000), rabbit anti-chicken vasa homologue (CVH) (1∶6000), rabbit anti-chicken FOXL2 (1∶6000), rabbit anti-chicken R-Spondin1 (RSPO1) (1∶2000)), or were obtained commercially (rabbit anti-p27 (1∶1000); Charles River Services, goat anti-AMH (1∶1000); Santa Cruz, mouse anti-fibronectin (1∶500); Serotec, goat anti-GFP (1∶500); Rockland, rabbit anti-mouse SCP3 (1∶700); Novus Biologicals). Alexa-fluor secondary antibodies were used (donkey or goat anti-rabbit, mouse or goat 488 or 594; Molecular Probes). Sections were counterstained with DAPI.Histology tissues were fixed overnight in Bouin’s fluid (Sigma), dehydrated in a tissue processor, embedded in paraffin and cut on a microtome at 4 µm. Sections were then stained in haematoxylin and eosin prior to mounting and imaging (Biomedical Sciences Histology Facility, University of Melbourne).For the in ovo overexpression of aromatase, we developed an RCASBP retroviral vector encoding the open reading frame sequence for this gene. DF1 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA of the recombinant RCASBP-Aromatase vector and overexpression of aromatase protein was confirmed by immunostaining with an anti-aromatase antibody (data not shown). To test the activity of this virus in ovo, chicken blastoderms were injected with concentrated recombinant virus and at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5), embryos were dissected and gonads were analysed for aromatase expression by immunofluorescence (Figure 1). Staining of the left and right gonads of female controls indicated typical aromatase expression in the gonadal medulla, and as expected, no aromatase expression was detected in control male gonads. In male embryos infected with RCASBP-Aromatase, expression was evident in both the left and right gonads in an expression pattern that resembled that of a control female. Although this clearly demonstrated overexpression of aromatase in the male gonads, the level was somewhat lower than the control female. In female embryos infected with RCASBP-Aromatase, strong aromatase expression was observed at a similar level to the control female (Figure 1).RCASBP-Aromatase virus was injected into blastoderms and aromatase expression was assessed at embryonic day 10.5 by immunostaining (10×magnification). For each, the left (Lg) and right (Rg) gonads are shown with aromatase staining (green). No expression was detected in control males, while control females showed robust aromatase expression in the medulla. RCASBP-Aromatase infected embryos showed gonadal aromatase expression in both males and females.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068362.g001To test the effect of aromatase overexpression on chicken gonad development, we analysed the gonads of E10.5 embryos for morphological changes. The urogenital systems of male and female controls showed normal gonad morphology for embryos at this stage of development, as shown by wholemount brightfield microscopy (Figure 2A). In particular, control males had cylindrical gonads with no obvious asymmetry, whereas control females had typical asymmetry characterised by a well developed and enlarged left ovary and a smaller regressing right gonad. RCASBP-Aromatase infected genetic ZW female embryos also exhibited a normal female gonad appearance. Genetic male embryos infected with RCASBP-Aromatase showed varying degrees of asymmetry, evidenced by the enlargement of the left gonad, which in some cases, was comparable to that of the female controls (Figure 2A). As an additional control, we also injected embryos with the EGFP expressing virus RCASBP-GFP which, as expected [21], showed high level GFP expression in both gonads of males and females with each showing normal development characterised by asymmetrical female gonads only (Figure S1).The urogenital systems of control and RCASBP-Aromatase virus infected E10.5 embryos. (A) Wholemount brightfield imaging (4×magnification) shows the mesonephric kidneys (Ms), and the right gonad (Rg) and left gonad (Lg), which is delineated by the black dashed lines. Gonadal asymmetry by enlargement of the left gonad of the RCASBP-Aromatase infected male is evident. (B) Haematoxylin and eosin staining of the left gonads of control and RCASBP-Aromatase injected embryos. The cortex and medulla regions for each are indicated and arrows highlight selected germ cells. Control males have a minimal cortex and large medulla, and very few germ cells, whereas the control female, and the RCASBP-Aromatase infected female and male have a thickened outer cortex and large numbers of germ cells.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068362.g002The histology of E10.5 of aromatase overexpressing gonads was then analysed (Figure 2B). In control males, normal testicular morphology was evident, characterised by a thin outer cortex and well-developed seminiferous cords containing germ cells (arrows). In contrast, the control female left ovary had a thickened outer cortex with numerous germ cells. For the RCASBP-Aromatase infected embryos, the female showed normal gonad development whereas the left gonad of the male showed morphology that resembled a typical female structure. In particular, these males had a thickened outer cortex with a large number of germ cells (Figure 2B).To further analyse the effect of aromatase overexpression on male gonadal development, tissues were immunostained for both aromatase and the extracellular matrix glycoprotein fibronectin. In males, fibronectin delineates basement membrane and hence outlines testis cords, and in females it outlines medullary cords and delineates the fibronectin negative cords. No aromatase was present in left gonad of the control male, and fibronectin staining clearly outlined the structures of the highly organised seminiferous cords and cortex (Figure 3A). Strong aromatase expression was evident in the medulla of control female gonads with no expression in the cortex (Figure 3A). Fibronectin staining of the left gonads of RCASBP-Aromatase infected males revealed morphological features characteristic of female left gonads, such as a thickened outer cortex and disruption of the seminiferous cord structures of normal males. The overexpression of aromatase in these tissues also followed an expression pattern similar to that of the control female, i.e. localized to the medulla (Figure 3A). We also analysed the right gonads of both control and RCASBP-Aromatase infected males by immunostaining for aromatase and fibronectin. The control male right gonad had clearly defined seminiferous cords, whereas the female right gonad had a less organised medulla (Figure 3B). Despite lower levels of ectopic aromatase expression in the right gonad of an RCASBP-Aromatase infected male compared to the control female, the cord structures appeared to be somewhat disrupted and overall resembled the female structure.Gonads of control and RCASBP-Aromatase virus infected E10.5 embryos immunostained for aromatase (green) and fibronectin (red) (20×magnification). The medulla (m) and cortex (c) are indicated and boxed areas are shown adjacently as high power images. White dashed lines indicate medulla:cortex boundaries. (A) The left gonads of the control male and female show normal gonadal development. The male has a medulla with characteristic cord structures (arrows) and no aromatase expression. Females show strong aromatase expression and have a vacuolated medulla with lacunae (arrows) and a thickened outer cortex. The left gonad of an RCASBP-Aromatase infected male has strong aromatase expression and like the control female, features a thickened outer cortex, lacks cords in the medulla and contains lacunae (arrow). (B) The right gonads of a control males and females show normal gonad development. The right gonad of a male overexpressing aromatase shows lower aromatase expression compared to the control female, but appears to have disrupted formation of the testis cords.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068362.g003The analysis of E10.5 RCASBP-Aromatase infected embryos showed a clear male to female sex-reversal. To further explore this phenotype throughout embryonic development, a time course analysis of aromatase overexpression was carried out. We examined gonads from E5.5 (just prior to sex differentiation), E7.5 (just after the onset of differentiation), E10.5 (mid-stage gonad development), and E18.5 (late stage embryos with well differentiated gonads). The expression of aromatase and fibronectin was monitored in the left gonads of control males and females, and RCASBP-Aromatase infected males by immunostaining. The control males showed an absence of aromatase expression across all time points, and from E7.5 onwards, fibronectin revealed well-defined cord structures (Figure 4A). The control female gonads showed aromatase expression at all time points tested, and the outer cortex increasingly thickened from E7.5 onwards. The RCASBP-Aromatase infected male gonads also showed aromatase expression at all time points tested and followed a pattern of localisation that closely resembled the control female. The development of a thickened outer cortex that increased in size across the time points was also very similar to the control female, as was the appearance of lacunae from E10.5 (Figure 4A).The gonads of control and RCASBP-Aromatase infected embryos immunostained for aromatase (green), fibronectin (red) and DAPI (blue) as indicated. The medulla (m) and cortex (c) are indicated and boxed areas are shown adjacently as high power images. White dashed lines indicate medulla/cortex boundaries. (A) Time course analysis of E5.5, E7.5, E10.5 and E18.5 left gonads (Lg) of control males and females, and RCASBP-Aromatase infected males (20×magnification). The control male features characteristic seminiferous cord structures within the medulla from E7.5 onwards. The control female and the RCASBP-Aromatase infected male have a thickened outer cortex, which increases in size progressively across all time points, and both have vacuolated medullary spaces (arrows). (B) RCASBP-Aromatase infected genetic male with an ovotestis. Left panel: a left gonad that contains areas of low (i) and high (ii) aromatase expression (10×magnification). (i) Normal male development indicated by the formation of cord structures (arrows), (ii) typical female morphology indicated by the formation of a thickened outer cortex (arrows) and disruption of cord structures (20×magnification).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068362.g004Analysis of some immunostained RCASBP-Aromatase infected male gonads also showed that aromatase overexpression was in some cases variable throughout the gonad section. Inconsistent transgene expression from RCASBP is an observation that we have previously reported when using this vector for DMRT1 knockdown [24]. In the current study, areas of limited aromatase expression resulted in the formation of ovotesticular tissues (Figure 4B). In some individuals with partial feminization, the gonads tissues featured areas of normal male appearance with clearly defined cord structures, while others had localized thickening of the cortex, disruption of seminiferous cords, and the appearance of lacunae within the medulla. The appearance of these ovarian tissues correlated with the areas of higher aromatase expression.The expression of several key male-specific genes is required for testis development. To analyse the effect aromatase-induced sex reversal had on these genes, we monitored the expression of three key testis genes DMRT1, SOX9 and Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) by immunofluorescence on E10.5 gonads. Staining of the control males and females indicated normal expression levels and distribution of these proteins. For the males, strong expression was evident for DMRT1, SOX9 and AMH, and in each case this expression was confined to seminiferous cords (Figure 5). In contrast, very low level or no expression was evident in the females for each of these genes. In the RCASBP-Aromatase infected male gonads, the expression of all three of these genes was suppressed and showed expression patterns that were very similar to the female controls (Figure 5). In addition to the modulation of these key male genes in the left gonads, similar suppressive effects were also seen in the right gonads of sex reversed males (Figure S2). Taken together, these results showed that these three key testis development genes were not expressed in male gonads as a result of aromatase mis-expression, and their expression was indistinguishable from normal female gonads at this stage of development.Left gonads of control and RCASBP-Aromatase infected embryos were immunostained for DMRT1, SOX9 and AMH (green) (20×magnification). The medulla (m) and cortex (c) are indicated and white dashed lines show the medulla/cortex boundaries. Control males show strong expression throughout testis cords for each, whereas both the control females and the sex reversed aromatase overexpressing males have little to no expression of these genes.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068362.g005The expression patterns of ovarian development pathway genes FOXL2 and RSPO1 were then analysed by immunostaining left gonads. FOXL2 expression was monitored in E7.5 embryos as chicken gonads at this stage of development show robust female-specific expression [3], [25]. For this experiment, normal FOXL2 expression patterns were indicated by the male and female controls (Figure 6A). The female showed widespread nuclear expression throughout the cortex and medulla, whereas in the male no FOXL2 was detected. In RCASBP-Aromatase infected male and female E7.5 gonads, FOXL2 expression was similar to the control female. This included strong nuclear staining in both the cortex and medulla.Left gonads of control and RCASBP-Aromatase infected embryos were immunostained for FOXL2, RSPO1, CVH or SCP3 (green), and DAPI (blue) (20×magnification). The medulla (m) and cortex (c) are indicated and boxed areas are shown as high power images. White dashed lines indicate medulla/cortex boundaries. (A) E7.5 left gonads: FOXL2 expression in control and RCASBP-Aromatase infected females occurs throughout the gonad and is confined to the nucleus of positive cells. Background staining can be seen in the control male, whereas high levels of nuclear FOXL2 can been seen in the RCASBP-Aromatase infected male. E7.5 left gonads: RSPO1 expression in control and RCASBP-Aromatase infected females occurs throughout the gonad and is more intense in the cortex. Staining in the cords is evident in the control male, whereas the RCASBP-Aromatase infected male shows an expression pattern that is similar to the females. (B) E18.5 left gonads: The control male has CVH positive germ cells scattered throughout the medulla, whereas control female and the RCASBP-Aromatase male have only a few CVH positive germ cells in the medulla and large numbers localised within the outer cortex. No SCP3 positive cells are present in the control male. The female control and the RCASBP-Aromatase infected male have SCP3 positive germ cells in the outer cortex.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068362.g006The expression of RSPO1 in aromatase overexpressing gonads was then analysed in E10.5 embryos, as female gonads from E10.5–E12.5 show significantly higher levels of expression compared to males [26]. Immunostaining for RSPO1 showed that a high level of expression was seen in the control female, particularly in the cortex. The control male showed a very different expression pattern with staining in the cords. In the RCASBP-Aromatase infected female and male gonads, RSPO1 expression followed a similar level and pattern as the control female, with higher expression in the cortex (Figure 6A). Taken together, these data showed that both ovarian developmental genes FOXL2 and RSPO1 were upregulated in response to aromatase overexpression in male gonads.To analyse the localization and replicative states of the germ cells in aromatase-induced sex-reversed male gonads, the expression of the germ cell marker chicken vasa homologue (CVH) and the meiotic germ cell marker SCP3 were monitored. For CVH, the control male gonad showed a scattering of positive cells throughout the medulla, whereas the control female had fewer cells in the medulla and large numbers throughout the cortex (Figure 6). As in control females, the germ cells of the RCASBP-Aromatase infected male gonads were mostly found in the cortex. Next, we determined if these mis-localized male germ cells were capable of entering meiosis, a process that normally only occurs late-stage females germ cells during embryonic development [27]. Immunostaining for the meiosis marker SCP3 in control males and females showed female-specific expression in E18.5 gonads (Figure 6). Although fewer in number compared to the control female, SCP3 positive germ cells were present in the cortex of the aromatase over-expressing sex-reversed male gonads, indicating that these germ cells not only showed a female-like distribution, but were also capable of undergoing meiosis.This study shows that the over expression of a single steroidogenic enzyme, aromatase, is sufficient for female gonad development in genetically male embryos. The temporal and spatial expression patterns of the enzymes involved in steroidogenesis determine the ratio of androgens to estrogens in developing gonads [3]. Studies into the exact roles of these enzymes suggest that the lack of estrogen synthesis in males occurs due to the absence of both aromatase and 17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) [3]. These two enzymes are indispensable for the final steps of the steroidogenic pathway, responsible for the conversion of androgen substrates into active estrogens (estrone and 17β-estradiol) [28]. Although it has been shown experimentally that the direct manipulation of steroid hormone levels in chickens can cause sex-reversal [11]–[13], these effects are generally only transient. Nevertheless, these experiments highlight the fundamental role that estrogen and its production by aromatase play in females, however the effect of aromatase misexpression at the time of sexual differentiation was unknown.We developed viral vectors for aromatase overexpression in ovo using RCASBP, which upon injection into blastoderm stage embryos allow for embryo-wide infection and transgene expression from the viral LTR promoter [21]. Initial analysis of E10.5 gonads by immunofluorescence showed that male embryos, usually negative for aromatase, showed high levels of overexpression of this protein, albeit at slightly lower levels compared to control females. Although this overexpression in infected males did not match the levels in normal females, analysis of the phenotype of E10.5 gonads revealed ovarian development in these genetic males. This macroscopic change in gonad morphology was reflected by histological analysis of the aromatase-overexpressing males, which showed that the gonad had developed a thickened outer cortex, a phenotype that closely matched the structure of the female left gonad at the same age. We have observed previously that embryos infected with RCASBP show varying degrees of transgene expression [24], so it was not surprising that the RCASBP-Aromatase infected individuals showed a variety of levels of feminisation, indicated by varying degrees of left gonad asymmetry (Figure 2A).A deeper analysis of this sex reversal phenotype of aromatase overexpressing male gonads was provided by co-staining for fibronectin and aromatase, and by examining the gonads of embryos sampled at early, middle and late stages of development. These data showed that the extent of this sex reversal was sufficient to produce a morphology that was essentially identical to the normal female phenotype, and that this change occurred at the time of sex differentiation (E7.5) and was maintained in late-stage embryos just prior to hatching (E18.5). The retroviral method used here should deliver gene expression ubiquitously throughout the embryo, as we have seen for EGFP expression [21]. In the current study, we found that embryos infected with RCASBP-GFP virus showed strong EGFP expression throughout both male and female gonads, which in females included the cortex as well as the medulla (Figure S1). It was therefore interesting to find that overexpressed aromatase in males was limited to the parts of the gonad where it is normally expressed in females, and in females the levels of aromatase did not appear to be any higher than the female control. These findings suggest that a separate layer of control over both the location and level of aromatase expression may have been enforced. It was also found that the site of aromatase overexpression in gonad tissues was an important aspect of sex phenotype. In particular, variable or patchy localised aromatase expression produced an ovotestis phenotype (Figure 4B). In these gonads, the level of local estrogen production was sufficient to create regions with a thickened cortex and vacuolation of cords. These results highlighted the requirement for aromatase to be expressed throughout the gonad at sufficient or similar levels to the native expression seen in female gonads, and suggest that estrogen was acting locally.Our data also indicated that aromatase expression (and hence presumably estrogen synthesis) was sufficient to suppress the testis pathway (DMRT1, SOX9 and AMH). However, it is unclear whether one or all of these genes were affected directly. The effects are most likely mediated via antagonism with DMRT1, which is the first of these genes to be expressed in males and is required for testis determination. In addition to the testis pathway genes, analysis of ovarian implicated genes FOXL2 and RSPO1 showed that the female molecular pathways were also affected by aromatase overexpression. Since FOXL2 is predicted to be an activator of aromatase [29] and hence upstream in the pathway, the observation that its expression was elevated in sex reversed male gonads suggests that either this assumption is incorrect, or that a feedback mechanism exists that allows FOXL2 expression to be induced. RSPO1, which acts through a separate pathway involving WNT4 and β-catenin, is important in vertebrate ovarian development and is active in the developing chickens [26]. The effect of estrogen on RSPO1 expression has already been demonstrated by drug-mediated inhibition of aromatase, which caused its expression in female gonads to be suppressed [26]. The current study therefore supports these observations, as we saw RSPO1 expression increase in response to aromatase-mediated sex reversal. Overall, the modulation of these key male and female gonad development genes indicated that aromatase overexpression in genetic males caused gonad feminisation at the both structural and molecular levels.Aromatase mediated sex reversal also extended its effect to germ cells. The appearance of CVH positive cells in the cortex was in stark contrast to the expression pattern of germ cells in normal males, where they are characteristically far fewer in number and are scattered throughout the medulla. Furthermore, the finding that these mis-localised germ cells were positive for the meiotic marker SCP3 indicated that these sex-reversed genetic male gonads could potentially be reproductively viable as female gametes later in development. Indeed, it would be interesting to examine the effect of aromatase overexpression on hatched genetic male chickens to determine if the gonads are completely sex-reversed and able to develop into mature ovarian follicles capable of oocyte production, and if secondary sexual characteristics such as colouration would also be affected.The data presented here clearly showed that the addition of aromatase alone into genetic male embryos was sufficient for female gonad development. However, in addition to aromatase, the final conversion of steroid intermediates into active estrogens also involves the catalytic activity of 17β-HSD. The expression of chicken 17β-HSD has been detected in the developing left and right gonads of females, but not in males [6]. A chicken cDNA copy of a 17β-HSD sequence was cloned from female ovarian tissues, while its expression was not detected in equivalent male testis samples [30]. Although these and other studies show that males do not express 17β-HSD, these reports were focused on subtype 1 of this enzyme [6], [30], [31]. In mammals however, there have been up to fourteen 17β-HSD subtypes described so far [32]. Interestingly, 17β-HSD type-3 has been found to show testis-specific expression in mice [33] and abnormalities in its expression can lead to XY disorders of sexual development [34]. Although the chicken genome does not appear to encode any sequences that share any significant identity to human 17β-HSD type-3 (Human genome; Feb. 2009 GRCh37/hg19 assembly), recent data from our lab generated using RNA Sequencing on E4.5 gonads showed that chicken 17β-HSD type-4 was highly expressed males [35].These findings suggest that despite an absence of 17β-HSD type-1 in male gonads, other subtypes may be present that are able to convert steroid hormone intermediates into active estrogens. Alternatively, it is possible that the role of 17β-HSD in estrogen synthesis is dispensable and aromatase can alone act to convert sufficient estrogens for female development. This may involve estrogens other that 17β-estradiol. For example, estrone is produced through the action of aromatase alone, acting on androgenic substrates without involvement of 17β-HSD [36]. Although estrone is considered a weak estrogen, it could be produced at sufficient levels in males over-expressing aromatase to induce the ovarian development reported here. In any case, the current study suggests that in chicken embryos, it is aromatase and not 17β-HSD that is the limiting factor in the production of sufficient estrogens needed to direct female gonad development. It is however, entirely possible that the effect of aromatase overexpression is transient and that in adult birds 17β-HSD (and/or other factors) might be required for complete gonadal sex reversal and to reach levels of fertility that match those of a normal female.The basic mechanism of sex determination in chickens is likely to occur either through the action of dominant-acting female determinant carried on the W chromosome or by a Z-dosage mechanism (i.e. two copies for male development and one for female). The data presented here could support either modes of sex determination. Evidently, aromatase is an absolute requirement for female development and its addition alone in a male gonad is sufficient to override testis gene expression and drive ovarian development. Therefore, the factor that is leading to the eventual activation of aromatase could be a W-linked gene that is not expressed in male gonads. This gene could act directly or perhaps by inducing FOXL2, which is thought to activate aromatase [25], [37]. Alternatively, the dosage of a Z gene acting upstream of aromatase, such as DMRT1, has simply been overridden experimentally by the addition by this enzyme described here. It should be noted however, that a gonadal sex determination mechanism that relies upon an initial two-fold dosage system might be considered susceptible to perturbation, especially given the potency of aromatase.Although the importance of aromatase in maintaining female gonadal development has been well documented, this study shows that its overexpression in a genetically male chicken embryo can also affect gonad phenotype. The data presented here indicates that regardless of the status of 17β-HSD in male gonads, aromatase alone is sufficient to induce ovarian development and male-to-female sex-reversal in chicken embryos. This work therefore builds upon previous studies that have identified the fundamental role that aromatase plays in the female program of development and implies that all other factors required to produce a female gonadal phenotype are already present in genetic male embryos.RCASBP-EGFP expression in E10.5 gonads.

Learn about our remote access optionsMany reptiles, including the red‐eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta), possess a temperature‐dependent sex determination (TSD) mechanism where the temperature at which the developing embryos are incubated dictates the gonadal sex of the animal. A number of mammalian gene orthologues have been identified in the sex determination/differentiation cascade of reptiles with TSD although the exact trigger(s) is not well understood. A potential early regulator of gonadal differentiation, Lhx9, controls the proliferation of gonadal cells in mice and its absence prevents gonadal development and drastically reduces the expression of Sf‐1, a gene that regulates the expression of steroidogenic enzymes in the bipotential gonad. In the current study, we cloned Lhx9 from T. scripta and analyzed its expression throughout the thermosensitive period of gonad development using quantitative PCR. We examined the expression profiles of Lhx9 in embryos incubated under control conditions at male‐ and female‐producing temperatures and with the application of exogenous 17β‐estradiol or an aromatase inhibitor, Letrozole, to induce sex reversal. The T. scripta Lhx9 cDNA and predicted amino acid sequence showed high homology to those of chicken, anole, and mouse. Lhx9 was expressed at both male‐ and female‐producing temperatures with expression levels increasing throughout the thermosensitive period. Letrozole induced sex‐reversal did not alter Lhx9 expression levels. 17β‐estradiol treatments appeared to inhibit or delay gonadal differentiation and resulted in lower Lhx9 expression from the presumptive gonadal ridge region. The structural homology and temporal expression pattern of Lhx9 suggests that this represents a conserved element in the gonadal differentiation cascade of T. scripta. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev.

Although the mechanisms of avian sex determination remains unknown, the genetic sex is experimentally reversible by in ovo exposure to exogenous estrogens (ZZ-male feminization) or aromatase inhibitors (ZW-female masculinization). Expression of various testis- and ovary-specific marker genes during the normal and reversed gonadal sex differentiation in chicken embryos has been extensively studied, but the roles of sex-specific epigenetic marks in sex differentiation are unknown. In this study, we show that a 170-nt region in the promoter of CYP19A1/aromatase, a key gene required for ovarian estrogen biosynthesis and feminization of chicken embryonic gonads, contains highly quantitative, nucleotide base-level epigenetic marks that reflect phenotypic gonadal sex differentiation. We developed a protocol to feminize ZZ-male chicken embryonic gonads in a highly quantitative manner by direct injection of emulsified ethynylestradiol into yolk at various developmental stages. Taking advantage of this experimental sex reversal model, we show that the epigenetic sex marks in the CYP19A1/aromatase promoter involving DNA methylation and histone lysine methylation are feminized significantly but only partially in sex-converted gonads even when morphological and transcriptional marks of sex differentiation show complete feminization, being indistinguishable from gonads of normal ZW females. Our study suggests that the epigenetic sex of chicken embryonic gonads is more stable than the morphologically or transcriptionally characterized sex differentiation, suggesting the importance of the nucleotide base-level epigenetic sex in gonadal sex differentiation.Gonadal sex differentiation in vertebrates is a sequential and highly organized process. Mammalian sex is determined exclusively by genetic information conveyed by the X and Y sex chromosomes, whose homogametic combination (XX) makes females and heterogametic combination (XY) makes males. In contrast, in birds, heterogametic combination of their two sex chromosomes Z and W (ZW) is associated with females whereas homogametic combination (ZZ) is associated with males [1]. Different from mammals whose sex is strictly determined by their genotype, control of phenotypic gonadal sex differentiation in birds is reversible by exposure to exogenous hormonal agents, resembling the environmentally vulnerable sex differentiation of lower, ectothermic vertebrates such as reptiles or fish [2]. For example, in ovo exposure of ZZ-male chicken embryos to exogenous estrogens or estrogenic endocrine disruptors during their early stages of development causes male-to-female gonadal sex conversion [2–6]. Conversely, exposure of ZW females to aromatase inhibitors such as fadrozole causes complete and permanent gonadal and total-body sex conversion to males [7–10], demonstrating the critical importance of P450-aromatase (AROM) activity in female sex differentiation [1, 2, 11].Although the genetic sex of chicken is determined at fertilization, sex-determining genes are activated later during embryonic development, inducing testis or ovary from the bipotential, undifferentiated primordial gonad formed from the intermediate mesodermal tissue on the ventromedial surface of the embryonic mesonephroi [2]. By Day 3.5 of the 21-day in ovo development, the primordial gonads consist of an outer epithelial layer (the cortex) and the internal medulla containing cords of somatic cells and loose mesenchymal cells. The onset of gonadal sex differentiation becomes morphologically evident at Day 6.0–6.5. In ZZ-male gonads, the medullary cords thicken and incorporate germ cells to form seminiferous cords while the cortex shrinks. In contrast, in ZW females, the entire right gonad shrinks and the cords of the medulla in the left gonad become vacuolated to form lacunae, whereas somatic and germ cells in the cortex proliferate in the left gonad [2].In mammals, biosynthesis of sex steroids is initiated in gonads after completion of their sex differentiation, and the process of gonadal sex differentiation itself is essentially resistant to exogenous sex steroids or their inhibitors [1, 2]. In contrast, estrogen synthesis is observed in still undifferentiated primordial gonads of ZW-female chicken embryos at the time of initiation of morphological gonadal sex differentiation, which itself is highly susceptible to hormonal manipulation. The two critical enzymes required for the terminal steps of estrogen biosynthesis—namely, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17βHSD) and AROM—are expressed only in the medullary cords of the ZW-female gonads immediately before the onset of morphological gonadal differentiation (Day 6.0–6.5) [1, 2, 12–14]. Because other enzymes involved in the upstream steps of sex steroid biosynthesis are expressed in the gonadal medulla of both sexes [14], 17βHSD and AROM are the only components showing sexual dimorphism in the estrogen biosynthesis pathway. Estrogen receptor α is expressed in the gonadal cortex of both sexes prior to sex differentiation, and its expression in male gonads and the right (i.e., shrinking) female gonads is later suppressed [2, 13, 15]. It is well accepted that estrogens synthesized in the medulla of female gonads mediate ovarian gonadal differentiation by supporting development of the gonadal cortex through the activation of estrogen receptor α and that transient expression of estrogen receptor α in undifferentiated ZZ-male embryonic gonads is responsible for sex reversal by exogenous estrogens [2]. Expression of the forkhead transcription factor FOXL2 is temporospatially similar to expression of 17βHSD and AROM in ZW-female chicken embryonic gonads, and it has been proposed that FOXL2 may be an important upstream regulator of genes encoding these estrogen-synthesizing enzymes [10, 16, 17].Recent studies revealed critical roles of the Z chromosome-linked DMRT1 gene and the chicken male hypermethylated region (cMHM) located adjacent to the DMRT1 locus on the Z chromosome in male sex determination of chicken embryonic gonads [2, 18–20]. It has been proposed that the cMHM is hypermethylated to transcriptionally inactive status in male primordial gonads and that noncoding RNA transcripts expressed exclusively from the cMHM of female primordial gonads suppress expression of DMRT1, currently the best candidate master masculinizing gene of chicken gonads. Thus, mechanisms regulating DMRT1 expression by cMHM suggest the importance of epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the process of gonadal sex differentiation in chicken embryos [2, 19, 21]. However, little information is presently available on epigenetic marks of other, autosomal key genes involved in chicken gonadal sex determination.In the present study, we identified highly quantitative, phenotypic sex-dependent changes in nucleotide-level epigenetic marks located within a 170-nt region of the promoter of CYP19A1 gene, which is on the autosomal chromosome 10 and encodes AROM. We also show that these epigenetic sex marks are partially feminized in gonads of ZZ males sex-converted by in ovo exposure to a synthetic estrogen. Interestingly, the epigenetic sex marks still significantly retained a partially masculine profile even in strongly feminized gonads whose morphological and transcriptional markers of sex differentiation are indistinguishable from those of normal ZW-female gonads. Our study provides the first example of highly quantitative, nucleotide base-level epigenetic marks in a promoter of key autosomal gene involved in sex differentiation of chicken embryonic gonads and suggests that the epigenetic sex of gonads may be more resistant to environmentally induced sex reversal than transcriptional or morphological marks of gonadal sex differentiation.All the animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Fertile research-grade SPF eggs of White Leghorn chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories and incubated under 70%–80% humidity at 37.8°C with intermittent rotations (90°C at every 30 min around the horizontally laid long axis of eggs) in a research-grade avian egg incubator. Eggs were candled on Day 3.0 (the day initiating incubation is Day 1), and dead eggs were removed from the experiments before further processing. Greater than 95% of eggs alive on Day 3.0 hatched on Day 21 of incubation.For genetic sex typing, 10 μl venous blood samples were collected from Day 17 embryos and subjected to quantitation of Z and W sex chromosomes by TaqMan qPCR as we previously described [22]. Embryos were dissected on Day 19, and the sex-specific gross morphological characteristics of their gonads (as reviewed in [1, 2]) were scored as shown in Figure 1A. For histological examinations, Day 19 gonadal tissues were fixed with formalin and subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining following a standard protocol. Genomic DNA and total RNA were simultaneously isolated from embryonic gonadal tissues using the AllPrep kit (QIAGEN). The right and left testes of each embryo showed no significant histological differences and were pooled for epigenomic and transcriptomal analyses.Feminization of ZZ-male chicken embryonic gonads by exposure to EE2 during early stages of development. A) Quantifying the degrees of feminization by gross morphology of Day 19 embryonic gonads. Photographs in the top row show frontal images of ZZ-male embryonic gonads in the retroperitoneal space (bar = 1 mm). Gonads and mesonephric kidneys are identified in the bottom row. Criteria for feminization scoring are shown in the table. B) Quantitative gonadal feminization of EE2-exposed ZZ-male gonads depends on the timing of exposure initiation. EE2 exposure (20 μg/egg) was initiated at the indicated time (x-axis), and its feminization effect was scored (y-axis). Normal morphological differentiation of ZZ testes is observed between Days 6.0 and 7.0 (shown by blue shade). Each datum point indicates mean ± SEM of averaged feminization scores determined for five different batches of experiments consisting of at least five ZZ-male eggs.ZZ-male chicken embryos were feminized by injecting emulsion consisting of ethynylestradiol (EE2), peanut oil, lecithin, and water directly into yolk as previously described for experimental sex conversion of Japanese quail embryos [23]. Each egg was injected with 50 μl emulsion containing 20 μg EE2 (>98% purity; Spectrum Chemicals) or the same volume of emulsion without EE2 (vehicle control). Upon injection, the oil emulsion containing EE2 immediately surrounded the developing embryos located at the top of yolk because of its buoyancy, ensuring immediate exposure of the embryos to EE2. Emulsion injection into yolk with or without EE2 did not affect viability or overall development of chicken embryos except for sexual differentiation. By our hands, injection of EE2 into albumin or air cell with ethanol, dimethylsulfoxide, or olive oil vehicle resulted in poor reproducibility of experimental feminization, probably because of certain physical unevenness in exposure of embryos to EE2 [24].Day 19 gonads collected and pooled from 20–40 genotyped embryos were minced by scalpels on ice, digested with trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid at 37°C for 30 min, and passed through cell strainers (40 μm pore size). Single cell suspensions were stained with mouse anti-SSEA-1 (stage-specific embryonic antigen 1) monoclonal antibody (MC-480-c, immunoglobulin M (IgM)-κ light chain; University of Iowa Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) and then further stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated, F (ab′)2 fragment goat anti-mouse IgM μ-chain antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). FITC-stained, SSEA-1 positive germline cells were removed from gonadal somatic cells by the magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) anti-FITC MicroBeads kit (Miltenyi Biotec). The three-antibody germline cell capture scheme is shown in the supplemental data available online at www.biolreprod.org (see Supplementary Fig. S3A). Two consecutive runs of MACS magnetic purification procedures achieved approximately 70%–80% purity for germline cells and greater than 99.9% purity for gonadal somatic cells, which were confirmed by fluorescence microscopy as shown in the supplemental data (see Supplementary Fig. S3B). Similar MACS-based systems for separating germline cells from gonadal somatic cells have been performed in previous studies for chicken [25–27] and mouse [28]. In our present study, we focus on the germline-depleted somatic cell preparations because of the significant impurity of the MACS-isolated germline cells.Technical details of Affymetrix microarray and reverse transcription TaqMan qPCR were described in our previous studies [29–31]. Expression of individual mRNA transcripts for gonadal sex marker genes was determined by reverse transcription qPCR TaqMan assays (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan assay identifications (IDs) were as follows: Gg03815934_s1 (ACTB), Gg03346129_g1 (CYP17A1), Gg03366975_m1 (ESR1), Gg03346002_m1 (CYP19A1), and Gg03341744_s1 (FOXL2). Expression of mRNA transcripts for DNA methyltransferases was determined by QuantiTect reverse transcription CYBR Green qPCR assays (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer's protocol. QuantiTect assay IDs were as follows: Gg_GAPDH_1_SG (GAPDH), Gg_DNMT1_1_SG (DNMT1), Gg_DNMT3A_1_SG (DNMT3A), and Gg_DNMT3B_2_SG (DNMT3B).Purified genomic DNA samples were subjected to bisulfite conversion of unmethylated cytosines to uracils using EZ DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research). Promoter sequences of CYP19A1 and ESR1 (identified by boxes in Fig. 4A) were amplified by PCR from bisulfite-converted DNA and subjected to pyrosequencing determination of relative cytosine methylation. Primers for PCR amplification and sequencing are provided as Supplementary Table S1. DNA methylation in the first exon of DNMT3A and DNMT3B genes was determined by pyrosequencing as previously described [32]. Pyrosequencing reactions and data collection were performed by PyroMark Q96 MD system (QIAGEN).Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays of chicken embryonic gonads were performed as described in our previous study [33] using the ChIP-IT Express Enzymatic Kit (Active Motif) with modifications. Day 19 gonad(s) isolated from a single embryo was washed with PBS and subjected to crosslinking in 1% formaldehyde freshly diluted in PBS at room temperature for 20 min. Tissue was then washed with PBS and soaked in the crosslinking stop buffer containing a high concentration of glycine provided in the kit at room temperature for 5 min. The fixed tissue was then homogenized in the kit's cell scraping solution on ice using a plastic pestle and a sample cup, and the homogenate was subjected to chromatin isolation, enzymatic fragmentation of chromatin, and immunoprecipitation following the kit's instructions. Immunoprecipitation of the chromatin fragments was performed overnight at 4°C using protein G-conjugated magnetic beads provided in the kit with antibodies to trimethylated H3 histone lysine 4 (H3K4me3), trimethylated H3 histone lysine 27 (H3K27me3), and both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (39159, 39156, and 39097, respectively; Active Motif). Magnet-precipitated chromatin was extensively washed, and its DNA-protein crosslinking was reversed by heating at 95°C for 15 min. Chromatin fragments recovered in the supernatant of the heating step were subjected to proteinase K digestion, and a DNA sequence overlapping the differentially methylated CpG sites in chicken CYP19A1 promoter (as indicated in Fig. 7A) was amplified by PCR using Platinum PCR supermix (Invitrogen) and the following primers: forward, 5′-ACTGCTGCTCCTTTCAGCAT; reverse, 5′-AGGAAGCTTTTTGTTGGGCT. The 223-nt PCR product was visualized by the FlashGel gel electrophoresis system (Lonza) and quantitated using the ImageJ64 image-processing software (National Institutes of Health).Differences in averages were tested by Student t-test (unpaired, two-tail). Heteroscedastic data with significant F-test results (P < 0.05) were tested by the Welch t-test (unpaired, two-tail).Chicken embryos were exposed to a fixed dose of EE2 (20 μg/egg) emulsified in an oil mixture partly mimicking yolk components [23] and injected directly into yolk at various times during early development. The buoyancy of the emulsion ensured immediate exposure of the embryos to the EE2, which was confirmed by rapid distribution of fluorescein isothiocyanate dye in the entire embryonic tissues observed within minutes after injection (data not shown). Figure 1A shows gross appearance and scoring criteria of morphological feminization applied to normal and feminized ZZ-male gonads observed on Day 19. Exposure of ZZ-male embryos to EE2 initiated on Day 3.0–4.0 resulted in 100% morphological feminization of gonads (i.e., gross appearance of the feminized ZZ gonads was indistinguishable from that of normal ZW-female ovaries) whereas exposure initiated on Day 9.0 had no detectable effects (Fig. 1B). Complete morphological sex reversal of the EE2-exposed ZZ-male gonads was further confirmed by histological examinations, which revealed characteristics of ovarian differentiation, including strong mesenchymal vacuolization and highly thickened cortex containing germ cells [2] (Fig. 2). Delaying initiation of EE2 exposure from Day 4.0 gradually diminished the degree of feminization of ZZ-male gonads. Injection of vehicle emulsion without EE2 never affected morphological gonadal sex (data not shown). These observations indicate that ZZ-male gonads are sensitive to EE2-induced sex reversal only before completion of the morphological gonadal sex differentiation occurring on Days 6.0–7.0, which is indicated by the blue shade in Figure 1B [2].Histological characteristics of chicken embryonic gonads at Day 19 of incubation using H&E staining. Bar indicates 0.5 mm (low-power panels) and 50 μm (high-power panels), respectively. Blue arrows in the high-power panels indicate germline cells.Microarray profiling of normal gonadal transcriptomes on Day 19 showed extremely strong expression of the mRNA transcripts for CYP19A1/AROM and FOXL2 in ovaries compared to testes (Fig. 3A). Expression of the mRNA transcripts for SOX9, a key transcription factor required for testicular sex differentiation [2], was stronger in ZZ testes than in ZW ovaries. Expression of several other mRNA transcripts involved in gonadal sex differentiation (reviewed in [1, 2]) differed by no greater than 2-fold between ZZ testes and ZW ovaries on Day 19.Messenger RNA expression profiling of chicken embryonic gonads.

Orange curve and the right y-axis indicate degrees of morphological feminization shown in Figure 1B. Yellow band indicates the timing of gross morphological differentiation of normal testes (Day 6.0–7.0). Each datum point indicates mRNA expression relative to expression in testes of vehicle-exposed ZZ-male embryos (mean ± SEM of five or more independent gonads). Messenger RNA expression in vehicle-exposed ZW-female ovaries is also shown. *P < 0.05 compared to vehicle-exposed ZZ-male testes (t-test).The EE2-induced, complete morphological feminization of ZZ-male gonads was associated with strong expression of the mRNA transcripts for both CYP19A1/AROM and FOXL2 to the levels indistinguishable from those in vehicle-injected ZW-female ovaries (Fig. 3B). Expression of these ovarian marker genes was completely suppressed to the levels in vehicle-injected ZZ-male testes when EE2 injection failed to induce morphological feminization because of delayed initiation of exposure. Expression of ESR1 (encoding estrogen receptor α) in ZZ gonads was also enhanced to the normal ovarian level by the EE2-induced feminization although its sex-dependent difference was not as robust as CYP19A1/AROM or FOXL2. Expression of CYP17A1 (encoding 17α-hydroxylase, a P450 enzyme required for androgen synthesis) was not affected by feminization.To examine whether EE2-induced expression of CYP19A1/AROM mRNA in the feminized ZZ-male gonads is associated with changes in epigenetic marks on its promoter, methylation of CpG dinucleotides in CYP19A1 promoter was determined by bisulfite pyrosequencing. The promoter of ESR1, whose expression was only modestly stronger in ZW ovaries compared to ZZ testes, was also included in the analysis. Figure 4A indicates positions of CpG dinucleotides in the CYP19A1 and ESR1 promoters around their transcription initiation sites (TISs). To our surprise, a 1-kbp region around the TIS of CYP19A1 contained no CpG dinucleotide (shown by horizontal bar). For this reason, 10 CpG sites most proximal upstream to the TIS were subjected to methylation analysis (boxed). For ESR1, methylation of 16 CpG sites in a DNA segment that included the TIS (boxed) was determined.DNA methylation profiling of chicken embryonic gonads.

Dot and bar indicates mean ± SEM; numbers of individual embryos involved in each plot are indicated in parentheses. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01 compared to gonads of vehicle-exposed ZZ-male embryos (t-test).Among the 10 CpG sites in the CYP19A1 promoter, the most distal five sites located 1400–1900 nt upstream to the TIS were strongly methylated (>60% methylation), showing no significant differences between ZZ testes, ZW ovaries, and completely sex-reversed ZZ gonads (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the CpG site 869 nt upstream to the TIS, CpG(−869), showed strongly sex-dependent differential methylation, namely, greater than 45% methylation in ZZ testes, 30%–35% methylation in completely sex-reversed ZZ gonads (feminization score = 3/3, or 100%), and less than 20% in ZW ovaries. The remaining four CpG sites were moderately methylated (>40%) with smaller degrees of sex-dependent differences. Bisulfite pyrosequencing of the same gDNA samples for CpG dinucleotides around the ESR1 TIS revealed their strong hypomethylation without significant sex-dependent differences (Fig. 4C), demonstrating the specific nature of the sex-dependent hypomethylation of CpG (−869) in the CYP19A1 promoter.The sex-dependent differential methylation at and around CpG (−869) of the CYP19A1 promoter in chicken embryonic gonads was further confirmed by independently performed experiments involving larger numbers of embryos (Fig. 4D). Thus, CpG (−869) was hypermethylated in vehicle-injected ZZ testes (51.3% ± 0.8%; mean ± SEM, n = 20), hypomethylated in vehicle-injected ZW ovaries (21.3% ± 0.8%; n = 24), and methylated to an intermediate extent in completely sex-reversed ZZ-male gonads (34.0% ± 2.4%; n = 18). Importantly, whereas these sex-reversed gonads were indistinguishable from vehicle-injected ZW ovaries by morphological and transcriptional criteria (see Figs. 1–3), the DNA methylation marks of CpG dinucleotides 955, 869, and 789 nt upstream of the TIS of the CYP19A1 promoter never reached the degrees of hypomethylation observed with vehicle-injected ZW ovaries. In contrast, degrees of CpG (−869) methylation in heart muscle (left ventricle) were exactly the same between ZZ males and ZW females, showing slight hypomethylation compared to vehicle-injected ZZ testes (43%–45%) (Fig. 4D). The absence of the phenotypic sex-dependent differential methylation of CpG (−869) in the CYP19A1 promoter was also observed in the liver (data not shown). Thus, DNA methylation at CpG (−955), CpG (−869), and CpG (−789) of the CYP19A1 promoter reflected phenotypic gonadal sex differentiation in Day 19 chicken embryo whereas the same epigenetic marks showed no sex-dependent difference in other tissues than gonads.To further characterize the EE2-induced CYP19A1 promoter hypomethylation, we determined methylation at CpG (−869) and the two adjacent CpG sites of CYP19A1 promoter in partially feminized ZZ gonads on Day 19 (Fig. 5). Methylation at these CpG sites was indistinguishable from that of vehicle-injected ZZ testes when EE2 exposure was delayed, initiating on Day 7 or later. Earlier initiation of exposure to EE2 caused hypomethylation of all three CpG sites although CpG (−869) was far more robustly hypomethylated than the other two CpG sites. Reproducing the results shown in Figure 4, B and D, hypomethylation of these three CpG sites was significant in the sex-reversed ZZ gonads but did not reach the very low levels of DNA methylation observed in the vehicle-injected ZW ovaries. Taken together, these results confirmed that the CYP19A1 promoter is hypomethylated at specific CpG sites when ZZ gonads are sex-reversed by exposure to EE2 prior to completion of morphological sex differentiation whereas the maximum degrees of such EE2-induced hypomethylation do not reach to the levels of DNA hypomethylation observed in genetically female ZW ovaries.DNA methylation at CpG (−955), CpG (−869), and CpG (−789) of the CYP19A1 promoter in Day 19 gonads of ZZ-male chicken embryos exposed to EE2 (20 μg/egg) from the indicated days of incubation. Orange curve and the right y-axis indicate degrees of morphological feminization shown in Figure 1B. Each datum point indicates DNA methylation at CpG sites 955, 869, or 789 nt upstream of the CYP19A1 TIS (mean ± SEM of five or more independent gonads). CpG methylation in vehicle-exposed ZZ-male testes and ZW-female ovaries are also shown. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01 compared to vehicle-exposed ZZ-male testes (t-test).To obtain further insights into the mechanism of the sex-specific differential DNA methylation observed in the CYP19A1 promoter, we examined mRNA expression and DNA methylation status of the DNMT family of genes encoding the DNA methyltransferases. Expression of the mRNA transcripts for the DNMT1 maintenance DNA methyltransferase and the DNMT3A and DNMT3B de novo DNA methyltransferases were not significantly affected by either the genetic sex or EE2-induced sex conversion (Supplementary Figure S1). Therefore, the sex-dependent differential methylation in the CYP19A1 promoter was not explained by changes in the DNMT mRNA expression. We next determined DNA methylation status in the first exon of the de novo DNA methyltransferase genes using the pyrosequencing assay described by Yu et al. [32]. As shown in Supplementary Figure S2, neither DNMT3A nor DNMT3B genes showed significant sex-dependent differences in their first exon methylation. Note that the DNMT3B data presented here do not contain polymorphic CpG dinucleotides whose cytosine is often substituted with adenine or guanine as previously described [32] and confirmed by our experiments (data not shown). The absence of sex-dependent differential DNA methylation in these genes further supports the highly specific nature of the sex-dependent epigenetic markers in the CYP19A1 promoter.The chicken gonadal tissue consists of two distinct types of cells, namely, germline cells and somatic cells. When chicken primordial germ cells (PGCs) are conveyed from the epiblast into the genital ridge through the bloodstream, both ZZ PGCs and ZW PGCs are still sexually bipotential and capable of differentiating into both male and female germline lineages [2]. When gonadal somatic cells undergo sex differentiation, the phenotypic sex of the PGCs is determined by the sex of the somatic cells surrounding them [2]. Therefore, EE2-induced feminization of ZZ-male gonads is presumed to occur primarily in the gonadal somatic cells. We considered the possibility that the incomplete epigenetic sex conversion of the CYP19A1 promoter observed with the whole-gonadal tissue samples (Figs. 4 and 5) might be explained if gonadal somatic cells could actually undergo complete epigenetic sex conversion whereas germline cells do not. To address this possibility, SSEA-1 positive germline cells were depleted from single cell suspensions of Day 19 chicken embryonic gonads by a MACS system using a monoclonal antibody to SSEA-1, a glycoprotein marker antigen specifically expressed in germline cells in mammalian and chicken embryonic gonads [34] (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Two consecutive MACS runs yielded germline-free gonadal somatic cells showing less than 0.1% of contamination of SSEA-1 positive, fluorescent cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Germline-enriched cells showed contamination of up to 30% fluorescence-negative cells.DNA methylation profiles of the ESR1 promoter were clearly different between the germline-enriched cells and the germline-depleted somatic cells (Supplementary Fig. S3C). The strong CpG methylation immediately before the TIS in the germline-enriched cells may reflect the absence of germline expression of estrogen receptor α [2]. The similarity in the ESR1 promoter methylation in the germline-depleted somatic cells and the whole gonads (Supplementary Fig. S3C, center panel; compare with Fig. 4C) suggests the dominance of somatic cells compared to germline cells in Day 19 gonads. In contrast, the CYP19A1 promoter methylation profiles determined using the same genomic DNA samples were similar between the germline-enriched cells and the germline-depleted somatic cells (Supplementary Figure S3D). Detailed methylation analyses on CpG (−869) and the adjacent two CpG sites in the CYP19A1 promoter demonstrated significant but moderate hypomethylation of CpG (−869) in the germline-depleted somatic cells isolated from completely feminized ZZ-male gonads exposed to EE2 from Day 3 (Fig. 6A), reproducing the observations made with the whole gonadal tissues (see Figs. 4 and 5). These results indicate that the difference in the degree of the CYP19A1 promoter hypomethylation between the completely feminized ZZ gonads by exposure to EE2 and the gonads of vehicle-injected ZW-female embryos directly reflected the epigenetic status in the gonadal somatic cells with negligible bias derived from the germline cells. The EE2-induced expression of the mRNA transcripts for CYP19A1/AROM and FOXL2 observed with the whole-gonadal tissue specimens (Figs. 4 and 5) was reproduced with the germline-depleted somatic cells (Fig. 6B), indicating that both the EE2-induced hypomethylation of the CYP19A1 promoter and the concomitant, robust expression of these two marker genes of ovarian differentiation were derived from changes in the gonadal somatic cells. Because of the significant contamination of the gonadal somatic cells in the SSEA-1 positive germline-enriched cell preparations, their transcriptional and DNA methylation analyses were inconclusive (data not shown).DNA methylation and mRNA expression in Day 19 germline-depleted gonadal cells in chicken embryos. A) DNA methylation at CpG sites 955, 869, or 789 nucleotides upstream of the CYP19A1 TIS in germline-depleted gonadal somatic cells. Embryos were exposed to EE2 (20 μg/egg) or vehicle from Day 3. Data indicate CpG methylation on Day 19 (mean ± SEM of five or more independent gonads). *P < 0.05 (t-test). B) Expression of mRNA transcripts for CYP19A1/aromatase and FOXL2 in germline-depleted gonadal somatic cells of chicken embryos exposed to EE2 (20 μg/egg) or vehicle from Day 3. Messenger RNA expression in total testes and ovaries of control animals is also shown. Data indicate relative mRNA expression compared to that in Day 19 total testes of vehicle-exposed ZZ males and are presented in log scale (mean ± SEM of five or more independent gonads).To obtain insights into whether the EE2-induced DNA hypomethylation in the CYP19A1 promoter in ZZ-male gonads is mechanistically linked to the concomitant and strong expression of the CYP19A1/AROM mRNA transcripts, histone modifications (protranscriptional H3K4me3 and antitranscriptional H3K27me3) and RNA polymerase II recruitment to CYP19A1 promoter in Day 19 chicken embryonic gonads were examined by ChIP assay. To our surprise, extensive analyses around the ovary-specific TIS of the CYP19A1 promoter as reported by Matsumine et al. [35] detected neither sexual dimorphism in the H3K4me3/H3K27me3 ratio nor RNA polymerase II recruitment (data not shown). Interestingly, however, ChIP assays targeting a promoter sequence involving the three sex-dependent, differentially methylated CpG sites (Fig. 7A) did show sex-dependent changes in the H3K4me3/H3K27me3 ratio and phenotypic feminization-dependent recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Fig. 7, B and C). In ZZ-male gonads, H3 histones in this region were predominantly methylated at the antitranscriptional lysine-27, and no RNA polymerase II recruitment was detected. In contrast, in ZW-female gonads, H3 histones in the same region were predominantly methylated at the protranscriptional lysine-4, and recruitment of RNA polymerase II was readily detected. In the EE2-exposed, feminized ZZ gonads, histone H3 was methylated at both lysine-4 and lysine-27 with comparable strength, and significant recruitment of RNA polymerase II was also detected. Thus, not only DNA methylation but also histone H3 modifications at this specific region in the CYP19A1 promoter demonstrated significant but incompletely feminized profiles. These results suggest that the sexually dimorphic epigenetic marks of this region in the CYP19A1 promoter may play mechanistic roles in the strong expression of the CYP19A1/AROM mRNA transcripts characteristic to the phenotypically female chicken embryonic gonads.Pro- and antitranscriptional histone modifications and RNA polymerase II recruitment to the CYP19A1 promoter in Day 19 chicken embryonic gonads.

The masculinizing gene DMRT1 and the ovarian marker genes ASW and FET1 already show genetic sex-dependent differential mRNA expression in gonads on Day 3.5 when ZZ gonads and ZW gonads are still morphologically indistinguishable [1, 2]. In the present study, we observed morphologically and transcriptionally complete male-to-female gonadal sex reversal in chicken embryos exposed to EE2 no later than Day 4.0 (Figs. 1 and 3). When EE2 exposure is initiated immediately before the gonadal morphological sex differentiation on Day 6.0, morphological feminization was slightly suppressed when it was evaluated using our arbitrary scoring system (Fig. 1) whereas mRNA expression of the key ovarian genes CYP19A1/AROM and FOXL2 was completely feminized (Fig. 3). A dramatic gain of resistance to the EE2-induced feminization of ZZ gonads occurred within a narrow window between Days 6.0 and 7.0 in both morphological and mRNA expression criteria. This timing matches initiation of normal expression of SOX9, a SOX family transcription factor well conserved among reptiles, birds, and mammals, and expressed exclusively in the Sertoli cell lineage of the medullary cords of male gonads [36]. The Sertoli cell is the first cell type to differentiate in male gonads that sets a cascade of cellular events resulting in testes differentiation [37]. Thus, EE2-induced morphological and transcriptional feminization of ZZ gonads is capable of overcoming effects of the early expression of the masculinizing genes DMRT1 (Day ∼3.5) and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH, Day ∼5.0) [2], but cannot reverse the masculinizing cascade once SOX9 initiates Sertoli cell differentiation.Whereas exposure of ZZ gonads to EE2 from as early as Day 3.0 resulted in complete morphological and transcriptional feminization observed with Day 19 gonads, the epigenetic sex marks in the promoter of the CYP19A1 gonadal feminizing gene was clearly incomplete, showing an intermediate level of DNA methylation and histone lysine methylation between the normal ZZ gonads and the normal ZW gonads (Figs. 4 and 5). Taken together, these observations suggest that, even when the exogenous EE2 triggered a feminizing cascade of molecular events through a shortcut activation of estrogen receptor α in the gonadal cortex [2] and suppressed progression of the genetically dictated masculinizing cascade as long as SOX9 expression was not initiated yet, the early events of gonadal masculinization initiated by DMRT1 may still affect the epigenetic mechanisms regulating expression of CYP19A1/AROM, leaving the persistent, intermediate epigenetic sex marks in its promoter. Previous studies observed that estrogen-induced gonadal feminization of ZZ-male chicken embryos often diminishes after hatching and during puberty of the birds [3]. The incomplete aspect of the epigenetic sex reversal in the CYP19A1 promoter (and probably other persistent, promasculinizing epigenetic marks regulating expression of other key sex-determining genes as well) may explain the unstable nature of the estrogen-induced feminization of ZZ gonads.Our pyrosequencing analyses on EE2-induced hypomethylation in the CYP19A1 promoter with nucleotide-base resolution power revealed that significant phenotypic sex-dependent differences in DNA methylation were restricted to less than six CpG dinucleotides within a 1.2-kb sequence (Fig. 4B). The most informative three CpG sites, −955, −869, and −789 nt upstream of the TIS (Figs. 4, B and D, and 5), were located within only a 170-nt segment flanked with hypermethylated segments. Furthermore, the phenotypic sex-dependent differences in methylation of these CpG sites were not dichotomous (i.e., zero methylation versus total methylation) but only quantitative although they were significant and highly reproducible (Fig. 4D). These features of the epigenetic sex marks identified in the present study may explain our multiple but unsuccessful attempts to detect phenotypic sex-dependent differences in DNA methylation by the microarray analysis of methylated DNA immunoprecipitation approach (data not shown), whose power to distinguish methylation status of a specific CpG dinucleotide is strongly affected by methylation of the surrounding DNA segments [38]. Our results were similar to those reported by Dolinoy et al. [39, 40], who determined changes in methylation of only nine CpG dinucleotides in the agouti pseudoexon 1A promoter of Avy/a mice induced by fetal exposure to estrogenic endocrine disruptors, demonstrating distinct sensitivities of the individual CpG sites for estrogen-induced methylation. Epigenetic effects of embryonic exposure to environmental agents in the vertebrate genomes might be sometimes restricted to small numbers of specific CpG sites rather than affecting relatively large numbers of CpG sites within long genomic DNA segments. Recent progress in research on the environmental endocrine disruptors, including EE2 as one of the strongest estrogenic environmental pollutants, has developed a paradigm that embryonic or fetal exposure of vertebrates to certain types of environmental endocrine disruptors may cause persistent changes in the epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression in the embryonic/fetal genome [39, 41–43]. Interestingly, an increasing number of studies propose that epigenetic changes introduced into the genome of germline cells by environmental epimutagens might be transgenerationally transmitted and cause disorders in the unexposed generations of the offspring [44–47]. Debates are ongoing as to whether such transgenerationally transmitted, disease-relevant epimutations may require specific genetic backgrounds of the laboratory animals [48] or might not occur as significant threats to human and wildlife health with environmentally relevant concentrations of the epimutagens chemicals [49]. Our present study demonstrates the importance of examining changes in DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks caused by fetal exposure to environmental factors with the single nucleotide resolution power using the latest high-throughput technologies, including base-specific cleavage mass spectrometry [47, 50] and bisulfite deep sequencing [51–53] in addition to the standard bisulfite pyrosequencing approach. Future studies should address the mechanistic basis of this apparent nucleotide-level specificity of epigenetic effects of embryonic exposure to environmental hormonal agents. Establishing comprehensive methods of nucleotide-resolution epigenetic analysis would also be important to determine whether multigenerational effects observed after exposure of vertebrate embryos/fetuses to environmental factors are epigenetically transmitted [44–47] or occur through alternative mechanisms as recently reported [54, 55].Chicken embryonic gonads at Day 19 consist of multiple types of heterogeneous cells. Although our present study demonstrated that the aspects of epigenetic sex determined with the whole gonadal tissue samples were not significantly affected by depletion of the SSEA1-positive germline cells from the analysis (Fig. 6), the somatic cell population itself is still heterogeneous, consisting of cells in the cortex, the medullary cords, and the medullary stroma. Because histological observations did not find any significant differences between the EE2-feminized ZZ gonads and the control ZW gonads (Fig. 2), we presume that the quantitative differences in the epigenetic sex marks of the CYP19A1 promoter between these gonads were not primarily due to different ratios of the heterogeneous cell types. However, it remains to be determined by future studies as to whether such heterogeneous subpopulations of the gonadal somatic cells share a single pattern of common epigenetic sex marks or not.The discrepancy between the curves for AROM mRNA expression (Fig. 3B) and DNA methylation of the epigenetic sex marks in its promoter (Fig. 5) plotted using the same abscissa (initiation of EE2 exposure) may suggest that moderate hypomethylation of this promoter may be sufficient to release it from epigenetic transcriptional suppression. On the other hand, it is tempting to speculate that the EE2-feminized ZZ gonads might be more sensitive to endogenous and exogenous factors that repress transcription of the CYP19A1/AROM gene than normal ZW gonads because of the significantly more methylated status of this promoter. In this context, it is interesting that we were unable to detect RNA polymerase II recruitment to the previously reported TIS of the CYP19A1 promoter whereas we did detect it about 1-kb upstream to the TIS (Fig. 7 and data not shown). The ovarian TIS of chicken CYP19A1 promoter (nucleotide position 6,293,986 of NCBI Reference Sequence NW_003763854.1, Gallus gallus 4.0 whole genome shotgun sequence) was determined by Matsumine et al. [35] using a primer extension method, which was not designed to detect possibly another TIS 1-kb upstream of their RNA hybridization primer. Unfortunately, because the longest mRNA transcript for chicken CYP19A1/AROM registered in the publicly available databases starts at nucleotide position 6,293,942 of the same contig, which is even 44 nucleotides shorter than the transcript reported by Matsumine et al. [35], whether a true TIS of this gene locates near the CpG sites about 1-kb upstream of the previously reported TIS is left undetermined. Our multiple attempts to determine such a novel TIS by primer extension and other approaches have not been successful, possibly reflecting a short length of the first exon that is experimentally challenging to determine. The apparent discrepancy between our present study and the report of Matsumine et al. [35] might reflect possible differences in the transcriptional activity of the CYP19A1 gene in the embryonic chicken gonads and the ovaries of matured female chickens.At present, a mechanistic explanation about how exposure to EE2 results in highly specific changes in the epigenetic status of the CYP19A1 promoter is unavailable although previous studies suggests roles of estrogen receptor α in the mechanism of male-to-female sex reversal by exogenous estrogens [2]. Estrogen-dependent DNA demethylation in vertebrate cells has been known for over three decades. Estrogen-dependent demethylation of chicken vitellogenin promoter in the egg-laying hen is known to occur after its transcriptional activation by ligand-activated estrogen receptor without requiring DNA synthesis [56–58]. In human cells, the estrogen-responsive promoter of the pS2 gene undergoes rapid and cyclic changes in DNA methylation that are synchronized with cyclic recruitment of ligand-activated estrogen receptor α and RNA polymerase II [59, 60]. In the estrogen-dependent human MCF-7 breast cancer cells, activation of the cathepsin D gene is associated with rapid demethylation of its distal enhancer, which contains the estrogen responsive element and is known as a direct target of the estrogen receptors [61]. These studies suggest that estrogen might control DNA methylation through estrogen receptor-mediated events of transcriptional activation, which involves formation of a number of multiprotein complexes that could contain subunits that affect cytosine methylation of the targeted chromatin segments. The phenotypic sex-dependent DNA methylation marks in the CYP19A1 promoter described in the present study could also be explained in the context of estrogen-induced demethylation of the regulatory elements of transcriptionally active genes.Recently, proposed possible roles of the TET-family methylcytosine hydroxylases and the hydroxymethylcytosines in active and sequence-specific DNA demethylation [62] might also be relevant to the EE2-induced epigenetic changes, which should be addressed by future studies. Bannister et al. [63] recently reported that chicken micro-RNA MIR202*, which shows sexually dimorphic expression in embryonic chicken gonads (testis-specific) and reduces its expression upon estradiol-induced feminization of ZZ gonads [64], enhances expression of testis-associated genes DMRT1 and SOX9 and suppresses ovary-associated genes FOXL2 and CYP19A1/AROM [64]. It would be important to establish how different types of epigenetic mechanisms—namely, DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation, histone modifications, and micro-RNA—regulate expression of key sex determination genes in coordinating manners.In summary, our present study demonstrated that changes in DNA methylation associating phenotypic sex differentiation of chicken embryonic gonads can occur within a very short length of chromatin segment that may contain only a few CpG dinucleotides. Such changes in DNA methylation occur in a highly quantitative manner and are appropriately evaluated with the bisulfite-pyrosequencing technology. The morphological, transcriptomal, genetic, and epigenetic sex may not agree with each other when gonadal sex differentiation is disturbed by exogenous factors; the phenotypic sex (i.e., morphological and transcriptomal sex marks) can be completely reversed whereas epigenetic sex marks tend to be persistent with the original, genetically dictated sex. These findings provide critical insights into roles of the epigenetic mechanisms of normal gonadal development and their disruption by exogenous factors, emphasizing the importance of evaluating epigenetic events in a highly quantitative manner with nucleotide base-level resolution for the assessment of environmental toxicants as developmental epimutagens.We thank Crystal Mahoney, Sabrina Collins, and Shannon Smith for their technical assistance.Google ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarSupported by the NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) Federal Share/Program Income Grant (R7963) and the Friends of Mels grant to T.S.These authors contributed equally to this study.Current address: Department of Molecular Biology, Cell Biology and Biochemistry, Brown University.Oxford University Press is a department of the University of Oxford.

Sex reversal from genetic females into phenotypic males was induced by injection of 1.0 mg fadrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, into fertilized eggs at 3.0 days of incubation. Birds aged 30 weeks were classified into 4 groups according to the histological structure of their gonads and the natural logarithm of the ratio of testosterone to estradiol in serum, namely standard females, slightly sex-reversed females with left ovotestes, highly sex-reversed females with left testes, and standard males. The results showed that methylation of the cMHM amplicon was lowest in the ovaries of standard females and highest in testes of standard males. Methylation levels were significantly higher in the left testes of highly sex-reversed females than in the left ovotestes of slightly sex-reversed females (p < 0.05). Expression analysis of 9 sex-specific genes in the gonad indicated that DMRT1 and HINTZ had a similar expression pattern, with significantly higher levels in standard males as compared to standard females, slightly and highly sex-reversed females (p < 0.05). Expression of FOXL2, AMH, P450arom, SF1, and ERα was obviously higher in standard females than in standard males, slightly and highly sex-reversed females (p < 0.05). Expression of SOX9 in standard females was similar to that in slightly sex-reversed females and lower than in highly sex-reversed females and standard males (p < 0.05).© 2011 S.

Karger AG, BaselTissue-specific patterns of microRNA (miRNA) expression contribute to organogenesis during embryonic development. Using the embryonic chicken gonads as a model for vertebrate gonadogenesis, we previously reported that miRNAs are expressed in a sexually dimorphic manner during gonadal sex differentiation. Being male biased, we hypothesised that up-regulation of microRNA 202* (MIR202*) is characteristic of testicular differentiation. To address this hypothesis, we used estrogen modulation to induce gonadal sex reversal in embryonic chicken gonads and analyzed changes in MIR202* expression. In ovo injection of estradiol-17beta at Embryonic Day 4.5 (E4.5) caused feminization of male gonads at E9.5 and reduced MIR202* expression to female levels. Female gonads treated at E3.5 with an aromatase inhibitor, which blocks estrogen synthesis, were masculinized by E9.5, and MIR202* expression was increased. Reduced MIR202* expression correlated with reduced expression of the testis-associated genes DMRT1 and SOX9, and up-regulation of ovary-associated genes FOXL2 and CYP19A1 (aromatase). Increased MIR202* expression correlated with down-regulation of FOXL2 and aromatase and up-regulation of DMRT1 and SOX9. These results confirm that up-regulation of MIR202* coincides with testicular differentiation in embryonic chicken gonads.In vertebrate embryos, the gonads intitally develop as bipotential organs before undergoing sexual differentiation (testes in males, ovaries in females). Therefore, gonadal sex differentiation provides an ideal model for studying the genetic regulation of organogenesis. In the chicken (Gallus domesticus), the embryonic gonads differentiate into either bilateral testes in males or an asymmetric left ovary in females [1]. Sexual dimorphism in chicken embryonic gonads is first evident histologically at Embryonic Day 6.5 (E6.5) of the 21-day incubation period. From this time, seminiferous (testis) cords containing Sertoli cells and primordial germ cells (PGCs) form in male gonads. In females, the left gonad develops into a functional ovary, with a thickened outer cortex that contains PGCs, while the underlying medulla undergoes vacuolation. The right female gonad fails to proliferate a cortex and undergoes regression [1].The direction of gonadal sex differentiation in higher vertebrates (birds and mammals), is determined by the the inheritance of sex chromosomes. In mammals (female: XX; male: XY), the sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene acts as the primary testis-determining factor [2]. The Z and W sex chromosomes of birds (male: ZZ; female: ZW) are are not homologous to the mammalian X and Y, and SRY is absent. Instead, the conserved Z-linked gene, double-sex and mab-3-related transcription factor 1 (DMRT1), acts as a major regulator of testicular development via a dosage mechanism [3]. In the chicken, DMRT1 expression is higher in male (ZZ) gonads [4, 5] and knockdown of DMRT1 in ovo, disrupts expression of the testis-associated gene SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 9 (SOX9), and up-regulates the ovary-associated genes, Forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) and cytochrome P450, family 19, subfamily A, polypeptide 1, (CYP19A1; herein referred to as aromatase) [3]. However, the regulatory mechanisms that coordinate these testicular and ovarian-determining pathways in the chicken are poorly understood.The female sex hormone estrogen (estradiol-17β; herein abbreviated as E2) is required for ovarian differentiation in the chicken embryo [6, 7]. Genes encoding the steroidogenic enzymes aromatase and hydroxysteroid (17-beta) dehydrogenase 1 (HSD17B1) are expressed in the embryonic gonads in a female-specific manner from E6.0 on [8–10]. These enzymes are required specifically for estrogen biosynthesis in the developing ovary [11]. Inhibiting the activity of aromatase is sufficient to cause female-to-male gonadal sex reversal [6, 7, 12, 13]. Conversely, treatment of male embryos with exogenous estrogen prior to the onset of gonadal differentiation is able to feminize development of the male left gonad, resulting ovary, or ovo-testis formation [8, 14, 15].Aside from protein-coding genes and steroid hormones, microRNAs may also be involved in regulating embryonic testis versus ovary development [16, 17]. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (18–24 nt) noncoding RNAs that act as negative regulators of gene expression [18, 19]. They play important roles in a variety of developmental processes in animals [20]. In the reproductive system, miRNAs may be involved in regulating spermatogenesis [21, 22]. Conditional knockout of the key Dicer enzyme in mouse gonads also highlights a requirement for miRNAs in maintaining Sertoli cell functions [23, 24] and cell survival [25] during neonatal and postnatal testis development. Endogenous miRNA profiles differ between postnatal testes and ovaries in mice [26–28]. These findings suggest that miRNAs may be involved in regulating postnatal testicular and ovarian functions.We have previously shown that miRNAs are expressed in a sexually dimorphic manner in embryonic chicken gonads at three developmental stages spanning sexual differentiation [16]. More recently, Takada et al. have also demonstrated sexually dimorphic miRNA expression at 13.5 days postcoitum (dpc) in embryonic mouse gonads [29]. Their findings indicate that mouse MIR29B (or mmu-miR-29b) may promote the development of female primordial germ cells (PGCs) by down-regulating the expression of the DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b [29]. Further, Huang and colleagues have characterized a novel chicken miRNA, MIR363, that it is expressed in a female-biased manner at E6.5 in embryonic chicken gonads [30]. Together, these findings suggest that miRNAs are likely to be involved in regulating the embryonic gonadal sex differentiation. In our previous study, we showed that MIR202* expression is male biased during testicular development in embryonic chicken gonads [16]. This indicated that MIR202* may play a role in regulating embryonic testis development.To extend our previous studies, we sought to confirm that up-regulation of MIR202* is specifically associated with testicular differentiation using an experimental model. Modulating estrogen levels in the embryonic chicken gonads prior to the onset of sexual differentiation is known to induce gonadal sex reversal [6, 9, 12–15, 31, 32]. Therefore, we used estrogen modulation to feminize male (ZZ) gonads and masculinize female (ZW) gonads in order to study the association between male-biased MIR202* expression and gonadal sex differentiation. Changes in MIR202* expression were analyzed in E9.5 control gonads versus male and female gonads treated with either estrogen (estradiol-17β, or E2) or an aromatase inhibitor (AI; Fadrozole) that blocks estrogen synthesis. The results confirmed that up-regulation of MIR202* expression specifically coincides with testicular differentiation in the chicken embryo.All experiments involving chicken embryos in ovo were carried out in accordance with the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes (7th ed., 2004) and according to institutional animal ethics guidelines (Murdoch Childrens Research Institute and CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory). Eggs from commercial chicken lines were sourced from Bartter Enterprises Pty Limited (Ross 308) and research poultry farm (Rhode Island Red/Australop cross). Eggs were incubated at 38°C. Gonads or urogenital systems (UGS, gonads, and mesonephric kidneys) were dissected from chicken embryos at E9.5 in Petri dishes (BD Falcon) containing diethylpyrocarbonate-treated PBS. For immunofluorescence or whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH), UGS tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS (PFA/PBS; Merck). Gonads taken for RNA were separated from embryonic kidneys, immediately frozen in 0.5 ml RNase-free tubes (Ambion) on dry ice, and stored at −80°C during sexing.All in ovo injections were performed under sterile conditions using autoclave-sterilized instruments and sterile single-use 26G1/2 needles and 1-cc/ml tuberculin syringes (Terumo Medical Corporation). The injection time points represent stages of bipotential gonadal development and were chosen on the basis of existing protcols [6–8, 12, 14, 15, 32]. Injections were made directly into the albumen at the pointed end of the egg. Estradiol-17β (herein refered to as E2; catalog no. E1024; Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared at 1-mg/ml concentration in sterile 95% ethanol/ PBS. A single dose of 0.1 ml E2 in 100 μl was administered per egg at E4.5. Fadrozole (Novartis) was used as the AI. Stock solution was prepared at 10-mg/ml concentration in sterile PBS. A single dose of 1 mg AI in 100 μl was administered per egg at E3.5. Controls were injected with 100 μl of either 95% ethanol/PBS for estradiol for E2 experiments or 100 μl of PBS for AI experiments. Injected eggs were heat sealed with Parafilm M (Pechiney Plastic Packaging) and reincubated at 38°C until E9.5.All embryos were sexed at E9.5 macroscopically, by gonad morphology, and by sexing PCR. For macroscopic sexing, females were distinguished by asymmetric development of a large, flattened left ovary and visibly smaller right gonad, while males were distinguished by the presence of cylindrical, symmetrical gonads, as described previously [1]. For the sexing PCR, a piece of leg tissue from each embryo was collected in 30 μl of PCR digestion [16]. Sexing PCR was carried out using the primers and methods described by Clinton et al. [33]. Reactions were prepared in final volume of 20 μl, using GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCRs were run in a Mastercycler S thermal cycler (Eppendorf). Products were run on 1.5% 1× Tris-Borate EDTA (TBE) or Tris-Acetate EDTA (TAE) agarose gels.Urogenital systems were dissected from E9.5 embryos and fixed at room temperature for 15–20 min in 4% PFA/PBS at room temperature, then in 30% sucrose/PBS at 4°C overnight. Immunofluorescence was performed as described previously [3]. Briefly, tissues were frozen in TissueTek O.C.T (Sakura) on dry ice/ethanol slurry and stored at −80°C. Serial sections were cut at 5 μm on a cryostat (−17°C; Leica Microsystems) and rehydrated in PBS. Sections were then treated with 1% Triton X-100 (Merck) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, then blocked in 5% BSA/PBS for at least 30 min. Primary antibody solution comprised 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100. Primary antibodies used were rabbit-anti-chicken aromatase IgG (1:6000), rabbit-anti-chicken vasa homolog (CVH) IgG (1:6000), rabbit-anti-chicken DMRT1 IgG (1:6000) [3, 32], and mouse-anti-chicken fibronectin 1 (FN1) (1:1500; Serotec). Secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa fluor dyes (Invitrogen)—donkey-anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa488 (1:1000) and donkey-anti-mouse IgG-Alexa594 (1:1000) [3]—were then hybridized at room temperature for 1 h in 1% BSA/PBS. Sections were washed and treated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min in MilliQ-water and mounted for imaging using aqueous fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO). Images were captured at 200× magnification using a Leica DMLB fluorescence microscope and a DC300F camera (Leica Microsystems).WISH analysis for MIR202* expression in E9.5 chick embryonic urogenital systems (UGS) was performed using LNA probes at 46°C hybridization temperature, as described previously [16] (see also the section “Primers and Probes” below for details of LNA probes). Between 2 and 6 UGS were analyzed for each sex per experiment. Experiments were repeated for WISH analysis at least twice. Results were analyzed after overnight development of WISH staining in NBT/BCIP color reagents. Images of whole-mount gonads were captured using a Leica MZ16F stereomicroscope fitted with DFC290 color camera (Leica Microsystems) and Photoshop CS2 Software (Adobe).All RNA extractions were carried out using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Glycogen (10 μg; Invitrogen) was added to the aqueous phase, and 80% ethanol was used for the wash step to enhance precipitation of small RNAs. Gonads frozen at −80°C were thawed in Trizol and pooled for RNA extraction according to sex. Generally, gonads were pooled in groups of two to three gonad pairs for RNA extraction (left and right together). RNA pellets were resuspended in 10–20 μl of nuclease-free water (NFwater; Promega). Where necessary, RNA sample volumes were concentrated using vacuum centrifugation (SpeedVac; Thermo-Scientific). Prior to reverse transcription, RNA samples were treated with RQ1 DNase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA and cDNA concentrations were determined using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo-Scientific). All RNA samples were stored at −80°C.Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for sex-marker gene expression was performed using cDNA reverse transcribed from 1 μg of total RNA using random hexamers and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System Supermix; Invitrogen). Roche Universal Probe Library (UPL) and LightCycler480 system (Roche Applied Science) were used for quantitative analysis. Reaction mixes contained 1 μl cDNA at 1:5 dilution, 0.1 μl of UPL probe (Roche Applied Science), 3 μl of 1-μM primer mix (left and right), and 5 μl of LC480 2× Master Mix (Roche Applied Science). Cycle settings for LC480 were 94°C, 10 min; 45 cycles of 94°C, 10 sec; 60°C, 10 sec; and 72°C, 10 sec. Relative expression was calculated by the delta-delta Ct method using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation). Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT) was used as a reference control gene. Changes in gene expression were analyzed statistically by the Student t-test using Prism5 software (GraphPad Software Inc.).Analysis of MIR202* expression was carried out using the qRT-PCR polyadenylation method [34]. Polyadenylation reactions contained 1 μg of total RNA (8 μl), 0.25 μl (150 U) of Yeast Poly(A) Polymerase (PAP; catalog no. 74225; USB Corporation), 4 μl 5× PAP buffer and 1 μl of 10-nM rATP (Stratagene) and NF water (Promega) in a final volume of 20 μl. Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 30 min and then 95°C for 5 min and stored at −20°C. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using Superscript III (Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis Supermix; Invitrogen). Annealing reactions contained 4 μl of polyadenylated total RNA, 3 μl of modified oligo-dT primer (miR-PTA [34]) at 25 mM, and 1 μl of annealing buffer mix, incubated at 65°C for 5 min and cooled on ice. First-strand cDNA synthesis reactions were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions for oligo-dT-primed RNA. Complementary DNA samples were stored at −20°C. All PAP and cDNA synthesis incubations were carried out in a thermal cycler (MasterCycler S; Eppendorf).Quantitative analysis was performed using StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Machine and Software; Applied Biosystems), with universal reverse primer PAM-URP to recognize miR-PTA sequence and control or MIR202*-specific forward primers. Chicken U6 small-nuclear RNA (U6) was used as the reference control. Reaction mixes contained 2 μl cDNA diluted 1:50 in NFwater, 10 μl SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.8 μl of each primer (final concentration 200nM), and NFwater to 20-μl final volume. All samples were analyzed in triplicate in 96-well MicroAmp PCR plates (Applied Biosystems). Cycle settings were 94°C, 10 min; 94°C, 15 sec; and 60°C, 1 min (40 cycles). Melt curve was 95°C, 15 sec; 60°C, 1 min; ramp 0.3°C/sec; 95°C, 15 sec (one cycle). The delta-delta Ct method [35] was used for relative expression analysis. Melt curve analysis was performed for all reactions using StepOnePlus software (v2.0; Applied Biosystems) with default settings. Single-product amplification was verified by gel electrophoresis of end-point products, using 1.5% TAE Agarose gels. Statistical comparisons of MIR202* expression from qRT-PCR were conducted using the Student t-test (Prism5; GraphPad Software Inc.).All primers, unless otherwise stated, were obtained from Geneworks. The miR-PTA primer was synthesized with HPLC purification, and all other primers synthesized using standard PCR-grade, desalted purification. Primers used for sex-marker gene qRT-PCR were FOXL2 left 5′-GACACACACAGACGGACTGG-3′, right 5′-GCGGACGTCCTTCTCTCC-3′; DMRT1 left 5′-GCGGTTCTCCATCCCTTT-3′, right 5′-AGCCTCCCAGCAACATACAT-3′; SOX9 left 5′-TTCTCGCTCTCATTCAGCAG-3′, right 5′-GTACCCGCATCTGCACAAC-3′; CYP19A1 (aromatase) left 5′-CCTCTGCTGGAGATGGTTTT-3′, right 5′-GCTGATCCACTTTAGTCACTCTGA-3′; and HPRT left 5′-CAACTGTGCTTTCATGCTTTG-3′, right 5′-CGCCCTCGACTACAATGAATA-3′ (Sigma Proligo). UPL probes used for sex-marker gene qRT-PCR were FOXL2 #24; DMRT1 #59; SOX9 #61; CYP19A1 (aromatase) #165; and HPRT #38 (Roche Applied Science). Sequences of primers used for miRNA qRT-PCR were miR-PTA 5′-GAGGCGAGCACAGAATTAATACGACTCCATATAGGTTTTTTTTTTTTVN-3′, PAM-URP 5′-GAGGCGAGCACAGAATTAATACGAC-3′, MIR202* 5′-GCGCTTTCCTATGCATATACTTC-3′, MIR107 5′-GCAGCAGCATTGTACAGGGCT-3′, and U6 snRNA 5′-CCCTGCGCAAGGATGACACGC-3′. MIR202* Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA) probes used for WISH were obtained unlabeled from Sigma-Proligo and Exiqon (miRCURY LNA 5′-DIG labeled; catalog no. 37110-01). LNA probe sequences were Sigma-MIR202* 5′-AAgAAgTAtATgCAtAGgAAa-3′ (Tm = 65°C; LNA bases are indicated in lowercase) and miRCURY-MIR202* 5′-AAAGAAGTATATGCATAGGAAA-3′ (Tm = 68°C; LNA base composition not provided). LNAs and primers were stored at −20°C.Sigma and miRCURY LNA probes were 3′-labeled with 3′ digoxigenin (DIG) in 100 pmol aliquots, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche DIG Oligonucleotide 3′-End Labeling Kit, 2nd generation, Roche Applied Sciences; see also Banister et al. [16]). Probes were labeled 1 day before hybridization, stored at −20°C, and thawed on ice immediately prior to use. Equal amounts of 3′-DIG-labeled Sigma and miRCURY LNA probes were mixed for use in WISH hybridization (both probes can detect MIR202* at the same hybridization temperature, but the miRCURY probe has higher sensitivity because of double DIG labeling). A mixture of probes was used given the number of tissues to analyze by WISH and because limited amounts of miRCURY probe were available.According to our previous studies, MIR202* is expressed in a male-biased manner at E6.5 and E9.5 in embryonic chicken gonads. Therefore, MIR202* may be involved in regulating testicular development [16]. To understand whether this sexually dimorphic expression is due to MIR202* up-regulation in male gonads or to down-regulation in female gonads, we first quantified MIR202* expression changes during sexual differentiation using qRT-PCR. MIR202* expression was analyzed using qRT-PCR in male and female gonads at E5.5, E6.5, and E9.5 (Fig. 1). At E5.5 and E6.5, MIR202* expression was not significantly different between male and female gonads but was significantly higher in male versus female gonads at E9.5 (Fig. 1, P < 0.001). Comparing between stages, MIR202* expression increased in both sexes between E5.5 and E6.5 (Fig. 1). Between E6.5 and E9.5, MIR202* expression was specifically increased in male gonads. In the chicken, E6.5 represents the onset of morphological sexual differentiation. Therefore, these results confirmed the previous finding that up-regulation of MIR202* occurs specifically in male gonads from the onset of testicular differentiation.Expression of MIR202* in male and female embryonic gonads. Mature MIR202* expression was quantified using qRT-PCR in male (black) and female (white) gonads at E5.5 (n = 3), E6.5 (n = 3), and E9.5 (n = 4). All samples were analyzed in triplicate. MIR202* expression was normalized to U6 reference control and calculated as a fold difference relative to male E5.5 (1). Error bars show standard deviation (SD). Asterisks indicate statistical significance: **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Samples with different letters above the bars have statistically different expression levels.Having confirmed the MIR202* expression profile, we next sought to demonstrate that up-regulation of MIR202* was associated with the onset of testicular differentiation in an experimental model. We hypothesised that MIR202* expression should be up-regulated when testicular differentiation is induced and down-regulated when testicular differentiation is inhibited.To address this, in ovo estrogen modulation was used to induce gonadal sex reversal in male and female embryonic gonads. To disrupt testis development and induce feminization of male gonads, embryos were treated with estradiol-17β (E2) at E4.5. To disrupt ovary development and induce masculinization of female gonads, embryos were treated at E3.5 with Fadrozole, a chemical AI that blocks endogenous estrogen synthesis. The effects on MIR202* expression were then examined at E9.5.To confirm that testis and ovary development were successfully disrupted by estrogen modulation, gonadal morphology and histology were compared between gonads from control and E2- or AI-treated embryos at E9.5 (Fig. 2). The E9.5 time point was chosen for analysis, as MIR202* expression levels and testicular and ovarian morphology are normally distinct at this stage [16]. Control male gonads displayed normal bilateral testis development at E9.5 (Fig. 2A, ZZ). Testes appeared symmetrical in size and cylindrical in shape and tapered in diameter at the anterior and posterior ends. Left and right male gonads made up a single layer of cortical epithelium surrounding medullary testis cords. Testis cords were distinguished by a lack of fibronectin staining and localization of PGCs expressing the germ cell marker CVH (official gene name: DEAD [Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp] box polypeptide 4, or DDX4; Fig. 2A, i). DMRT1-expressing Sertoli cells were also present in the testis cords (Fig. 2A, iii). In line with existing reports [8, 10, 36], the estrogen-synthesizing enzyme aromatase was not expressed in control male gonads (Fig. 2A, ii). Control female gonads displayed normal asymmetric ovary development at E9.5, where the left gonad was larger and flatter in appearance than the right gonad (Fig. 2A, ZW). Ovarian cortex development was evident in the left ovary of control female embryos, characterized by the presence of CVH-positive PGCs (Fig. 2A, iv). Low levels of DMRT1 expression were also detected in the ovary (Fig. 2A, vi). Aromatase was expressed in the medulla of female gonads (Fig. 2A, v).Morphology and expression of gonadal sex markers in E9.5 gonads following estrogen modulation. A) Urogenital morphology and marker expression in control male (ZZ) and female (ZW) gonads. In males, PGCs express CVH and localize to testis cords (i), which also contain Sertoli cells expressing DMRT1 (iii). Aromatase is not expressed in male gonads (ii). Female left gonads have asymmetric ovary development and express aromatase in the medulla (v, m), and germs cells localize in the outer ovarian cortex (iv, c). DMRT1 is expressed at a low level in female gonads (vi). B) Urogenital morphology and marker expression in E2-treated male (ZZ) and female (ZW) gonads. Male E2-treated gonads show feminization of left gonadal cortex, and aromatase expression is induced. C) Urogenital morphology and marker expression in AI-treated male (ZZ) and female (ZW) gonads. Results shown for controls are representative of both control treatments (95% ethanol for E2 experiments and PBS for AI experiments). Green fluorescence indicates expression of sex markers: CVH (i,iv), aromatase (CYP19A1, ii,v), and DMRT1 (iii,vi). Red fluorescence shows fibronectin, which marks the extracellular matrix. In whole-mount urogenital systems, gonads are outlined in black; R = right gonad; L = left gonad. Marker expression is shown for left gonads only. White broken lines separate cortex (c) and medulla (m). Scale bars: whole mount = 1 mm (×2.5 magnification); sections = 100 μm (×200 magnification).In contrast to controls, E2-treated male (ZZ) gonads analyzed at E9.5 had increased asymmetry, similar to that seen in control females (Fig. 2B, ZZ). The left gonads of E2-treated male embryos showed development of an ovarian-like cortex, evidenced by the cortical localization of CVH-positive PGCs (Fig. 2B, I). PGCs were also localized in the medulla of left male E2-treated gonads in what appeared to be disorganized testis cords (Fig. 2B, i). In these gonads, DMRT1 was expressed both in the disorganized testis cords in the medulla and in the ovarian-like cortex (Fig. 2B, iii). Aromatase expression was induced in the medulla of male E2-treated left gonads but at a lower level than that observed in control female gonads (Fig. 2B, ii, “m”). The morphology, PGC localization and DMRT1 and aromatase expression levels were not significantly altered in E2-treated female gonads compared to controls (Fig. 2B, ZW, iv–vi). These results indicated that estrogen treatment was able to disrupt testis differentiation and partially feminize male gonads.Treatment with AI did not affect male (ZZ) gonadal development but resulted in masculinization of female (ZW) gonads. This was evident from an increase in left-right gonadal symmetry (Fig. 2C). Left and right female AI-treated gonads were thin and elongated, similar to the morphology of control male gonads (Fig. 2C, ZW). The left gonads of female AI-treated embryos also had reduced cortical development (Fig. 2C, iv–vi). Some CVH-positive PGCs were present in the residual cortex, but most were relocalized in a testis cord-like pattern in the medulla (Fig. 2C, iv). Aromatase expression was reduced in female AI-treated gonads compared to controls (Fig. 2C, v). Conversely, expression of DMRT1 was up-regulated in testis cord-like structures in the medulla of female AI-treated gonads (Fig. 2C, vi). These results indicated that blocking endogenous estrogen synthesis was able to disrupt ovarian differentiation and partially masculinize female gonads.Quantitative RT-PCR was used to analyze the expression of known genetic markers of testis and ovary differentiation. During normal testicular development, DMRT1 and SOX9 are up-regulated in male gonads, while FOXL2 and CYP19A1 (aromatase) are up-regulated in female gonads during ovarian development. As expected, control male gonads from the AI and E2 experiments expressed both DMRT1 and SOX9 (Fig. 3, C and D, male), while aromatase mRNA was not detected (Fig. 3A, male), and FOXL2 levels were negilgible (Fig. 3B, male). However, in male E2-treated gonads, aromatase expression was induced, and FOXL2 expression was significantly up-regulated (Fig. 3, A and B, P < 0.01, E2). In contrast, DMRT1 and SOX9 expression levels were significantly reduced in E2-treated male gonads (Fig. 3C; P < 0.01; Fig. 3D, P < 0.001, E2). The expression of all four genes was not significantly altered in female E2-treated gonads versus controls (Fig. 3, E2). Together, these results confirmed that ovarian-like gene expression was present in partially feminized male gonads following estrogen treatment.Altered sex-marker expression in E2- and AI-treated gonads. Sex marker expression measured by qRT-PCR in paired E9.5 gonads. A) aromatase (CYP19A1), (B) FOXL2, (C) DMRT1, and (D) SOX9. Embryos were treated with E2 at E4.5 and AI at E3.5 (black bars). Controls (gray bars) for estrogen (E2) were injected with 95% ethanol (E2). Controls for AI were injected with PBS. Expression levels were normalized to HPRT reference control and are shown as fold difference relative to either control male (DMRT1 and SOX9) or control female (CYP19A1/aromatase and FOXL2). Error bars show standard error of the mean (SEM) from at least three biological replicates in each group. Statistical significance shown by asterisks: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.As expected, control female gonads in AI and E2 experiments showed expression of CYP19A1 (aromatase) and FOXL2 (Fig. 3, A and B) but had lower levels of DMRT1 expression compared to control males, and expression of SOX9 was negligible (Fig. 3, C and B). Female AI-treated gonads had significantly reduced levels of CYP19A1 (aromatase) and FOXL2 expression (Fig. 3A, P < 0.001; Fig. 3B, P < 0.001, AI), while DMRT1 and SOX9 expression levels were elevated (Fig. 3C, P < 0.01; Fig. 3D, P < 0.05, AI). The levels of all four genes were not significantly different between control and AI-treated male gonads (Fig. 3, AI). These results confirmed that testis-associated gene expression was present in partially masculinized female gonads following the inhibition of estrogen synthesis.Having confirmed that estrogen modulation affects both morphological and molecular signatures of embryonic testis and ovary development, we analyzed MIR202* expression in E2- and AI-treated gonads using WISH and qRT-PCR (Figs. 4 and 5). As expected, both WISH and qRT-PCR analyses showed elevated MIR202* expression in male versus female control gonads at E9.5 (Figs. 4 and 5). WISH analysis showed that MIR202* expression was reduced in male E2-treated gonads with feminized morphology (Fig. 4A, asterisks, n = 7). This was also confirmed by qRT-PCR. MIR202* expression was approximately 3.5-fold lower in E2-treated versus control male gonads (Fig. 4B, MIR202*). In the WISH analysis, MIR202* expression levels appeared similar between female E2-treated gonads versus controls (Fig. 4A, n = 13). However, qRT-PCR analysis showed that MIR202* expression was also reduced in E2-treated female gonads versus control female gonads (Fig. 4B). Therefore, these results indicated that MIR202* expression is reduced in response to estrogen treatment in both male and female embryonic gonads.MIR202* expression in E2-treated E9.5 gonads. Embryos were treated by direct in ovo injection with E2 (+E2) or 95% ethanol (EtOH, control) at E4.5. A) WISH analysis of MIR202* expression (purple staining) in E9.5 whole-mount urogenital systems. Gonads are outlined. Asterisks indicate down-regulation of MIR202*. Images are ×2.5 magnification; scale bars = 1 mm. B) qRT-PCR quantification of MIR202* and MIR107 expression in E9.5 gonads. Expression for both miRNAs was normalized to U6 snRNA as a reference control. Expression shown as fold difference relative to male EtOH control. Error bars show standard error of the mean (SEM) from at least three biological replicates in each group. Statistical significance shown by asterisks: **P < 0.01. Expression of MIR107 was not significantly different between control and E2-treated gonads.MIR202* expression in AI-treated E9.5 gonads. Embryos were treated by direct in ovo injection with AI (+AI) or PBS (control) at E3.5. A) WISH analysis of MIR202* (purple staining) in E9.5 whole-mount urogenital systems. Gonads are outlined. Asterisks indicate up-regulation of MIR202*. Images are ×2.5 magnification; scale bars = 1 mm. B) qRT-PCR quantification of MIR202* and MIR107 expression in E9.5 gonads. Expression for both miRNAs was normalized to U6 snRNA as a reference control. Error bars show standard error of the mean (SEM) from three or more biological replicates in each group. Statistical significance shown by asterisks: **P < 0.01. Expression of MIR107 was not significantly different between control and AI-treated gonads.Using WISH analysis, female AI-treated gonads with masculinized morphology showed increased MIR202* expression compared to female controls (Fig. 5A, asterisks, n = 15). This was also confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis, where MIR202* expression was 2-fold up-regulated in AI-treated versus control female gonads (Fig. 5B). Both WISH and qRT-PCR analyses indicated no significant difference in MIR202* expression between control and AI-treated male gonads (Fig. 5, A and B).To confirm that altered MIR202* expression was a specific response to estrogen modulation and not due to estrogen mediated regulation of miRNA biogenesis in general, the expression of a nonsexually dimorphic miRNA, MIR107, was also measured in control, E2-, and AI-treated gonads. MIR107 did not show sexually dimorphic expression in control E9.5 gonads (Fig. 4B, MIR107). MIR107 expression levels were also not significantly different between male or female gonads following either E2 or AI treatment (Figs. 4 and 5, MIR107). These results demonstrated that estrogen modulation specifically affected sexually dimorphic MIR202* expression in the embryonic gonads. Taken together with the results of the morphological and molecular analyses, these findings confirm that up-regulation of MIR202* expression coincides with testicular differentiation.Tissue-specific miRNA expression patterns during embryonic development may reflect specialized functions for miRNAs in organogenesis [37]. Understanding how these expression patterns are regulated may provide insight into the functions of tissue-specific miRNAs. Our previous studies suggested that MIR202* expression, being male biased in embryonic chicken gonads, is regulated in a sexually dimorphic manner during sexual differentiation [16]. Here, we have confirmed that from E6.5, MIR202* expression is specifically up-regulated in male gonads but remains low in female gonads (Fig. 1).MIR202* expresion has not been reported in the embryonic gonads of other vertebrates. However, MIR202* homologues (also known as miR-202-5p) show enriched expression in the adult or postnatal testes of several other vertebrates, including mice: postnatal [27, 38] and adult [26], humans [39], Xenopus laevis [40], and Tasmanian devil (an Australian marsupial) [41]. This shows that testis-enriched MIR202* expression is generally conserved among mammalian and nonmammalian vertebrates. Our study, however, is the first to demonstrate that MIR202* is specifically up-regulated during testicular differentiation using an experimental system. We could redirect MIR202* expression toward female levels in feminized male gonads treated with estrogen and enhance MIR202* expression in masculinized female gonads treated with an AI. Based on these findings, we conclude that MIR202* up-regulation is a reliable marker of testicular differentiation in the chicken embryo.Changes in gonadal morphology and the expression of known testis- and ovary-associated genes are known to occur following estrogen modulation of gonadal differentiation [6, 12–15, 32]. The reduction of MIR202* expression in estrogen-treated versus control male E9.5 gonads correlated with morphological and histological changes characteristic of ovarian differentiation, namely, an increase in gonadal asymmetry and the development of an ovarian-like cortex containing relocalized PGCs in the left gonad (Fig. 2). Altered expression of DMRT1, SOX9, FOXL2, and CYP19A1 (aromatase) toward an ovary-associated profile also occurred in male estrogen-treated gonads. Therefore, this provides experimental evidence to confirm that low levels of MIR202* expression are associated with ovarian differentiation.In conjunction with increased MIR202* expression, AI-treated female versus control E9.5 gonads showed signs of testicular differentiation, including enhanced bilateral symmetry and the formation of medullary testis cord-like structures containing PGCs (Fig. 2). Increased levels of DMRT1 and SOX9 expression and reduced expression of CYP19A1 (aromatase) and FOXL2 in these gonads also demonstrated evidence of masculinized gonadal development at the molecular level. Hence, up-regulation of MIR202* expression occurs during testiscular differentiation. The expression of a nonsexually dimorphic miRNA, MIR107 [16], was unchanged in estrogen- or AI-treated gonads (Figs. 4B and 5B), further confirming that the observed changes in MIR202* expression in AI- and estrogen-treated gonads were a specific response to altered sexual differentiation. Together, these findings confirm that MIR202* expression levels in embryonic chicken gonads are differentially regulated during testicular versus ovarian differentiation.In female gonads, estrogen is synthesized in the medulla by aromatase [8, 9, 36] and activates estrogen receptor 1, ESR1 (also known as ERα), in the cortical epithelium to promote ovarian differentiation [8, 31, 36, 42]. Estrogen treatment resulted in a decline in MIR202* expression in both male and female gonads (Fig. 4B). Therefore, we considered the possibility that estrogen signaling itself may act to suppress MIR202* expression in embryonic chicken gonads. Intuitively, this is likely to involve an indirect pathway given that MIR202* is expressed primarily in the medulla of male and female gonads [16], while ESR1 is activated primarily in the cortical epithelium as ovarian differentiation proceeds [8, 31, 36].However, exogenous estrogen treatment creates an artificial environment for gonadal differentiation. Therefore, it could be argued that the down-regulation observed in female E2-treated gonads does not reflect the normal pathway of MIR202* regulation in ovarian differentiation. If negative regulation of MIR202* is normally mediated by estrogen signaling, MIR202* expression in female gonads would be expected to decrease as estrogen levels increase during ovarian differentiation. Our data show that this is not the case. MIR202* expression does not decrease in female gonads between E6.5 and E9.5 (Fig. 1), suggesting that negative regulation by estrogen signaling is not primarily responsible for the low level of MIR202* expression seen in female gonads. Therefore, we favor the conclusion that male-biased MIR202* expression is established primarily by male-specific up-regulation during testicular differentiation.In birds, DMRT1 promotes testicular differentiation in a dosage-dependent manner [3] and is expressed in a male-biased manner from E4.5 on [5]. SOX9 is a conserved testis-determining gene and is up-regulated in a male-specific manner from E6.0 on [43–45]. Up-regulation of MIR202* in male gonads follows the onset of testicular differentiation at E6.5 (Fig. 1) and therefore must occur downstream of DMRT1 and SOX9 up-regulation. MIR202* expression levels in E2- and AI-treated gonads are also altered in the same direction as DMRT1 and SOX9, confirming that MIR202* up-regulation is characteristic of testicular differentiation. MIR202* expression is restricted to the testis cords in male gonads at E6.5 andE9.5 [16], which is similar to the localization of known or postulated testis-determining genes, including DMRT1 [3, 32] and SOX9 [44, 45]. Therefore, we believe that MIR202* expression is likely to be regulated by the testis-determining pathway. Confirming this will require further studies to demonstrate a direct relationship between MIR202* and DMRT1, SOX9, or other male-specific genes, such as anti-Mullerian hormone [44, 46]. We are currently working to characterize the primary transcript and promoter sequences of MIR202* to address this need.The function of MIR202* is currently unknown. We predict that miRNAs that act to promote sexual differentiation should show sexually dimorphic expression in the embryonic gonads prior to E6.5. Given that MIR202* expression levels are similar between male and female gonads at E5.5 and are not significantly dimorphic at E6.5, MIR202* is up-regulated as a consequence of testicular differentiation and therefore is unlikely to be involved in initiating testicular differentiation. Based on this profile, we propose that MIR202* may play a role in maintaining testicular development after differentiation is initiated. Our laboratory is currently using overexpression and knockdown approaches to identify testis-specific target genes and to investigate the function of MIR202* in the embryonic chicken testes.Studies of MIR202* expression at posthatch and adult stages of chicken testicular development are also warranted given a recent study of testicular miRNA expression in Xenopus. Michalack and colleages recently reported that Xenopus MIR202* (xtr-miR-202-5p) is down-regulated in the testes of sterile X. laevis/X. mullerei male hybrids versus those of normal fertile X. laevis males [40]. Therefore, changes in testicular MIR202* expression levels correlate with altered fertility levels in adult male frogs. Whether this indicates a wider role for MIR202* in spermatogenesis remains to be shown.In summary, MIR202* expression is specifically up-regulated in male embryonic chicken gonads from E6.5 on. Using estrogen modulation, we have demonstrated that sexual differentiation accounts for the male-biased MIR202* expression profile seen in endogenous gonads. Low levels of MIR202* expression correlate with ovarian differentiation, and up-regulation of MIR202* is associated with testicular differentiation. Furthermore, changes in MIR202* expression induced by estrogen modulation occur in the same direction as known testis-associated genes DMRT1 and SOX9. From these findings, we conclude that MIR202* up-regulation is a marker of testicular differentiation in the chicken embryo.The authors wish to thank Dr. Michelle Wilkins and Dr. Tracey Hinton for critical analysis of the manuscript and Susanne Wilson (CSIRO Livestock Industries) for her assistance with ordering, setting, and monitoring of embryonated eggs for these experiments.Google ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarSupported by Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Grant (C.A.S. and A.H.S.) and CSIRO Livestock Industries Project Funding (M.L.V.T. and T.J.D.).

The GSP and PNP/DO inbred lines were both derived from the Fayoumi breed and are only differentiated based on the red blood cell antigen type carried by each inbred line. Combs and wattles were found to be significantly bigger (P<0.05) in the GSP ovx compared with the PNP/DO ovx chickens, although male plumage patterns were more pronounced in the PNP/DO ovx. Spurs were observed both in the GSP and PNP/DO ovx chickens with no significant difference (P>0.05) in length compared with the respective male controls, and body weight was not significantly different (P>0.05) compared with the female controls. The weight of the right gonad was significantly heavier (P<0.05) in the GSP ovx than in the PNP/DO ovx. Positive correlations were found in the sex-related characters as well as the plasma testosterone level and right gonad weight in both the GSP and PNP/DO ovx chickens, but not in the spur length, which showed a negative correlation in the PNP/DO ovx chickens. Histological analysis revealed that the right gonads of the PNP/DO ovx chickens were morphologically developed compared with the GSP ovx chickens, which showed more advance stages of spermatogenesis. It could be inferred that PNP/DO females that exhibit a hereditary persistent right oviduct are more responsive to the masculinizing effect of ovariectomy compared with GSP females, suggesting that genetic background may have a possible contribution to the degree of masculinization and subsequent development of sex related characters.The Japanese journal of animal reproductionThe Japanese journal of animal reproductionPurchase access to all full-text HTML articles for 6 or 36 hr at a low cost.

267–271(2009)Cite this article1243 Accesses444 Citations22 AltmetricMetricsSex in birds is chromosomally based, as in mammals, but the sex chromosomes are different and the mechanism of avian sex determination has been a long-standing mystery1,2,3. In the chicken and all other birds, the homogametic sex is male (ZZ) and the heterogametic sex is female (ZW). Two hypotheses have been proposed for the mechanism of avian sex determination. The W (female) chromosome may carry a dominant-acting ovary determinant4,5,6. Alternatively, the dosage of a Z-linked gene may mediate sex determination, two doses being required for male development (ZZ)7,8. A strong candidate avian sex-determinant under the dosage hypothesis is the conserved Z-linked gene, DMRT1 (doublesex and mab-3-related transcription factor 1)9,10,11. Here we used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down DMRT1 in early chicken embryos. Reduction of DMRT1 protein expression in ovo leads to feminization of the embryonic gonads in genetically male (ZZ) embryos. Affected males show partial sex reversal, characterized by feminization of the gonads. The feminized left gonad shows female-like histology, disorganized testis cords and a decline in the testicular marker, SOX9. The ovarian marker, aromatase, is ectopically activated. The feminized right gonad shows a more variable loss of DMRT1 and ectopic aromatase activation, suggesting differential sensitivity to DMRT1 between left and right gonads. Germ cells also show a female pattern of distribution in the feminized male gonads. These results indicate that DMRT1 is required for testis determination in the chicken. Our data support the Z dosage hypothesis for avian sex determination.Subscribe to JournalGet full journal access for 1 year185,98 €only 3,65 € per issueAll prices are NET prices.

One hypothesis posits that the dosage of a Z-linked gene may mediate sex determination, two doses being required for male development (ZZ). Here Smith . show that reducing expression in early chicken embryos feminizes the embryonic gonads in genetically male (ZZ) embryos. This study shows that is required for testis formation and lends support to the theory that a double dose of a Z-linked gene is needed to make bird embryos male.Nature | News & ViewsNature

In the present study, the dosage effect of Fadrozole, a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, on gonadal differentiation was analyzed in sex-reversed genetic female chicken. There was no significant difference for the hatchability among low-dose (0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 mg) Fadrozole-injected groups and control groups (p > 0.05), but in high-dose groups (1.0 mg and 1.3 mg) the hatchability was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). Complete phenotypic sex reversal was observed in both high- and low- dose groups, with more than 90% of genetic females reversed into phenotypic male chicks. The degree of gonadal differentiation in 124 chicken at 30 weeks of age was classified into 5 categories according to the visual appearance and histological structure of the gonads. Category I and V were standard ovary and testis, respectively, while category II, III, and IV represented gonads of slightly, moderately, and highly sex-reversed females, respectively. Most gonads in low-dose groups were classified into category I, II, and III, while those in high-dose groups were mainly category IV. The serum testosterone levels in the 1.3 mg group were significantly higher and the estradiol levels lower than those in low-dose groups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the range from 0.5 to 1.0 mg Fadrozole is a key interval for survival of chicken embryos. The gonadal differentiation in sex-reversed females at 30 weeks of age is highly dependent on the dose of Fadrozole injected prior to gonadal sex differentiation.© 2009 S.

Karger AG, BaselOur previous study demonstrated that elongated spermatids and sperm carrying the female-specific W-chromosome of the sex-reversed domestic fowl can activate the mouse oocyte, but whether they can fertilize the avian oocyte and lead to a developing zygote remains undetermined. A single sperm isolated from the semen and testis of normal rooster and from a testis of sex-reversed hen was microinjected into a quail oocyte and cultured for 20 to 24 h. Blastoderms were fixed, cleaved, nuclei stained by 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylin-dole, and developmental stages were assessed. In the normal rooster group, ejaculated and testicular sperm induced blastodermal development in 22.6 and 20% of the quail oocytes, respectively. The developmental stages ranged from IV to VII. In the sex-reversal group, 20% of injected testicular sperm induced blastodermal development. The blastodermal stages varied from stage III to VI. Blastoderms after 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining were assayed by PCR to identify the W chromosome of either chicken sperm or quail oocyte. The PCR assay results showed that 2 out of 9 developed blastoderms microinjected with sperm of sex-reversed hen were identified containing the female-specific W chromosome derived from sex-reversed hen. From these results, it is concluded that chicken sperm bearing the W chromosome possess fertilizing ability and can function to stimulate blastoderm development similar to that of normal chicken sperm carrying the Z chromosome.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

In the present study, sex reversal was induced by injection of a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (Fadrozole) into the air sac of the chicken egg on d 4 of incubation, and the chicks were reared to 18 mo old. A single elongated spermatid or sperm was isolated from the testis from either normal roosters or sex-reversed hens, and each was microinjected into a mouse oocyte and cultured for 24 h. Although injected oocytes were monitored on the stage of microscope, they were classified into groups by the number of pronuclei. Those that showed male and female pronuclei (2PN) were considered to have oocyte-activating potency. In the normal rooster group, most semen and testicular sperm induced 2PN, whereas only half of the elongated spermatids induced 2PN. In the sex-reversal group, most testicular sperm induced 2PN, whereas nearly half of the elongated spermatids induced 2PN in the oocytes. There was no pronucleus in the oocytes after microinjection of medium only. A second experiment confirmed the higher rate of oocyte activation by testicular sperm than testicular elongated spermatids. In this second experiment, individual oocytes injected with spermatids and sperm of sex-reversed hens were assayed by PCR to identify the W chromosome. Most spermatids and sperm carried Z chromosome, whereas a minority carried W chromosome. However, the sperm carrying W chromosome evoked 2PN with the same rate of oocyte activation as those carrying Z chromosome. From these results, it is concluded that the chicken elongated spermatids and sperm carrying W chromosome may possess a fertilizing ability similar to normal chicken sperm carrying the Z chromosome.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Learn about our remote access optionsP450‐aromatase is the terminal estrogen‐synthesizing enzyme and a key gene in avian sex determination. Aromatase is expressed specifically in female gonads, but not male gonads, at the onset of sexual differentiation. This enzyme shows temporal and spatial colocalization with the forkhead transcription factor FOXL2 in the embryonic chicken ovary, suggesting a causal link. Mutations in FOXL2 are associated with premature ovarian failure in humans. Foxl2 null mice also present with premature ovarian failure. Here, we show that FOXL2 expression is reduced but not abolished in chicken embryos subjected to experimental female to male sex‐reversal with an aromatase inhibitor. This finding suggests that FOXL2 lies upstream of aromatase in avian sex determination, but that it responds to depleted estrogen synthesis. The reduction in FOXL2 expression may be accounted for by interruption of a positive feedback loop by means of estrogen, or the influence of testis promoting factors such as SOX9 and DMRT1 in the masculinized gonads. Developmental Dynamics 233:1052–1055, 2005. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.Gonadal development is morphologically conserved in vertebrates, and the chicken embryo has been widely used as a model to study gonadogenesis and sex determination. In mammals, with an XX (female), XY (male) sex chromosome system, the dominant Y‐linked testis‐determinant SRY is responsible for sex determination (Sinclair et al., 1990; Koopman et al., 1991). In contrast, birds have a ZZ (male), ZW (female) sex chromosome system, and it is unclear whether sex is determined by a dose‐dependent gene on the Z, or a dominant W‐linked gene (Smith and Sinclair, 2004). In the chick, the bipotential gonad begins to form on the ventral‐medial surface of the mesonephric kidney around Hamburger‐Hamilton stage 18 (embryonic day [E] 3.0; Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951). At E6.5 (stage 30), the beginning of histological differentiation into testis or ovary first becomes apparent. This coincides with the onset of expression of the transcription factor SOX9 in the embryonic testis, and terminal estrogen‐synthesising enzyme P450‐aromatase in the embryonic ovary (Smith and Sinclair, 2004). Estrogen is required for ovarian development (Elbrecht and Smith, 1992); therefore, the genes regulating aromatase expression are key to avian sex determination.The regulatory factor activating aromatase in avian sex determination is at present unknown. A good candidate, however, is the forkhead transcription factor FOXL2. FOXL2 expression is conserved in early vertebrate ovary development (Loffler et al., 2003). In humans, mutations in FOXL2 cause blepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) type I, an autosomal dominant disorder associated with premature ovarian failure (Crisponi et al., 2001). The mouse Foxl2 knockout also shows premature ovarian failure (Schmidt et al., 2004; Uda et al., 2004). Similarly, the polled intersex syndrome (PIS) mutation in goats is associated with autosomal recessive female to male sex‐reversal, and involves a deletion 200 kb from FOXL2, down‐regulating FOXL2 expression (Pailhoux et al., 2001). Polled goats show a reduction in aromatase expression, suggesting that FOXL2 may play a role in regulating aromatase (Pailhoux et al., 2002). In the chicken embryo, FOXL2 and aromatase colocalize to the medulla of the ovary and FOXL2 expression begins before aromatase (Govoroun et al., 2004). This is consistent with FOXL2 playing a role in regulating aromatase. To investigate the interaction between FOXL2 and aromatase further, we have treated chicken embryos with the aromatase inhibitor (AI) fadrozole, which induces partial female to male sex‐reversal. Here, we present the effect of AI treatment on FOXL2 expression.The undifferentiated early chick gonad consists of the outer cortical layer and the inner medulla, with the germ cells located throughout the gonad. In males, bilateral testes develop with the cortex regressing and the medulla proliferating, giving rise to seminiferous cords enclosing germ cells. In normal females an asymmetry occurs, with the left ovary developing and the right gonad regressing. In the left ovary, the cortex proliferates and contains the germ cells, whereas the medulla is fragmented, with medullary cords interspersed with lacunae (luminal spaces). The regressing right gonad becomes significantly smaller than the left ovary and loses the cortical layer.To assess the effectiveness of fadrozole aromatase inhibition, we first conducted aromatase immunohistochemistry on normal and treated females at E9.5 (Fig. 1). In a normal left ovary, aromatase protein was detected throughout the medulla and was absent from the cortex (Fig. 1A). The smaller regressing right gonad lacked a cortex, and aromatase was detected throughout the medullary cords of the gonad (Fig. 1C). The AI‐treated left gonad was around 50% smaller than the untreated (assessed from digital photos of whole urogenital systems), with a reduced cortical layer and greatly reduced aromatase expression (Fig. 1B). The AI‐treated right gonad was masculinized and almost completely devoid of aromatase expression (Fig. 1D). These results are consistent with previous studies demonstrating aromatase inhibition and masculinization of ZW gonads treated with fadrozole (Smith et al., 2003).Confirmation of aromatase inhibitor (AI) action as assessed by aromatase immunohistochemistry. A: In phosphate buffered saline (PBS) ‐injected female chicks at embryonic day (E) 9.5 (stage 36), aromatase is strongly expressed in the medulla (md) and is absent from the cortex (c) of the left ovary. C: Aromatase is strongly expressed throughout the medullary cords of the female right gonad, which lacks a cortex. B,D: AI‐treated embryos at E9.5 show greatly reduced aromatase expression in the left gonad (B), and expression is almost completely absent in the right gonad (D). Scale bar = 100 μm.We examined the expression of FOXL2 by whole‐mount in situ hybridization in chicken embryos treated with AI at E3.5 (stage 21; Fig. 2). In normal PBS control‐treated males, no expression of FOXL2 was seen before (E5.5, stage 27–28), during (E7.5, stage 32), or after (E9.5, stage 36) gonadal sex differentiation (Fig. 2A–C). Aromatase inhibition had no discernable effect on male gonad development, and no FOXL2 expression was seen in AI‐treated males (not shown). In PBS control females, expression was first seen at E5.5, one day before the onset of sexual differentiation (Fig. 2D). Expression was then strongly up‐regulated at E7.5 and E9.5 after the commencement of ovarian differentiation (Fig. 2E,F). In AI‐treated females, the onset of FOXL2 expression at E5.5 was not affected (compare Fig. 2D with G). However, expression remained low at E7.5 and E9.5 compared with control females (compare Fig. 2E,F with H,I). The gross morphology of AI‐treated female gonads at E7.5 and E9.5 was masculinized, with bilateral male‐like shape and a loss of typical female asymmetry (Fig. 2H,I).Expression of FOXL2 during chick gonadogenesis in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) ‐injected controls and aromatase inhibitor (AI) ‐treated individuals, as assessed by whole‐mount in situ hybridization. A–C: In male PBS controls, no gonad expression is detected at E5.5 (stage 27–28), E7.5 (stage 32), and E9.5 (stage 36). D: In female PBS controls, low‐level expression is detected in the gonad (g) and not the mesonephros (me) at E5.5. E,F: Expression is strongly up‐regulated at E7.5 and E9.5. G–I: In AI‐treated females, low‐level expression is detected at E5.5, and expression remains weak at E7.5 and E9.5. Scale bar = 500 μm.To examine localization of FOXL2 gonadal expression in females subjected to AI treatment, whole‐mount stained gonads were sectioned (Fig. 3). At E7.5 in normal females, FOXL2 expression localized to the medulla of the left ovary, and was absent from the cortex (Fig. 3A). In AI‐treated females, the left ovary was around 100% smaller, with a reduced cortex and reduced FOXL2 expression in the medulla (Fig. 3B). In the normal right gonad, FOXL2 expression localized to the medulla and only a limited cortical layer was present compared to the left ovary (Fig. 3C). In AI‐treated females, the right gonad was approximately 20% smaller and FOXL2 expression decreased, but expression did not appear to be reduced to the same extent as in the AI‐treated left ovary (Fig. 3D). At E9.5 in the normal left ovary, FOXL2 expression localized to the medulla (Fig. 3E). This expression colocalized with aromatase protein (Fig. 1A), confirming previous studies (Govoroun et al., 2004). In AI‐treated females, the left ovary was around 50% smaller, with a reduced cortical layer and reduced FOXL2 expression (Fig. 3F). In normal right gonads, the cortical layer was lost, and FOXL2 expression localized to the medullary cords and appeared to be at a lower level than the left ovary (Figs. 2F, 3G). In AI‐treated females, the right gonad was around 50% smaller and rounded, but FOXL2 expression did not appear to be reduced compared to the control (Fig. 3H). In summary, aromatase inhibition caused a reduction in FOXL2 expression in the left ovary, but expression still localized to the medullary cords. However, the cords were more disorganized, with a reduction in lacunae, a reduction in the cortex layer, and an overall reduction in gonad size. As in previous studies, the right gonad was more masculinized by aromatase inhibition, with the gonad becoming smaller and more rounded, and lacunae spaces disappearing as more male‐like medullary cords are assembled in the gonad (Smith et al., 2003). Of interest, the reduction in FOXL2 expression in the AI‐treated right gonads did not appear to be as great as in the left gonads, as assessed on sections. In humans, mutations in FOXL2 cause BPES syndrome, which, apart from premature ovarian failure, is also associated with eyelid defects (Crisponi et al., 2001). However, no gross eyelid defects were observed in AI‐treated chicken embryos.Localization of FOXL2 gonad expression in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) ‐injected controls and aromatase inhibitor (AI) ‐treated female chicks, assessed by sections through whole‐mount in situ hybridization stained urogenital systems. A: At embryonic day (E) 7.5 (stage 32) in the left ovary of PBS controls, FOXL2 is expressed in the medulla (md) and is absent from the cortex (c). B: The left gonad of AI‐treated females is smaller, with a reduced cortex and reduced expression. C: The right gonad of PBS controls has a reduced cortex, and FOXL2 is expressed throughout the medullary cords of the gonad. D: The right gonad of AI‐treated females is smaller, and expression is reduced. E: At E9.5 (stage 36) in the left ovary of PBS controls, FOXL2 is expressed in the medulla and not the cortex. F: The left gonad of AI‐treated females is smaller, with a reduced cortex and reduced expression. G: The right gonad of PBS controls is smaller than the left, has a reduced cortex, and FOXL2 is expressed throughout the gonad. H: The right gonad of AI‐treated females is smaller and rounded compared to the untreated gonad, and the expression level appears unchanged. Scale bar = 100 μm.Previous studies have shown that the candidate testis‐inducing genes, DMRT1 and SOX9, are up‐regulated in ZW (female) gonads after aromatase inhibition (Smith et al., 2003). The reduction in FOXL2 expression reported here may be due to either loss of estrogen synthesis, or the concomitant activation of male‐specific genes, such as SOX9, which may then down‐regulate FOXL2. The former suggests that, while aromatase‐synthesized estrogen does not activate the FOXL2 gene, it may normally contribute to the maintenance of FOXL2 expression.FOXL2 gonadal expression was reduced but not abolished by aromatase inhibition, suggesting that FOXL2 is upstream from aromatase in the chicken sex determination pathway. This finding is supported by the onset of FOXL2 expression at E5.5, just before aromatase expression at E6.5 (Govoroun et al., 2004). It would be interesting to determine whether adding estrogen to feminize male embryos would induce FOXL2 expression. We would predict that it would not, as our results suggest FOXL2 is upstream of aromatase. We have conducted this experiment and did not see any expression of FOXL2 in estrogen‐treated males (results not shown). However, in agreement with previous studies, the feminizing effects of estrogen treatment were transient and inconsistent (Scheib, 1983). Whereas FOXL2 may be involved in up‐regulating aromatase, a key step in female avian sex determination, it cannot be the trigger for sex determination in birds as it is not sex‐linked (Loffler et al., 2003). Bioinformatics analysis of the FOXL2 promoter region did not reveal any obvious transcription factor binding sites for candidate ovary‐determining factors. No estrogen response elements were detected in the FOXL2 promoter, although FOXL2 binding sites have been noted in the aromatase promoter (Govoroun et al., 2004).The pointy end of the egg was injected with 100 μl of fadrozole (10 mg/ml) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or PBS control at E3.5 (Hamburger–Hamilton stage 21). Urogenital systems were harvested at E5.5 (stage 27–28), E7.5 (stage 32), and E9.5 (stage 36) for whole‐mount in situ hybridization analysis. A sample of E9.5 urogenital systems was fixed for 10 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, cryoprotected in 20% sucrose in PBS at 4°C overnight, then embedded in OCT and snap frozen for cryosectioning. The 10‐μm sections were subjected to aromatase antibody histochemistry to confirm that aromatase inhibitor treatment was successful, as previously described (Smith et al., 2003). Staining was developed using diaminobenzidine chromogen.Embryos were sexed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a W‐linked (female‐specific) XhoI repeat sequence, with GAPDH amplified as an internal control, as described previously (Smith et al., 2003).Chick embryonic urogenital systems (E5.5, E7.5, and E9.5) were fixed overnight at 4°C in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, then dehydrated through a methanol series on ice. Whole‐mount in situ hybridization was carried out using digoxiginin‐labeled riboprobes as previously described (Andrews et al., 1997). A 294‐base pair FOXL2 fragment was PCR‐amplified using primers FOXL2 F8 (TACTCGTACGTGGCCCTGATCGC) and FOXL2 R8 (CCGGAAAGGCCGCTTCATCC), cloned into pGEM‐T easy (Promega) and used as a riboprobe template. All tissues were left in nitroblue tetrazolium/5‐bromo‐4‐chloro‐3‐indolyl phosphate (NBT/BCIP) chromogen for 4 hr to allow staining to develop. Staining was only present in tissues exposed to the antisense probe, with no staining observed in the sense probe negative control. For sectioning, tissues were left in chromogen for 2 days, then cryoprotected and frozen in OCT, as described above. A cryostat was used to cut 14‐μm sections to examine staining localization.Volume233, Issue3July 2005Pages 1052-1055Copyright © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.Working off-campus? Learn about our remote access optionsA genetic switch determines whether the indifferent gonad develops into an ovary or a testis. In adult females of many avian species, the left ovary is functional while the right one regresses. In the embryo, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) mediate biological effects in many organ developments but their roles in avian sex determination and gonadal differentiation remains largely unknown. Here, we report the sex‐specific and left‐right (L‐R) asymmetric expression pattern of Bmp7 in the chicken gonadogenesis. Bmp7 was L‐R asymmetrically expressed at the beginning of genital ridge formation. After sexual differentiation occurred, sex‐specific expression pattern of Bmp7 was observed in the ovary mesenchyme. In addition, ovary‐specific Bmp7 expression was reduced in experimentally induced female‐to‐male reversal using the aromatase inhibitor (AI). These dynamic changes of expression pattern of Bmp7 in the gonad with or without AI treatment suggest that BMP may play roles in determination of L‐R asymmetric development and sex‐dependent differentiation in the avian gonadogenesis.The constitution of sex chromosomes in vertebrates is either XX females and XY males, as in mammals, or ZW females and ZZ males, as in birds and some reptiles. The gene Sry, which triggers male sex determination, is present on the Y chromosome of mammals (Gubbay et al. 1990; Sinclair et al. 1990), but its molecular function is still not fully understood. Also, the molecular mechanisms underlying the morphogenesis of male and female gonads, which is similar between mammals and birds in many respects, are still obscure.In the chicken embryo, gonadal organogenesis begins around day 4.0 of incubation (day 4) with the appearance of the genital ridge, a thickening of the coelomic epithelium on the medial aspect of the mesonephros in which primordial germ cells (PGC), migrating from the germinal crescent, are going to settle (Merchant‐Larios et al. 1984). The origin of gonad somatic components is still under debate. It has been suggested that these cells derive from the coelomic epithelium, from the subjacent mesenchyme, or from the mesonephros (Merchant‐Larios et al. 1984). Histologically, ovaries and testes can be distinguished from day 6.5. In male gonads, testicular cords consisting of Sertoli cells and germ cells are delimited by a basement membrane, and this fundamental structure is established rather early in the development. In contrast, the ovarian organization is only completed after hatching with the formation of follicles harboring the oocytes in the cortex. Left‐right (L‐R) gonadal asymmetry in birds adds complexity to the process of differentiation. Asymmetry is manifested from day 3 in both sexes by a greater number of PGC colonizing the left gonad anlage (Van Limborgh 1968). The difference is greater in females than in males, constituting early evidence of some sex differentiation of the gonads. Additionally, volume and surface epithelium thickness are greater in the left gonad in both sexes. These differences disappear in males, whereas in females only the left ovary and left Müllerian ducts fully develop and become functional.Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) comprise the members of the decapentaplegic class (BMP2 and BMP4) and 60 A class (BMP5, BMP6, BMP7, BMP8A and BMP8B) in the transforming growth factor‐β (TGF‐β) superfamily. BMP are expressed during vertebrate development in the epithelia and/or mesenchymes at many sites of epithelial–mesenchymal interactions, such as digestive organs, lung, tooth and hair, implying that BMP signals serve as important mediators of various morphogenetic events (Bitgood & McMahon. 1995; Hogan 1996; Narita et al. 2000). But the information about the role of BMP in gonadogenesis is lacking. Although their involvement in the formation and function of urogenital systems has been reported (Dudley et al. 1995; Luo et al. 1995; Zhao & Hogan 1996, 1998; Lin et al. 2003; Glister et al. 2004).Bone morphogenetic proteins receptors, like the receptors for other members of the TGF‐β superfamily, consist of heterodimers of inducible and constitutively active kinases of type I and type II receptors, respectively (Koenig et al. 1994; Liu et al. 1995; Nohno et al. 1995; Rosenzweig et al. 1995). Brk1 (BMPR1a) and Brk2 (BMPR1b), also known as ALK3 and ALK6, respectively, are structurally related type 1 receptors for BMP (Kawakami et al. 1996). Brk3 (BMPR2) is a type 2 receptor. Both contain intracellular serine/threonine kinase domains and form heteromeric high affinity complexes for BMP to transduce external signals to an intracellular phosphorylation cascade involving members of the Smad family (Merino et al. 1999a).Recently, a growing number of secreted proteins have been discovered that antagonize BMP function. These BMP antagonists share the functional property of binding specifically to BMP, preventing their interaction with receptors. So far, a number of studies have analyzed the distribution and function of various BMP antagonists, such as Noggin (Brunet et al. 1998; Capdevila & Johnson 1998; Merino et al. 1998; Pizette & Niswander 1999), Chordin (Francis‐West et al. 1999), Follistatin (Merino et al. 1999b) and DAN family (Stanley et al. 1998; Pearce et al. 1999). DAN family is a member of a cystine knot protein family that includes DAN, Cerberus and Gremlin. During mouse embryogenesis, DAN (differential screening‐selected gene aberrative in neuroblastoma) is expressed in a restricted and dynamic pattern (Pearce et al. 1999).In the present study, to investigate possible involvement of BMP signaling in avian gonad development, we first studied mRNA expression of Bmp (Bmp2, Bmp4 and Bmp7), Bmp receptors (Brk1, Brk2 and Brk3), and Bmp antagonists (Noggin and DAN) in the embryonic gonads. Next, we examined the effects of AI which can cause female to male sex reversal on the gonadal expression of Bmp‐related genes by in situ hybridization. The results suggest that BMP play important roles in the different phases of gonad development such as L‐R asymmetry and sex‐related differentiation.Embryos of the White Leghorn chicken (Gallus gallus domestics) were used throughout the experiments. Eggs were warmed in the incubator at 38°C and the embryos were staged in days after the onset of incubation. Genotypes of embryos were determined as described previously (Kodama et al. 1987) with W chromosome‐specific repeating DNA as a marker.In situ hybridization was performed as previously described (Ishii et al. 1997). Digoxigenin labeled RNA probes for in situ hybridization were prepared from cDNA clones of chicken Bmp2, Bmp4, Bmp7, Brk1, Brk2, Brk3 (Kawakami et al. 1996), chicken Noggin (Tonegawa & Takahashi. 1998), chicken DAN (Ogita et al. 2001), chicken P450arom (Nakabayashi et al. 1998), chicken Pitx2 (Yoshioka et al. 1998) and chicken Ad4BP/SF1 (Kudo & Sutou 1999). The observation of each gene expression was done on two or more embryos.To identify distribution of PGC, immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (Tsunekawa et al. 2000) by using anti‐CVH (chicken VASA homologue; gift from Dr Tsunekawa) as primary antibody. The reaction was performed on sections previously subjected to in situ hybridization or on adjacent sections.On day 3, the eggs were treated with a single injection of AI (Fadrozole, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) at a dose of 0.1 mg in 0.1 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution into the air sac of eggs as described previously (Abinawanto et al. 1996). Control eggs received 0.9% NaCl solution alone. Shell holes were sealed with paraffin. Embryo and blood were collected individually on day 8. After determination of genotype of embryos gonads were used for in situ hybridization analysis.To elucidate the possible involvement of BMP in gonadogenesis, we analyzed the expression patterns of genes for Bmps (Bmp2, Bmp4 and Bmp7), Bmp receptors (Brk1, Brk2 and Brk3) and Bmp antagonists (Noggin and DAN) in gonads on day 5 by in situ hybridization on the sections. PGC were detected by anti‐CVH monoclonal antibody on the same section.On day 5, gonadal epithelium was starting to invade the gonadal mesenchyme to form first sexual cords. At this stage, expression of Bmp7 was observed in part of the invading epithelium and the mesenchyme lining the epithelium. Bmp7 expression was stronger in the left gonad than the right gonad (Fig. 1A). Expression of Brk3 was observed in the mesenchyme of the gonads on day 5 (Fig. 1B). DAN mRNA was detected in clusters of cells in the mesenchyme (Fig. 1C). Expression of Bmp7, DAN and Brk3 in the sexually indifferent gonads showed no obvious difference between male and female embryos.Expression of Bmp‐related genes in sex‐indifferent gonads. Expression of Bmp7 (A), Brk3 (B) and DAN (C) was examined by in situ hybridization of digoxigenin‐labeled RNA probes on cryostat sections and primordial germ cells (PGC) were visualized (brown) by immunohistochemistry on the same section of gonadal region in an embryo on day 5. Arrowheads indicate gonad. L, left; R, right. Bar, 100 µm.Expression of Bmp2, Bmp4, Brk1, Brk2 and Noggin was not observed in the gonadal region at any developmental stages examined (data not shown). Therefore, in a further investigation we examined more precisely the expression of Bmp7, Brk3 and DAN in the developing gonad.To assess the initial expression of Bmp7 in the chicken gonad, we performed in situ hybridization with gonads on day 3.5, 4.0 and 4.5 in which the genital ridge, a thickening of coelomic epithelium on the medial aspect of the mesonephros, represents a first sign of gonadal organogenesis.Bmp7 expression pattern in both sexes reflected left‐right asymmetry of germinal epithelium (Fig. 2A–C). The low level Bmp7 expression was first detected in the epithelial cells of the presumptive gonadal region on day 3.5 (Fig. 2A). PGC migrating towards the gonadal region were observed in the intermediate mesoderm and coelomic epithelium by CVH‐immunostain on the same section (Fig. 2A,B). CVH‐positive PGC were not observed in the region expressing Bmp7 in the presumptive gonadal region from day 3.5–4.0. On day 4.5, CVH‐expressing cells, now reaching the gonadal region, localized complementarily in the area expressing Bmp7 in the gonadal epithelium on day 4.5 (Fig. 2C).Asymmetric expression of Bmp7 at the beginning of genital ridge formation. Bmp7 expression in the gonadal epithelium region on day 3.5 (A), 4.0 (B) and 4.5 (C). Migrating PGC (brown) were observed in the intermediate mesoderm and coelomic epithelium. Arrowheads indicate presumptive gonadal epithelium. DM, dorsal mesentery; DA, dorsal aorta; L, left; R, right. Bar, 100 µm.Expression of Brk3 and DAN was scarcely detected in the early gonadal anlage (data not shown).On day 8, gonads showed definitive male or female characteristics. At this stage, the cortex of the ovary had high activity of proliferation and the PGC were clustered within the cortex.Bmp7 exhibited a female‐specific expression at this stage, the positive cells being present in the medulla in both left (Fig. 3D) and right (not shown) ovaries. Bmp7 mRNA was not detected in the testis (Fig. 3A). DAN was enriched in the ovary and almost all cells except germ cells were positive (Fig. 3F). In contrast, DAN was expressed only weakly in the testis (Fig. 3C).Sex‐specific expression of Bmp‐related genes after sexual differentiation. Expression of Bmp7 (A,D), Brk3 (B,E) and DAN (C,F) genes and localization of CVH (chicken VASA homologue) (brown) in the left male testis (A–C) and left female ovary (D–F) of day 8. Bar, 100 µm.Sexual cords in the male gonads started to form the seminiferous tubules of the testis. They contained two kinds of cells, PGC and the Sertoli cells derived from the germinal epithelial cells. Brk3 expression appeared clearly in the testicular cords except germ cells (Fig. 3B), while it was not detected in the ovary (Fig. 3E).Female gonads of day 15 were characterized by the development of the left ovarian cortex. The left ovary was made of a medulla containing lacunae and a well‐developed cortex. The right ovary, which stopped growing, is essentially composed of a medulla covered by a thin epithelium. In the testis, the developing testicular cords were more clearly delineated from the surrounding mesenchyme and basement membrane.Bmp7 expression was distributed throughout the medulla in the ovary while in the ovarian cortex and testis Bmp7‐positive cells were not detected (Fig. 4A,D). DAN expression was distributed widely throughout the ovarian medulla and cortex except oocytes (Fig. 4F). In the testis, low level of DAN expression was observed in the testicular cord (Fig. 4C). Brk3 expression was limited to somatic cells of testicular cords (Fig. 4B,E).Expression of Bmp‐related genes in the later developmental stage. Expression of Bmp7 (A,D), Brk3 (B,E) and DAN (C,F) genes and localization of CVH (brown) in the left male testis (A–C) and left female ovary (D–F) of day 15. Bar, 200 µm.To investigate the relation of mRNA expression of Bmp‐related genes to the gonadogenesis and sex differentiation in the chicken embryo, we examined the effect of AI and female to male sex reversal on the gonadal expression of these genes by in situ hybridization. Embryos were subjected to injection of AI on day 3 and gonads were removed and examined on day 8. In total, six embryos (four females and two males) were treated with AI and gave similar results.In genetic males, AI treatment showed no significant effect on testicular differentiation, whereas in genetic females, the right gonad became a testis and the left gonad a testis or ovotestis, as was reported previously (Nishikimi et al. 2000; Vaillant et al. 2001a,b).Ad4BP/SF‐1 is an activator of the expression of enzymes involved in steroidogenesis, in particular P450arom (Lynch et al. 1993), and its expression is maintained in the female chicken gonad. In the control female, Ad4BP/SF‐1 mRNA was located in the medullar part of the gonads, whereas in the embryo that received AI, cells in the testicular‐like cords weakly expressed Ad4BP/SF‐1 (Fig. 5B.G).Expression of Bmp‐related genes in gonads of aromatase inhibitor (AI)‐treated chicken embryos. Expression of P450arom (A,F), Ad4BP (B,G), Bmp7 (C,H), Brk3 (D,I) and DAN (E,J) in gonads of control (A–E) and AI‐treated (F–J) female chicken embryos. Transverse sections of the left and right gonads are shown in each photograph. Arrows in (F) indicate weak expression of P450arom. L, left; R, right. Bar, 100 µm.P450arom, which converts androstendione to estradiol‐17β, is detected in both left and right gonads only in the female embryo on day 7 and its expression continues until after birth (Nakabayashi et al. 1998; Oréal et al. 2002). In control females, specific P450arom mRNA signals were observed in the medullar cords of the gonad, but were not found in the gonadal germinal epithelium or cortical cord. In the AI‐treated females, only weak signals were found in both left and right gonads (Fig. 5A,F). These expression patterns of Ad4BP/SF‐1 and P450arom indicate that AI effectively reversed the sex of female gonads.Bmp7 and DAN mRNAs showed female‐specific expression and their enriched expression in the gonads was seen after sexual differentiation at day 8 (Fig. 5C,E), as stated above. However, no specific Bmp7 mRNA was detected in any region of the AI‐treated female gonads (Fig. 5H). DAN expression was detected in AI‐treated female although somewhat more weakly than in the normal female (Fig. 5E,J).Brk3 is normally expressed only in male gonads on day 8. Stronger Brk3 expression was detectable in AI‐treated female than in control female (Fig. 5D,I).In this study, to investigate possible involvement of BMP signaling in avian gonad development, we examined mRNA expression of Bmps, Bmp receptors and Bmp antagonists in the embryonic gonads by in situ hybridization. Also, we studied the effect of aromatase inhibitor on expression of these genes in the gonad.Our study demonstrated that in sex‐indifferent gonads of both sexes, Bmp7 was asymmetrically expressed in the left gonadal epithelium at the beginning of genital ridge formation from day 3.5 to day 4.5 embryos (Fig. 2A–C). Bmp7 was initially expressed in the lateral region of the presumptive gonadal epithelium (Fig. 2A) and gradually expanded medially to the gonadal epithelium region into which PGC have reached (Fig. 2B–C). At these periods of development, volume and surface epithelium thickness are greater in the left gonad in both sexes and the number of PGC migrating along the dorsal mesentery into the presumptive gonadal epithelial region is greater in the left gonad than in the right (Van Limborgh 1968). Until now, little was known about the molecular mechanism leading to the L‐R asymmetric development of gonads at these early periods. Left gonadal epithelium‐specific expression of Bmp7 may be involved in the establishment of this asymmetry.Nodal is a member of the TGF‐β superfamily and is expressed in the left lateral plate mesoderm (LPM). It is considered to be a left determinant because its expression is sufficient to control laterality (Levin et al. 1997; Lowe et al. 2001). Identified target genes of Nodal are the transcription factors Pitx2 and Nkx3.2, both implicated in the control of organ laterality. Bmp and Bmp antagonists are also asymmetrically expressed in the LPM at the early somite stage in the chicken embryo as a result of interaction with Nodal signaling (Piedra & Ros 2002). Thus, L‐R asymmetric Bmp7 expression in early gonadal anlage may also be regulated by the Nodal signaling pathway.On day 5, gonadal epithelium is starting to invade the gonadal mesenchyme to form first sexual cords. At this stage, the expression site of Bmp7 changed rapidly from the gonadal epithelium to the mesenchyme, and expressions of Bmp7, Brk3 and DAN were now co‐localized in the mesenchyme of the gonad. This may indicate that BMP7 signaling and coordinately expressed Bmp antagonists work together as reciprocal regulators in epithelial–mesenchymal interactions. To determine whether Bmp signalling is a direct morphological factor in the gonad development at this stage, it is necessary to carry out functional analysis of each factor, investigated here.The results obtained in this study demonstrated an ovary‐specific Bmp7 expression in the chicken embryonic gonads from day 8 when sexual difference between ovary and testis becomes apparent (Fig. 3A,D). DAN was expressed in the ovary (Fig. 3F) and BRK‐3 in the testicular cord but not in the ovary (Fig. 3B,E). These three genes might therefore be new ovary and testis biomarkers in the chicken embryos. Although we could not detect ovary‐specific ligand‐receptor pair of BMP signaling, the activin type 1 and type 2 receptors, which can transduce BMP7 signals as BMP receptors, may be expressed in the ovary of chicken embryos.Several key regulators of gonadal development and male sex differentiation are known in mammals. Sry acts as the initial switch to trigger male development. Sox9 is an another early master regulator of male development. Dax1 and Wnt4 are abundantly expressed in early ovarian development but transgenic and knockout analyses indicate a more important role for these factors in repressing the male pattern of development. However, active regulators of early ovarian development have not been well characterized (Smith & Sinclair 2004).Essentially, the chicken embryo resembles lower vertebrate members in that estrogens play a central role in gonadogenesis. Thus, the injection of AI causes suppression of female‐specific P450arom mRNA expression (Nishikimi et al. 2000). The present study confirmed this. We reported here that, following treatment with AI prior to morphological sexual differentiation, expression of DAN was downregulated in the AI‐treated gonads. In addition, female‐specific Bmp7 expression was not detected in AI‐treated gonad, whereas expression of Brk3 specific to Sertoli cells in the control gonad was upregulated in the testicular‐cord‐like structures in the AI‐treated genetic female gonad. These results suggest that expression of Bmp and Bmp‐related genes in gonad after sex differentiation is regulated by estrogen‐mediated hormonal conditions.In conclusion, the present study demonstrated for the first time the sex‐specific and L‐R‐specific expression of Bmp7 and sex‐dependent expression of Bmp‐related genes in the embryonic chicken gonad, and dynamic changes of expression pattern of Bmp7 in the gonad after AI treatment. BMP signaling system may play an important role for determination of L‐R asymmetric development or sex differentiation in the gonadogenesis in the chicken embryo.We thank Dr Hidetosi Saiga and Dr Kimiko Fukuda for helpful discussion.

H.Volume47, Issue2February 2005Pages 65-74Hint is a universally conserved, dimeric AMP-lysine hydrolase encoded on the avian Z chromosome. Tandemly repeated on the female-specific W chromosome, Asw encodes a potentially sex-determining, dominant-negative Hint dimerization partner whose substrate-interacting residues were specifically altered in evolution. To test the hypothesis that Gln127 of Asw is responsible for depression and/or alteration of Hint enzyme activity, a corresponding mutant was created in the chicken Hint homodimer, and a novel substrate was developed that links reversal of AMP-lysine modification to aminomethylcoumarin release. Strikingly, the Hint-W123Q substitution reduced kcat/Km for AMP-lysine hydrolysis 17-fold, while it increased specificity for AMP-para-nitroaniline hydrolysis by 160-fold. The resulting 2,700-fold switch in enzyme specificity suggests that Gln127 could be the dominant component of Asw dominant negativity in avian feminization.hint is a homodimer of ∼14 kDa subunits that functions as an AMP-lysine hydrolase and positive regulator of Kin28 in yeast, whose most conserved amino acids form the dimer interface and the substrate binding site (2, 3, 8). The Hint active site consists of mostly nonpolar residues that contribute to adenosine binding (3), the histidine that forms a phosphoramide with the substrate α-phosphate (11), Ser107, which interacts with the leaving group amine (8), and Trp123, which interacts with the alkyl portion of the lysine leaving group across the dimer interface (8).Although it is known that male birds are homogametic with a ZZ karyotype and females are heterogametic with a ZW karyotype, the molecular basis for sexual differentiation is unknown, although the existence of a ZZW female warbler strongly suggests that genetic information on the W chromosome is responsible for feminization (1). In birds other than ostriches and emus, the female-specific W chromosome carries ∼40 tandem repeats of an unusual Hint-related gene, ASW, whereas the Z chromosome carries a typical HINT gene (7, 12). In a striking departure from all previously isolated Hint homologous sequences, which conserve the AMP-lysine binding site more than other residues, the female-specific Asw protein has strong similarity to Hint except that 15 of 16 substrate-interacting residues are sexually dimorphic, i.e., altered in the W-encoded Asw with respect to the Z-encoded Hint (13). Thus, because the predicted dimerization interface (helix α2 and beta strand β4) is virtually unaltered in Asw (13), and a single His-to-Ala substitution can reduce the catalytic activity of Hint by over 100,000-fold (2), evolutionary pressures may have ablated the AMP-lysine binding site in Asw but allowed Asw to function as a Hint heterodimerization partner. In this regard, it is important to note that of the 16 substrate-interacting residues in the Hint dimer, only one interacts with the AMP-lysine substrate across the dimer interface (8). That residue, Trp123, in the COOH-terminal Trp-Pro-Pro-Gly motif of Hint, is conspicuously substituted by Gln in the repeated, female-specific Asw sequence (13).As a candidate female sex-determining gene, we reasoned that dominance and negativity might be functionally separable components of Asw’s activities. Negativity would seem to be a function of loss of AMP-binding residues in the Asw sequence, but, because the Hint dimer is not cooperative with respect to substrate hydrolysis (2), an inert dimerization partner would fail to depress Hint enzymatic activity by more than 50%. In fact, because there is no HINT gene on the W chromosome, HINT gene dosage is already reduced 50% by HINT gene absence. We therefore considered an explanation necessary for why a potential Hint dimerization partner lacking an active site is repeated 40 times on the W chromosome. By constructing a model of the putative Hint-Asw heterodimer based on crystal structures of rabbit Hint bound to products (3) and substrate analogs (8), we noted that Hint Trp123 is expected to be located on the Asw side of the dimer interface (13). More importantly, the model predicted that the residue in Asw that corresponds to Hint Trp123, namely Gln127, is physically located in the Hint half of the putative heterodimer. Thus we proposed that Gln127 in place of Trp123 is responsible for dominant depression and/or dominant alteration of activity of the Hint active site (13). In this study, with site-directed mutagenesis of chicken Hint and synthesis of a novel fluorescent Hint substrate, we establish that the W123Q allele of Hint creates a 2,700-fold alteration of substrate specificity, supporting a mechanistic role for Asw’s COOH-terminal Gln in feminization of developing birds.To study the AMP-lysine hydrolase activity of wild-type chicken Hint and the Hint-W123Q mutant, we modified a fluorigenic trypsin substrate [tert-butoxycarbonyl-l-lysine methylcoumarinamide (tBoc-Lys-MCA)] by adenylylation of the ε-amino group of lysine (tBoc-LysAMP-MCA, Fig. 1). Because this modification renders the lysinamide moiety resistant to trypsin, Hint incubations to liberate tBoc-Lys-MCA are coupled to tryptic digestion to quantitate Hint activity with aminomethylcoumarin (AMC) release from tBoc-Lys (see Supplemental Materials, are available online at the Physiological Genomics web site).11The Supplemental Material for this article (Supplemental Methods and Figs. S1–S3) is available online at http://physiolgenomics.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/00204.2004/DC1.Fig. 1.
Structure and synthesis of tBoc-LysAMP-MCA. Because the ε-adenylyl modification of Lys blocks trypsin cleavage, Hint enzymatic activity is limiting for production of tert-butoxycarbonyl-l-lysine methylcoumarinamide (tBoc-Lys-MCA), a trypsin substrate (see Supplemental Material, at the Physiological Genomics web site). tBoc-LysAMP-MCA was made as a modification of the adenosine 5′-phosphoramidate synthesis method of Fu et al. (4). Under an argon atmosphere at room temperature, 0.25 mmol of tBoc-Lys-MCA (Bachem) and 0.12 mmol ADP (Sigma) were dissolved in 2 ml pyridine plus 0.6 ml trimethylsilyl chloride, added dropwise, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 2 days. The mixture was evaporated, and 1 ml of 2 M aqueous ammonia was added to hydrolyze the residue. Product was extracted with four 5-ml volumes of diethyl ether, evaporated to dryness, and dissolved in 1.5 ml isopropanol:2 M aqueous ammonia:methanol (7:1:2). tBoc-LysAMP-MCA (yield = 20.6%) was purified twice by silica gel column chromatography using a 10 × 1 cm column. Peak material was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). MALDI was performed on an Applied Biosystems Voyager system 6235 in negative ion mode using 3-hydroxypicolinic acid (observed mass = 733.79; calculated mass = 734.26). 31P, 13C, and 1H-NMR data were collected using a 15-mm probe with the compound in DMSO. 1H-NMR (500 mHz, DMSO-d6, 50°C) δ = 10.93 (s, 1H), 10.85 (s, 1H), 8.47 (s, 1H), 8.12 (s, 1H), 7.81 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 1H), 7.71 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 1H), 7.53 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 1H), 7.35–7.44 (m, 2H), 7.27 (d, J = 7.6 Hz, 1H), 7.10–7.16 (m, 1H), 6.25 (d, J = 1.2 Hz, 1H), 5.89 (d, J = 5.4 Hz, 1H), 5.57–5.62 (m, 1H), 4.55–4.59 (m, 1H), 4.18–4.21 (m, 1H), 4.07–4.21 (m, 1H), 4.02–4.05 (m, 1H), 3.83–3.88 (m, 1H), 3.74–3.80 (m, 1H), 2.72–2.77 (m, 1H), 2.66–2.70 (m, 1H), 2.36 (d, J = 4.2 Hz, 3H), 1.64–1.70 (m, 1H), 1.57–1.61 (m, 1H), 1.33 (d, J = 13.9 Hz, 9H), 1.23–1.25 (m, 1H), 1.00 (d, J = 6.1 Hz, 3H); 13C-NMR (hmqc, DMSO-d6, 50°C, partial) δ = 153.3, 126.5, 116.0, 112.7, 106.2, 87.5, 84.4, 74.5, 71.3, 64.3, 41.5, 40.3, 31.6, 28.8, 28.6, 28.1, 26.0, 18.6; 31P-NMR (300 mHz, DMSO-d6) δ = 2.66.Fig. 2.
The 2,700-fold alteration of substrate specificity by W123Q alteration. The chicken Hint cDNA was amplified from EST clone pat.pk0069.a10 from the University of Delaware using primers 7038 (5′ GATCGTCCATATGGCTGACGAGATCCGCAAGG) and 7039 (5′ CACTCTCGAGTTAGCCAGGAGGCCAGCCCAACTG) and cloned into pSGA02 as an NdeI-XhoI fragment. The W123Q substitution was introduced (9) with mutagenic primer 7046 (5′ GGTCGTCAGTTGGGCCAGCCTCCTGGCTAA). Enzymes were purified as described (2, 8). tBoc-LysAMP-MCA assays, at 5–50 μM, described and validated in detail in Supplementary Materials, were performed with 1.8 fmol of wild-type or 19 fmol Hint-W123Q at pH 5.5 with 1 mM EDTA. Reactions (10–20 min) were stopped by adjusting the pH to 9.5, addition of trypsin to a final concentration of 60 μg/μl to liberate aminomethylcoumarin (AMC), then quantitated by fluorescence. AMP-para-nitroaniline (AMP-pNA) assays with 3.6 pmol wild-type or 0.36 pmol Hint-W123Q were as described (8). Solid symbols are on the lefty-axis. Open symbols are on the righty-axis.Conversion of Hint dimers to Asw-Hint heterodimers could either depress AMP-lysine hydrolytic activity, promote another activity, or both. To test whether substitution of Trp123, which makes a hydrophobic interaction with the Lys leaving group of AMP-lysine in the substrate across the dimer interface (8), would promote hydrolysis of a bulkier adenylylated phosphoramide substrate, we tested wild-type and W123Q forms of chicken Hint on AMP-para-nitroaniline (AMP-pNA) (8). This molecule, which is followed spectroscopically, is a poor substrate for wild-type rabbit Hint (8). In the chicken system, the wild-type kcat was depressed 470-fold (to 0.051 s−1) and Km was elevated 15-fold (to 93 μM), for an overall specificity constant of 550 M−1s−1 with AMP-pNA. Remarkably, Hint-W123Q is 160-fold superior AMP-pNA hydrolase compared with wild-type Hint (kcat = 1.1 s−1; Km = 13 μM; kcat/Km = 88,000 M−1s−1). The 17-fold depressed AMP-lysine hydrolase activity coupled with 160-fold superior AMP-pNA hydrolase activity represents a 2,700-fold alteration of specificity, which is remarkable for a single amino acid substitution.Although sex-specific body plans are fundamentally similar in all vertebrate phyla, birds and mammals make use of unique chromosomal sex determination systems while crocodiles, many turtles and some lizards lack genetically encoded switches and make use of environmental sex determination (5). Thus it has been argued that genetic switches have evolved independently in birds and mammals that take the place of temperature-dependent switches in organisms without sex chromosomes. Because Asw is repeated 40 times on the female-specific W chromosome and is highly expressed at the urogenital ridge precisely at the time of feminization (7, 12), we have considered Asw to be a strong candidate gene for female sex determination (13). The ability of Asw residue 127 to repress and alter Hint enzymatic activity is a plausible mechanism for function of Asw in this process; either of these activities might be sufficient for Asw function. Because functions of Hint that depend on protein-protein interactions have been proposed (10), one could hypothesize that Asw functions by altering putative Hint complexes or promoting a female-specific complex. However, as a Hint active site mutant is a functional null (2), it was interesting to determine whether an Asw residue could repress Hint enzymatic activity in trans.This study is also instructive in dissection of how nature constructs a dominant-negative allele. As described by Ira Herskowitz (6), a dominant-negative allele ought to have two characteristics: simple loss of function and dominant interference. In the case of Asw, loss of function can be attributed to mutation of the active-site residues (13), which is sufficient to produce an inactive allele in vitro and in vivo (2). Because overexpression of an inert molecule would be pointless, however, we searched for the source of dominant interference in Asw. Transplantation of the dimer-crossing Trp to Gln substitution of Asw into the Hint sequence both depressed and altered specificity, consistent with a dominant-negative mechanism for Asw function in avian feminization.This work was supported by National Cancer Institute Grant CA-75954 to C.

It contains 913 nucleotides with an open reading frame encoding 146 amino acids with a 20 amino acid signal peptide. The grouper mature TSHβ has 75, 70, 61, 59, 41, 42 and 40% identities to that of rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon, zebrafish, European eel, chicken, mouse and human, respectively. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the TSHβ mRNA was expressed abundantly not only in pituitary but also in gonads. A more interesting finding is to reveal the differential TSHβ expressions between the ovaries and the transitional gonads or testes in natural individuals of orange-spotted grouper and red-spotted grouper Epinephelus akaara, and in artificial sex reversal individuals of red-spotted grouper induced by MT feeding. In situ hybridization localization provided direct evidence that the TSHβ was transcribed in the germ cells. In the growing oocytes, the TSHβ transcripts were concentrated on the ooplasm periphery. In testicular tissues, the intensively expressed TSHβ cells were found to be spermatogonia and spermatocytes in the spermatogenic cysts. This is the first report of a TSHβ expressed in the gonads of any vertebrates in addition to the expected expression in the pituitary, and it expresses more transcripts in the gonads during sex reversal or testis than in the ovaries both in E. coioides and E. akaara. Importantly, the TSHβ identification in germ cells allows us to further investigate the functional roles and the molecular mechanisms in gametogenesis of groupers, especially in sex reversal and in spermatogenesis.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Although putative ligands for these orphan members remain to be identified, some of these receptors possess intrinsic activating, inhibitory, or dual regulatory functions in development, differentiation, homeostasis, and reproduction. In particular, gene-silencing events elicited by chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors (COUP-TFs); dosage-sensitive sex reversal-adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1 (DAX-1); germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF); short heterodimer partner (SHP); and testicular receptors 2 and 4 (TR2 and TR4) are among the best characterized. These orphan receptors are critical in controlling basal activities or hormonal responsiveness of numerous target genes. They employ multiple and distinct mechanisms to mediate target gene repression. Complex cross-talk exists between these orphan receptors at their cognate DNA binding elements and an array of steroid⧸nonsteroid hormone receptors, other transcriptional activators, coactivators and corepressors, histone modification enzyme complexes, and components of basal transcriptional components. Therefore, perturbation induced by these orphan receptors at multiple levels, including DNA binding activities, receptor homo- or heterodimerization, recruitment of cofactor proteins, communication with general transcriptional machinery, and changes at histone acetylation status and chromatin structures, may contribute to silencing of target gene expression in a specific promoter or cell-type context. Moreover, the findings derived from gene-targeting studies have demonstrated the significance of these orphan receptors' function in physiologic settings. Thus, COUP-TFs, DAX-1, GCNF, SHP, and TR2 and 4 are known to be required for multiple physiologic and biologic functions, including neurogenesis and development of the heart and vascular system steroidogenesis and sex determination, gametogenesis and embryonic development, and cholesterol⧸lipid homeostasis.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Eggs were injected with 1 mg Fadrozole on day 4 of incubation. In females having developed sex‐reversed gonads, endocrine parameters (estradiol and testosterone) at and after 13 weeks of age were indicative of the degree of sex reversal, with, for example, sex‐reversed females with two testes having the highest levels of testosterone and the lowest levels of estradiol. Among these females, eight (from a total of 13) produced ejaculates with scarce and abnormal spermatozoa. Some motility was observable in the ejaculates from five of them. None of the post‐hatch treatments had a significant effect on plasma levels of testosterone or estradiol (measured at 3‐week intervals from week 4 to week 28 post‐hatch) or on gonadal aromatase activity (measured at 12 and 28 weeks). In conclusion, these results indicate that plasma levels of testosterone and estradiol at and after 13 weeks of age are valuable indicators of the degree of sex reversal in female chickens treated with Fadrozole prior to gonadal sex differentiation. In pre‐cited conditions, post‐natal treatments with either Fadrozole or Fadrozole + testosterone had no apparent effect on the degree of sex reversal in these birds. Finally, the occurrence of ejaculates with motile although scarce and abnormal spermatozoa, revealed that epididymes and ducti deferens can develop and become functional in sex‐reversed female chickens.

Dev. 65: 420–428, 2003. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.Volume65, Issue4August 2003Pages 420-428Copyright © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.Sex in birds is chomosomally based (ZZ male, ZW female), but the mechanism underlying sex determination remains unknown. An unresolved question is whether Z gene dosage plays a role in avian sex determination. DMRT1 is an avian Z-linked gene that shows higher expression in male gonads during embryogenesis and has been proposed as a putative testis-determining gene in birds. The Z-linkage of this gene makes it an ideal candidate for testing the question of gene dosage in avian testis determination. A higher level of DMRT1 expression in male (ZZ) versus female (ZW) embryonic gonads may reflect the presence of two Z-linked copies in the male, or it may be due to specific and active upregulation of DMRT1 during testis formation. A functional interventionist strategy was used to distinguish between these two possibilities. DMRT1 expression was analyzed in chicken embryos during experimentally induced female-to-male sex reversal, using the aromatase enzyme inhibitor fadrozole. DMRT1 expression was analyzed by whole mount in situ hybridization and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (for mRNA) and indirect immunofluorescence (for protein). Female-to-male sex-reversed embryos (genetically ZW) showed elevated levels of DMRT1 expression similar to those of normal males (with two copies of the Z chromosome). Elevated levels of DMRT1 are therefore associated with testis development, both in normal males (ZZ) and in sex-reversed females (ZW). SOX9 expression was also activated during female-to-male sex reversal but appeared delayed relative to DMRT1 upregulation. These results show that testis development does not require two Z-linked copies of DMRT1, but it does involve active upregulation of the gene. Higher levels of DMRT1 expression during testis differentiation therefore do not simply reflect a gene dosage difference between the two sexes but imply active involvement in male development.Gonadal development in vertebrate embryos involves the differentiation and organization of several different cell types into either an ovary or a testis. The same cell lineages are initially present in the undifferentiated (bipotential) gonads of both sexes, but their fates differ depending upon the expression of sex-determining genes. In male mammals, the Y-chromosome-linked SRY gene directs differentiation of the supporting cell lineage into Sertoli cells. These cells become organized into seminiferous cords and enclose mitotically arrested germ cells. Sertoli cell differentiation is the pivotal event in mammalian testis formation. These cells are thought to signal the organization of seminiferous cords and the differentiation of androgen-producing Leydig cells around the cords [1]. In female (XX) embryos, the supporting cell lineage gives rise to granulosa cells, folliculogenesis occurs, and an ovary differentiates. The trigger for female sex determination remains unknown, although recent data implicate the WNT4 signaling pathway [2].Although gonadal sex differentiation in birds closely resembles that in mammals, the sex-determining mechanism differs. In birds, the heterogametic sex is female (designated ZW), and the homogametic sex is male (designated ZZ). The sex chromosomes of birds are not homologous to those of mammals, and no SRY gene has been identified (reviewed in [3]). At present, the mechanism of avian sex determination remains unknown. It may involve a dominant ovary-determining gene carried on the W sex chromosome, or it may depend upon Z-chromosome dosage (one dose for female, two for male) [3]. A third possibility is that both mechanisms operate [4]. It was originally suggested that no dosage compensation of sex (Z)-linked genes occurs in birds [5]. However, results of recent studies of a larger number of Z-linked genes indicate that expression equalization between the sexes does occur for many genes [6]. If so, such dosage compensation appears not to depend upon Z-chromosome inactivation in males, because transcription has been observed from both Z chromosomes [7]. Compensation may therefore involve greater mRNA synthesis from the single Z-linked genes in females [8] or on posttranslational equalization. The issue of dosage compensation in birds is particularly relevant to sex determination. In the absence of compensation, a dosage-based sex-determining system is favored, whereby two doses of a gene product in ZZ embryos induce male development and one dose induces female development.The chicken Z-linked gene, doublesex and Mab-3-related transcription factor 1 (DMRT1) has received considerable attention recently as a candidate testis-determining factor in birds [9–11]. DMRT1 belongs to a family of known or putative transcription factors sharing a conserved DNA-binding motif, the DM domain [12]. DMRT1 is conserved across vertebrates and is expressed in the embryonic gonads of fishes, reptiles, birds, and mammals [10, 13–15]. In all of these groups, expression is higher in developing male than in developing female gonads. Chicken DMRT1 (cDMRT1) is expressed exclusively in the embryonic urogenital system. Expression is higher in male (ZZ) gonads than in female (ZW) gonads prior to and throughout the period of gonadal sex differentiation [14]. Its location on the Z sex chromosome and its sexually dimorphic expression profile make DMRT1 a strong candidate testis-determining gene in the chicken embryo.However, a role for DMRT1 in chicken gonadal development has not yet been demonstrated. The higher level of DMRT1 expression in ZZ embryos may be necessary for testis formation. Alternatively, because DMRT1 is located on the Z sex chromosome, its higher expression may reflect a lack of dosage compensation for this gene, and its sexual dimorphism may be unrelated to sex determination. A potential role for DMRT1 in chicken testis differentiation can be clarified by inducing experimental sex reversal, which is achieved in birds by blocking estrogen synthesis. Estrogen production is critical for ovarian differentiation in birds and other nonmammalian vertebrates [16]. The estrogen-synthesising enzyme P450 aromatase is expressed in female but not male gonads at the onset of gonadal sex differentiation [17, 18], and the administration of aromatase inhibitors results in testis differentiation in genetic females [19–21]. Conversely, administration of estrogen to genetic males causes transient feminization of the gonads [16]. In the present study, we examined the effects of aromatase inhibition and female-to-male sex reversal on the gonadal expression of DMRT1 at both the mRNA and protein levels. If DMRT1 plays an active role in testis differentiation, requiring higher expression in the male than in the female, then its expression is predicted to increase during female-to-male sex reversal despite the presence of only one Z chromosome. However, if higher expression in normal males simply reflects the presence of two Z chromosomes, then expression during female-to-male sex reversal should remain unchanged. Our results indicate that DMRT1 is upregulated during female-to-male sex reversal in ZW embryos, supporting an active role for this gene in chicken testis differentiation. In contrast, another candidate testis-regulatory gene, SOX9, shows delayed activation in sex-reversed embryos, suggesting that it may lie downstream in the avian sex-determination pathway.Fertile chicken (Gallus domesticus) eggs were obtained from a commercial supplier and incubated under humid conditions at 37.8°C. On Day 4 of incubation (Hamburger and Hamilton stage 24) [22], eggs were treated with a single injection of fadrozole, a specific nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI) (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland). The fadrozole was dissolved in PBS at a concentration of 10 mg/ml, and 0.1 ml (1 mg) was injected into the albumen at the pointed end of each egg. Controls were treated with 0.1 ml of PBS alone. Holes were sealed with tape, and incubation was allowed to proceed. Paired urogenital systems were then harvested from embryos at stage 29/30 (Day 6–6.5), stage 32 (Day 7–7.5), stage 34/35 (Day 8–8.5), and stage 36 (Day 10.5). For some experiments, Day 14.5 (stage 40) embryos were also harvested. In the chicken embryo, the onset of gonadal sex differentiation is first apparent histologically at stage 30 (Day 6.5). Tissues were fixed and processed for either whole mount in situ hybridization or tissue section immunoflourescence. Some specimens were fixed in Bouin solution, embedded in paraffin, and processed for standard hematoxylin and eosin staining or immunohistochemical detection of aromatase protein.All embryos were sexed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a W-linked (female-specific) XhoI repeat sequence. At the time of dissection, a small piece of limb tissue was taken for sexing. Tissues were digested in 50 μl of PCR-compatible buffer at 55°C for 1 h [23] and then heated to 95°C for 10 min, and 3 μl was taken for PCR amplification. PCR was carried out using W-linked (female-specific) XhoI primers as described previously [17], except that chicken glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) rather than β-actin primers were used as internal controls. The GAPDH primers were cGAPDH/1 (5′ CAG-ATC-AGT-TTC-TAT-CAG-C 3′) and cGAPDH/2 (5′ TGT-GAC-TTC-AAT-GGT-GAC-A 3′), amplifying a 600-base pair (bp) genomic fragment. Both primer pairs were included in a duplex reaction. By this rapid sexing method, only ZW (female) embryos showed amplification of the XhoI fragment.Gonadal cDMRT1 transcripts were detected in control and AI-treated embryos using a sensitive whole mount in situ hybridization protocol. Urogenital systems were dissected from embryos at various time points following treatment and were fixed overnight at 4°C in 4% paraformaldehyde in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated PBS. Tissues were pooled by sex and divided into groups for whole mount analysis of DMRT1 and SOX9 mRNA expression. Chicken SOX9 (cSOX9) is only expressed in male gonads at the onset of testicular differentiation on Day 6.5 [24, 25]. Whole mount in situ hybridization was carried out as described previously [26]. Tissues were dehydrated through graded methanols, rehydrated into PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, permeablized with proteinase K (10 μg/ml), washed, and placed in prehybridization solution overnight at 65°C. Digoxygenin (DIG)-labeled antisense and sense cRNA probes were synthesized from cloned cDNA templates using a DIG-labeling kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). For cDMRT1, a specific 366-bp fragment downstream of the DM domain was used. For cSOX9, a 388-bp fragment from the 3′ untranslated region was used. These probes were the same as those used previously to detect cDMRT1 and cSOX9 mRNA by whole mount in situ hybridization [14, 24]. Following overnight hybridization at 65°C, tissues were washed in 2× saline-sodium citrate (SSC)/0.5% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) at 65°C and then in 0.2× SSC/0.5% CHAPS at 65°C, blocked, and incubated overnight in alkaline phosphatase-conjugated DIG antibody (Roche). Tissues were then extensively washed in Tris-Triton X-100 buffer prior to incubation in 5-bromocresyl-3-indolylphosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium chromogen. All tissues were left in chromogen solution for the same length of time (3 h) and photographed under the same conditions. At least four urogenital systems were used for each treatment at each time point.DMRT1 gene expression was examined by relative quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RQ RT-PCR), using SYBR Green detection and real time PCR. Fertile eggs were treated with fadrozole or PBS control on Day 3 as described above, and gonadal pairs were harvested on Days 6, 7, 8, and 10. Embryos were sexed by PCR and pooled by sex (five to eight gonadal pairs per treatment). Total RNA was extracted from the pooled samples using the guanidinium thiocynate method, and reverse transcription (RT) was carried out using random hexamers plus oligo d(T)16 primers in the presence of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (42°C for 30 min). To control for genomic DNA contamination, some samples were included that lacked reverse transcriptase. Successful RT was confirmed for all samples by then carrying out PCR amplification of the housekeeping gene, GAPDH. GAPDH cDNA bands were seen in all samples except for the RT-negative controls.Specific DMRT1 cDNA amplification was then carried out on duplicate samples using Taq DNA polymerase and SYBR Green I Mastermix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). SYBR Green dye binds nonspecifically to double-stranded DNA. DMRT1 primers were designed such that one spanned the junction of two exons, giving a single cDNA PCR product and precluding amplification of genomic DNA. Similarly, specific chicken β-actin PCR primers were designed for use as normalization controls. In pilot experiments using these primer pairs, single DMRT1 and β-actin cDNA PCR products were obtained, as confirmed by sequence analysis. Real time PCR was carried out in an Prism 7700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) at a 60°C annealing temperature for 40 cycles according to the manufacturer's recommendations. During PCR, fluorescence accumulation resulting from DNA amplification was recorded using the Sequence Detector software (Applied Biosystems). PCR products were resolved on an agarose gel to confirm amplification. No PCR products were seen in the RT- or water control lanes. Cycle threshold (CT) values were obtained from the exponential phase of PCR amplification, and DMRT1 expression was corrected against β-actin expression, generating a ΔCT value (ΔCT = DMRT1 CT − β-actin CT). Relative expression was then expressed according to the equation 2−ΔCT.Polyclonal anti-chicken cDMRT1 and aromatase antibodies were raised in rabbits using 16-amino acid peptides as antigens conjugated to diphtheria toxoid (synthesized by Mimotopes, Clayton, Australia). For DMRT1, the peptide CPSIPSRGHLESTSDL was used (the cysteine at the N terminus is nonnative, for conjugation). This peptide is outside the conserved DM domain and was predicted by computer modeling to lie at the surface of the protein (Mimotopes). For chicken aromatase, a sequence at the C terminus, CEMVFTPRSPNKNQSD, was used. This antibody was raised to monitor aromatase protein expression in normal and AI-treated embryos, using immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded sections with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Previous studies indicated that AI treatment leads to dramatic reduction in aromatase expression [21, 27]. For each peptide, one rabbit was immunized. An ELISA of serum revealed a strong immune response, and the antibodies were purified by protein A sepharose chromatography.Western blot analysis was carried out to determine the specificity of the DMRT1 antibody. Mixed-sex embryonic chicken gonads were homogenized in 100 μl of single detergent lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) using a dounce homogenizer. Protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA; Pierce, Rockford, IL). A 12.5- to 50-μg sample of gonad lysate was loaded into each lane with a prestained protein size marker, electrophoresed through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a wet electroblotter. Membranes were blocked in skim milk powder in Tris-buffered saline with Tween (TBST; 5% skim milk powder, 25 mM Tris-HCl, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, and 0.2% Tween 20, pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. After blocking, membranes were incubated with either purified anti-DMRT1 antibody or anti-DMRT1 antibody preadsorbed against 100× molar excess antigen (5 μg/ml) at 4°C for 16 h in 0.5% skim milk powder/TBST solution. Blots were washed and incubated with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit antiserum (1:15 000), and signal was detected using an ECL Plus kit (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) and X-OMAT film (Kodak, Rochester, NY).Frozen sections were used for immunofluorescence. Urogenital systems from control and AI-treated embryos were briefly fixed in 4% PFA (paraformaldehyde)/PBS at room temperature for 10 min and then cryoprotected in 20% sucrose/PBS overnight at 4°C. Tissues were transferred to embedding compound, snap frozen in isopentane precooled in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70°C. Frozen sections (10 μm) were thaw mounted onto silane-treated slides and permeablized in 1% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Following PBS washes, sections were blocked in 1% BSA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibody (1 μg/ml) overnight at 4°C. Sections were washed, incubated with fluorescently labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (ALEXA 488; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), mounted in Fluorosave (Calbiochem, Bad Soden, Germany), and viewed with fluorescence optics. At least three urogenital systems were sectioned for each treatment at each time point. For both cDMRT1 and aromatase, specific staining was abolished following preadsorption of the antibodies with the relevant unconjugated peptide. Staining was also abolished when primary antibody was replaced with preimmune serum.In chicken embryos, the gonads appear as mesodermal thickenings on the ventromedial surface of the mesonephric kidneys at Day 3.5 (stages 21 and 22). The undifferentiated gonads comprise an outer epithelial cell layer (cortex) and underlying medulla. In the medulla, cords of epithelium-like cells (medullary cords) are interspersed with mesenchyme. In both sexes, the germ cells are scattered throughout the gonad but are more concentrated in the cortex. The gonads remain undifferentiated until Day 6.5 (stage 30), when the first histological signs of sexual differentiation become apparent. By Day 10.5 (stage 36), differentiation is advanced. In ZW female embryos examined here, the gonads showed their typical asymmetric development. The left gonad had become a large ovary, characterized by a thickened surface epithelium (cortex) containing proliferating germ and somatic cells (the site of subsequent folliculogenesis). In this left ovary, the medullary cords were thin and elongated, comprising flattened epithelial cells, and were separated by lacunae (luminal spaces; Fig. 1A). The right gonad of female embryos was significantly smaller than the left gonad and did not develop as an ovary. The medulla was lacunar, but the cortex did not develop (Fig. 1B). In ZZ male embryos, bilateral testes were evident by Day 10.5 (stage 36). Sertoli cells had differentiated within the medullary cords, giving rise to seminiferous cords, and the surface epithelium was reduced (Fig. 1F). The interstitium was well developed.Gonads of Day 10.5 (stage 36) control and AI-treated female chicken embryos. A) Left gonad of a control female, showing thickened cortex and underlying medulla, containing thin cords separated by lacunae. C, Cortex; M, medulla. Bar = 100 μm. B) Right gonad of a control female. The cortex is absent, but a lacunar medulla (M) persists. Bar = 100 μm. C) Small, masculinized left gonad of an AI-treated ZW (female) embryo. A cortex is absent, but the medulla (M) has both lacunar female-type cords (arrows) and solid male-type cords (arrowheads). Bar = 100 μm. D) Right testis of an AI-treated ZW (female) embryo, showing male-type seminiferous cords (sc). Bar = 100 μm. E) Higher magnification of the right testis of an AI-treated ZW (female) embryo. Note the reduced epithelium (ep) and well-developed seminiferous cords (sc) containing polarized Sertoli cells. A primordial germ cell (PGC) has become enclosed in one of the cords. Bar = 25 μm. F) Right testis of a control male embryo, showing extensive seminiferous cords (sc). Bar = 100 μmIn comparison to control female gonads, those of AI-treated ZW embryos were strongly masculinized (Fig. 1, C and D). By Day 10.5, the left gonad was significantly smaller than that of PBS-treated control females, and the cortex failed to develop in most individuals (Fig. 1C). The medulla showed poorly organized cords, some with lacunae (female type) and some arranged as seminiferous (male type) cords (Fig. 1C). These left gonads were considered strongly masculinized. The right gonads of AI-treated ZW embryos were more masculinized and were considered testicular. Seminiferous cords were present throughout the medulla, and the cortex was reduced to an epithelial monolayer, as in control males (Fig. 1D). However, fewer seminiferous cords were present than in normal males, and the interstitium was unusually extensive (compare Fig. 1D and Fig. 1F). High magnification of the cords from the right gonads of AI-treated embryos showed histologically recognizable Sertoli cells (highly polarized cells with basal nuclei and apical cytoplasm encircled by basal lamina; Fig. 1E). Germ cells could also be seen within these apparent seminiferous cords (Fig. 1E), as occurs in normal males. Immunohistochemical staining for aromatase protein revealed strong expression in the medullary cords of both left and right control female gonads (Fig. 2, A and B) but dramatically reduced expression in AI-treated females (Fig. 2, C and D). Although there was some variation between individual AI-treated embryos, aromatase protein expression was always more strongly inhibited in the right than in the left gonad. Aromatase was not detected in control or AI-treated male tissues (not shown).Immunohistochemical localization of aromatase protein in the gonads of control and AI-treated Day 10.5 (stage 36) chicken embryos. A) Left gonad of a control female, showing strong expression in the medulla but not in the cortex. B) Right gonad of a control female, showing expression in the medulla. No cortex is present. C) Reduced aromatase expression in the masculinized left gonad of an AI-treated ZW (female) embryo. Some expression is still seen in medullary cords. D) Aromatase protein is almost completely absent in right testis of an AI-treated ZW (female) gonadWhole mount in situ hybridization revealed DMRT1 gene expression in the gonads and Müllerian ducts, with stronger expression in control male gonads than in control female gonads. AI-treated female embryos showed a malelike pattern of DMRT1 expression, i.e., stronger expression than in control females (Fig. 3). The first time point examined after AI treatment on Day 3.5 was Day 6.5 (stage 30), which corresponds to the beginning of aromatase expression in normal females and the onset of morphological sexual differentiation in both sexes. At this time, DMRT1 was expressed in the gonads of both sexes, but expression was higher in male (ZZ) gonads than in both control and AI-treated embryos (not shown). However, at Day 7.5 (stage 32), DMRT1 expression in AI-treated female embryos was clearly stronger than that in control females and was comparable to that of control males (Fig. 3, top panels). At this stage, the pattern of DMRT1 mRNA expression became punctate or granular in the gonads of male and AI-treated embryos. The malelike pattern of DMRT1 expression in AI-treated ZW embryos was maintained up to at least Day 10.5 (stage 36; Fig. 3, bottom panels). At Day 10.5, the gonads of AI-treated embryos were morphologically more similar to those of control males than to those of control females (Fig. 3). In the left and right gonads of both control males and AI-treated females, DMRT1 showed a strong punctate expression pattern. In contrast, a weaker, more diffuse expression pattern was seen in the left ovary and regressing right gonad of control females (Fig. 3, bottom panels). For all of these developmental stages, AI-treated male embryos showed DMRT1 expression that was indistinguishable from that of control (PBS treated) males.DMRT1 mRNA expression in the urogenital systems of control and AI-treated female chicken embryos at Days 7.5 and 10.5. L, Left gonad; R, right gonad. At Day 7.5 (stage 32), strong, punctate expression is seen in the male and female + AI, but expression is lower in control female. The unstained surrounding tissue is embryonic (mesonephric) kidney. At Day 10.5 (stage 36), a large left ovary (Ov) and smaller regressing right gonad (R) show weak, diffuse DMRT1 expression in females. In the left and right gonads of AI-treated ZW embryos, strong punctate expression is seen in the testislike gonads, as in control males. Ts, Testis. Bars = 0.5 mmThe RQ RT-PCR analysis showed that DMRT1 expression was higher in male than in female control gonads from Day 6 to Day 10 (Fig. 4). This sexually dimorphic expression pattern confirmed the results of the whole mount in situ hybridization. The higher level of expression in males represented a >2-fold difference, implying active upregulation in males or downregulation in females. At Day 6, DMRT1 expression in AI-treated ZW females was low and similar to that of control females. However, by Day 7 expression had increased to male levels, a trend that was maintained during subsequent development (Fig. 4). DMRT1 expression in AI-treated male tissues was similar to that of control males at Days 8 and 10 but was actually higher at Days 6 and 7.RQ RT-PCR analysis of cDMRT1 expression in control and AI-treated gonads. Normalized expression is higher in control males than in control females from Day 6 to Day 10. Expression in AI-treated females increased to male levels from Day 7. Expression in AI-treated males is higher than that in normal males at earlier stages but is similar at later stages. Relative expression (×1000) was calculated using the equation 2−ΔCTThe stimulatory effect of fadrozole treatment on DMRT1 expression in ZW embryos was studied in more detail at the protein level, using a specific antibody. The polyclonal chicken DMRT1 antibody raised in rabbit revealed a band of approximtely 34 kDa by Western blotting (Fig. 5A). This band was abolished following preadsoprtion of the antibody with 100× excess antigen (cDMRT1 16-amino acid peptide). Indirect immunofluorescence with this antibody showed staining specifically in embryonic chicken gonads, with stronger staining in males than in females. Specific immunofluorescence was abolished following preadsorption of the antibody with excess antigen (Fig. 5B).Controls for DMRT1 protein analysis. A) Western blot analysis of gonadal protein extracts reveals an approximate 34-kDa band (+Ab), which is abolished following preadsorption with excess DMRT1 peptide (+Pread.Ab). Some larger nonspecific bands were also detectable by Western blot, remaining after antibody preadsorption. B) Immmunofluorescent detection of DMRT1 in a Day 8.5 male gonad (DMRT1 Ab). C) Abolition of specific fluorescence folllowing preadsoprtion with 100× DMRT1 (Ab+ 100×Ag)In embryos examined at Day 6.5 (stage 30), DMRT1 protein was detected by immunofluorescence in the nuclei of the medullary cords in both genetic sexes (Fig. 6, A–C). At this stage, expression was already higher in male gonads than in both control and AI-treated female gonads. This time point corresponds to the onset of gonadal sex differentiation and aromatase expression in normal females [17], and the effects of aromatase inhibition are expected to appear at or after this time. At Day 7.5 (stage 32), DMRT1 protein in AI-treated embryos had become elevated (Fig. 6, F and G). In control females, DMRT1 expression remained low in the medullary cords (Fig. 6, D and E). In contrast, stronger staining for DMRT1 protein was detectable in Sertoli cells organizing into seminiferous cords of control males (Fig. 6H). A similar level of DMRT1 expression and malelike pattern of cord organization was seen in both gonads of AI-treated ZW embryos at this stage (Fig. 6, F and G). This pattern of elevated DMRT1 protein in AI-treated female embryos was maintained at Day 8.5 (stage 34), when the right gonad in particular showed a malelike pattern of cord organization and DMRT1 expression in solid male-type cords (Fig. 6, I–M).Immunofluorescent detection of DMRT1 protein in the gonads of control female and male and AI-treated female chicken embryos. At Day 6.5 (stage 30), control females (A) and AI-treated females (B) have lower levels of DMRT1 protein in the medulla of both left and right gonads (only left is shown). In contrast, higher levels of DMRT1 protein are present in the control male (C). By Day 7.5 (stage 32), DMRT1 is low in female gonads (D and E) but is elevated in females + AI (A and G; arrow). Males continue to show high expression in the organizing seminiferous cords (arrows, H). At Day 8.5 (stage 34), low expression is maintained in left and right female gonads (I and J) but is again higher in females + AI (K and L). In the right AI-treated gonad, the reticulate DMRT1 expression pattern resembles that of the organizing seminiferous cords of males (M, arrow). By Day 10.5 (stage 36), DMRT1 protein is only weakly expressed in females (N and O), with the exception of strong expression in cortical germ cells in the left ovary (N, arrows). Some positive germ cells are also scattered in the medulla of the right gonad (N, arrow). In contrast, strong expression is maintained in the females + AI (P and Q). In the left AI-treated female gonad, expression is visible in the nuclei of solid male-type cords (P, asterisks). In composite cords with lacunae, strong DMRT1 protein expression is visible in thickened areas (P, arrows) but not among flattened cells (P, arrowheads). In the right gonad, strong nuclear expression is visible in developing seminiferous cords (Q, arrow). In control males, DMRT1 protein is localized in the nuclei of Sertoli cells (R, arrows) and in germ cells (R, arrowhead)At Day 10.5 (stage 36), the left and right testes of control males showed strong expression of DMRT1 protein in Sertoli and germ cells within seminiferous cords but not in the interstitium (Fig. 6R). Similarly, in AI-treated females, strong staining for DMRT1 was detectable in the seminiferous cords of both left and right sex-reversed gonads. In the left gonads of these embryos, both male-type (seminiferous) and female-type (lacunar) cords were present (Fig. 6P). The female-type cords with lacunae comprised either flattened or flattened and thickened epithelial cells. Strongly DMRT1-positive cells were observed in the male-type cords and in the thickened but not flattened epithelial cells of the female-type cords (Fig. 6P). In the right testes of AI-treated embryos, virtually all cords were of the male type (solid, lacking lacunae), and all stained strongly for DMRT1 protein (Fig. 6Q). Control female embryos continued to show lower levels of DMRT1 protein in the medulla at Day 10.5 (Fig. 6, N and O). However, strong expression was detectable in the germ cell population at this stage in normal females; in the left gonad, positive germ cells were concentrated in the proliferating gonadal cortex (Fig. 6N), and in the right gonad these cells were occasionally seen scattered through the medulla (Fig. 6O). As in the whole mount studies, AI-treated male embryos showed DMRT1 protein expression that was similar to that of normal control males.Chicken SOX9 is normally expressed only in male gonads at the onset of gonadal sex differentiation (Day 6.5, stage 30). This gene has been considered a candidate testis-determining gene in the chicken embryo. In the embryos studied here, whole mount in situ hybridization analysis showed no detectable expression of SOX9 in control females at any of the days tested (Days 8.5–10.5, stages 34–35; Fig. 7, A and D). In contrast, strong SOX9 expression was first detectable in male gonads at Day 6.5 (stage 30; not shown). Over Days 8.5–10.5, strong expresson was maintained in males (Fig. 7, C and F). In the AI-treated ZW (sex reversed) embryos, SOX9 expression was weakly apparent in the gonads at Day 8.5 (Fig. 7B) and more strongly apparent at Day 10.5 (Fig. 7E). In these embryos, expression appeared stronger in the right gonad, consistent with its greater degree of masculinization.cSOX9 expression in the urogenital system during development in female and male and AI-treated female chicken embryos. No expression is visible in normal females (A and D), but strong expression is evident in males (C and F). Gonads are indicated by arrows. Ts, Testes; Ov, ovary. At Day 8.5, weak expression is first detected in AI-treated females (B) and increases by Day 10.5 (E). Expression is detectable in both left (L) and right (R) gonads of AI-treated females. Bar = 0.5 mmThese data indicate that DMRT1 expression is correlated with testis development in the chicken embryo and that inhibition of aromatase activity allows upregulation of DMRT1 to occur during female-to-male sex reversal. Elevation of DMRT1 expression in sex-reversed ZW female embryos occurs despite the presence of only one Z chromosome. Higher levels of DMRT1 expression can therefore be correlated with testicular differentiation per se and do not solely reflect a lack of dosage compensation for this Z-linked gene. DMRT1 protein is expressed in the nuclei of medullary cord cells (Figs. 5 and 6), which give rise to Sertoli cells and seminiferous cords. Several lines of evidence indicate that testicular morphogenesis in vertebrates begins with and depends upon Sertoli cell differentiation [28–30]. The results described here show a correlation between seminiferous cord formation and elevated DMRT1 expression in normal and sex-reversed chicken gonads.The RQ RT-PCR studies indicated that the higher levels of DMRT1 expression in normal males versus females is unlikely to be attributable to gene dosage differences alone. If it assumed that DMRT1 escapes dosage compensation, males (ZZ) would show twice the level of expression of females (ZW). However, DMRT1 expression in male gonads was >2-fold higher than that in female gonads (Fig. 4). This finding implies active upregulation of gene expression in males, which also occurs in ZW sex-reversed embryos (Fig. 4). Male embryos treated with AI also showed elevated DMRT1 expression at Days 6 and 7 (Fig. 4), although this elevation was less marked at Days 8 and 10. The reasons for this increased expression are unclear, but fadrozole treatment might stimulate DMRT1 expression in males by a mechanism unrelated to aromatase inhibition (aromatase is not expressed in males).In normal chicken embryos, DMRT1 is expressed in the gonads prior to and during the onset of sexual differentiation (from at least as early as Day 4.5, stage 26). At all stages examined, expression is higher in males than in females [10]. In contrast, aromatase gene expression begins at Day 6–6.5 (stages 29 and 30) and is only seen in the medulla of female gonads. In the embryos studied here, DMRT1 expression was similar in control and AI-treated embryos until the normal time of aromatase gene activation (Day 6.5), following which (at Day 7.5) DMRT1 expression became elevated in treated females (Figs. 4 and 6). This finding suggests that the absence of normal aromatase expression at Day 6.5 allowed subsequent upregulation of DMRT1 expression from the single Z chromosome of ZW females. In normal ZW embryos, aromatase gene expression may therefore contribute to the downregulation or inhibition of DMRT1, either directly or indirectly. One of the functions of estrogen synthesis in ZW embryos may be to negatively regulate DMRT1 from Day 6.5, the onset of ovarian development.However, because DMRT1 is already expressed at lower levels in ZW female embryos prior to the onset of aromatase gene expression [14, 31], aromatase/estrogen synthesis cannot be responsible for the initial sexual dimorphism in DMRT1 expression. This dimorphism could be explained by 1) higher expression in males, if not dosage compensated, 2) positive regulation of the DMRT1 locus only in males, or 3) negative regulation of the locus in females. This last alternative implies inhibition by a female-specific (W-linked) factor. The two Z chromosomes are heavily methylated in male chickens, whereas the single Z of females is less methylated [32]. The so-called male hypermethylated region (MHM) is transcribed into high molecular weight noncoding RNA only in females, and this RNA accumulates at the site of transcription very close to the DMRT1 locus. Using triploid (ZZZ and ZZW) chicken cells, Teranishi et al. [32] showed that the W chromosome in females induces hypomethylation of the MHM on the Z chromosome, allowing transcription of the noncoding RNA. By analogy with Xist in mammals, this RNA would inhibit nearby genes (such as DMRT1). A factor on the W chromosome could therefore downregulate DMRT1 in ZW embryos by reducing methylation in the region and allowing inhibitory RNA to bind at the DMRT1 locus. In ZZ embryos, the region would remain hypermethylated, with no RNA transcribed and DMRT1 not inhibited. This process could generate a mechanism whereby DMRT1 is sexually dimorphic between the sexes. The studies reported here suggest that by blocking aromatase, and hence estrogen synthesis, this putative inhibition of DMRT1 is overcome in ZW females. Because no estrogen receptor α (ERα) has been detected in the right gonad [33], this action of estrogen may be mediated in the right gonad by another mechanism.Fadrozole has previously been shown to be a potent and specific inhibitor or aromatase enzyme in embryonic chicken gonads, inducing testicular differentiation and female-to-male sex reversal [19–21, 27, 34] Although fadrozole inhibits the enzyme itself, expression of aromatase protein (Fig. 2) and mRNA [27] are both significantly reduced, which indicates that aromatase gene expression is being blocked. Therefore, estrogen (or a target of estrogen) must be necessary for maintenance of aromatase expression, and inhibition of estrogen synthesis by fadrozole blocks this function. Chicken ERα is expressed in the left but not the right female gonad (at least from Day 7) [26, 33]. However, in the right gonad, aromatase is expressed at this time, and this expression is inhibited by fadrozole [27]. Thus, either estrogen is acting on the aromatase gene in the right gonad via a different receptor (such as ERβ) or it is acting indirectly. Expression of ERβ has not been studied in the chicken embryo.The morphological effects of fadrozole treatment reported here are consistent with previous findings. Vaillant et al. [21, 34] described masculinization of embryonic and post-hatching chicken gonads with fadrozole. They found that medullary cords of AI-treated ZW embryos progressively thickened and differentiated into seminiferous cords, as found here. In addition to seminiferous cords, Vaillant et al. [34] noted two types of lacunar medullary cords in the sex-reversed females: cords with flattened epithelium (typical of females) and composite cords with both flattened and thickened cells. Studying embryos at Day 14, they found that AMH, SF1, and SOX9 were all expressed in the seminiferous cords of AI-treated females and in the thickened but not flattened regions of the composite cords. Although SF1 and AMH are also expressed in normal female gonads, SOX9 expression is only seen in developing male (Sertoli) cells. Vaillant et al. [34] therefore postulated that the composite cords of AI-treated females represented lacunar medullary cords transdifferentiating into (male) seminiferous cords, expressing the Sertoli cell marker SOX9. Such composite medullary cords were also noted in the present study, in addition to male-type seminiferous cords in the left gonads of AI-treated ZW embryos. Strong DMRT1 expression was seen in the thickened but not the flattened cells of composite cords (Fig. 6P). In the right gonads, virtually all cords were male type (seminiferous), and DMRT1 was strongly expressed in the cells of these cords, as in normal males. The results of Vaillant et al. and those of the present study suggest that differentiation of seminiferous cords in ZW embryos involves upregulation of DMRT1 in the medullary cells.Stronger masculinization of the right than of the left gonad of AI-treated embryos can be correlated with the greater degree of aromatase inhibition. Aromatase was more strongly inhibited in the right gonad (see Fig. 2), and residual aromatase expression in the left gonad may account for the less complete and more variable masculinization. Thus, in the left gonad of AI-treated females, some female-type (lacunar) and composite cords were still present. The presence of residual aromatase activity may prevent differentiation of all medullary cords into seminiferous cords. Under this scenario, aromatase expression and estrogen synthesis are correlated with the development of lacunar female-type medullary cords [34], whereas a lack of aromatase and an upregulation of DMRT1 are correlated with the development of male-type (seminiferous) cords. The results reported here and those described previously suggest that aromatase expression in the medullary cords of ZW embryos plays a role in ovarian differentiation, whereas elevated DMRT1 expression in the cords of ZZ embryos is involved in testicular differentiation.In male embryos, DMRT1 alone is unlikely to be responsible for initiating Sertoli cell differentiation. High DMRT1 expression in ZZ embryos (as early as Day 4.5) precedes the onset of Sertoli cell differentiation (from Day 6.5). Thus, another factor may be involved. One candidate is the transcription factor SOX9, which is only expressed in male medullary cords from Day 6.5 [24]. Male-specific SOX9 expression is highly conserved and has been considered a marker of Sertoli cell differentiation in chicken embryos and in humans, mice, and other vertebrates (reviewed in [35]). Vaillant et al. [34] found that SOX9 is activated in the transdifferentiating medullary cords of AI-treated chicken embryos undergoing female-to-male sex reversal. The embryos in that study were first examined at Day 14, when gonadal sex differentiation is complete. In the sex-reversed ZW embryos studies here, SOX9 expression was not seen at Day 6.5, but weak expression was first detected by whole mount in situ hybridization at Day 8.5 (stage 34), becoming stronger by Day 10.5 (stage 36) (Fig. 7). (More sensitive RT-PCR might show that SOX9 expression begins earlier in AI-reated embryos.) Increased expression may reflect increasing differentiation of seminferous cords during female-to-male sex reversal. Expression of SOX9 in AI-treated embryos was never as strong as that seen in normal males, however (Fig. 7), consistent with the smaller number of seminiferous cords observed in the AI-treated embryos (Fig. 1).The studies described here show that testis differentiation is correlated with an increase in DMRT1 expression in normal and sex-reversed chicken embryos. Testis formation in ZW (female) embryos shows that two copies of the DMRT1 gene are not necessary for testicular differentiation. However, upregulation of DMRT1 gene expression is correlated with differentiation. This finding provides some insight into the mechanism of avian sex determination. The 5′ regulatory region of cDMRT1 should be examined to gain an understanding of how this gene is regulated during gonadal development. Induction of female-to-male sex reversal by the overexpression of DMRT1 in ZW embryos would also be informative.Google ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarThis work was supported by a National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) grant to A.H.S. and C.A.S. and an NHMRC R.

It furthers the University's objective of excellence in research, scholarship, and education by publishing worldwideIn mammals, the phenotype of the homogametic sex develops in the (relative) absence of steroids and the phenotype of the heterogametic sex is imposed by the early action of steroids. In contrast, the heterogametic sex in avian species is the female and the presence of estrogens and their receptors plays a crucial role in female sexual differentiation. The time- and sex-dependent expression of enzymes involved in steroidogenesis which determine the ratio of androgens/estrogens produced by the gonads has been extensively investigated during the last 5–6 years. These results all show that the lack of estrogen synthesis in the male appears to be due to the extremely low levels of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and P450aromatase expression. In females, extensive expression of the aromatase gene (around day 5–6 of incubation), leading to estrogen synthesis, and specific expression of the estrogen receptor-mRNA in the left gonad results in the development of a functional left ovary. Other sex differences can be found in the expression of the inhibin subunit genes in gonads of chicken embryos and in circulating concentrations of inhibin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and steroids. Sex reversal attempts have been made by varying incubation temperatures, by using anti-estrogens, androgens, aromatase inhibitors and synthetic steroids. In ovo administration of a sex steroid hormone or an inhibitor of endogenous sex steroid synthesis can cause phenotypical sex reversal. All these experiments show that the development of gonads in birds is very sensitive to changes in the embryonic hormonal environment, sometimes resulting in changes of postnatal reproduction and even growth.Contribution of a special issue of Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology on Perinatal Development of Control Systems in Birds, collated by Guest editors Martin Nichelmann, Barbara Tzschentke and Heike Tönhardt.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

To analyze the process of sex reversal, we have followed for several months the changes induced by Fadrozole, a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, in gonadal aromatase activity and in morphology and structure of the female genital system. Fadrozole was injected into eggs on day four of incubation, and its effects were examined during the embryonic development and for eight months after hatching.In control females, aromatase activity in the right and the left gonad was high in the middle third of embryonic development, and then decreased up to hatching. After hatching, aromatase activity increased in the left ovary, in particular during folliculogenesis, whereas in the right regressing gonad, it continued to decrease to reach testicular levels at one month.In treated females, masculinization of the genital system was characterized by the maintenance of the right gonad and its differentiation into a testis, and by the differentiation of the left gonad into an ovotestis or a testis; however, in all individuals, the left Müllerian duct and the posterior part of the right Müllerian duct were maintained. In testes and ovotestes, aromatase activity was lower than in gonads of control females (except in the right gonad as of one month after hatching) but remained higher than in testes of control and treated males. Moreover, in ovotestes, aromatase activity was higher in parts displaying follicles than in parts devoid of follicles. The main structural changes in the gonads during sex reversal were partial (in ovotestes) or complete (in testes) degeneration of the cortex in the left gonad, and formation of an albuginea and differentiation of testicular cords/tubes in the two gonads. Testicular cords/tubes transdifferentiated from ovarian medullary cords and lacunae whose epithelium thickened and became Sertolian. Transdifferentiation occurred all along embryonic and postnatal development; thus, new testicular cords/tubes were continuously formed while others degenerated. The sex reversed gonads were also characterized by an abundant fibrous interstitial tissue and abnormal medullary condensations of lymphoid‐like cells; in the persisting testicular cords/tubes, spermatogenesis was delayed and impaired. Related to aromatase activity, persistence of too high levels of estrogens can explain the presence of oviducts, gonadal abnormalities and infertility in sex reversed females. J. Exp. Zool. 290:727–740, 2001. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.Volume290, Issue71 December 2001Pages 727-740Copyright © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.Dax-1, a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of transcription factors, is known to be involved in gonadal development in mammals. To date, Dax-1 has only been isolated in reptiles, birds and mammals. The expression of Dax-1 is down-regulated in the developing testis, but persists in the ovary of mice (Swain et al., Nat. Genet. 12 (1996) 404) and chicken (Smith et al., J. Mol. Endocrinol. 24 (2000) 23). Curiously, there is no sex difference in the expression patterns of Dax-1 in the American alligator (Western et al., Gene 241 (2000) 223). To understand its role(s) in gonadal development in vertebrates, molecular cloning of Dax-1 in amphibians is required. In this study, we cloned an amphibian Dax-1 homologue of the frog Rana rugosa and examined its expression profile during gonadal development. Cloned Dax-1 cDNA encoded a protein of 287 amino acids. Unlike mammalians that possess the three and one half repeat elements representing the putative DNA binding domain in the predicted sequence of Dax-1 protein, the frog had a single poorly conserved copy of the repeat unit. By RT-PCR analysis, the Dax-1 mRNA was detected in the liver and pancreas, but not in the testis and ovary of adult frogs. However, Dax-1 expression was seen first in the embryo at stage 12 and became stronger in tadpoles until stage X. The Dax-1 was transcribed in the testis stronger than in the ovary of frogs at stage XXV (just after completion of metamorphosis). In the gonad of frogs 2 months after metamorphosis (at this stage postmeiotic cells can be seen in the seminiferous tubules), the Dax-1 was expressed only in males. In addition, the Dax-1 transcription declined gradually as ovarian development proceeded, but its expression was down-regulated and then up-regulated rapidly when female-to-male sex reversal was caused by administration of testosterone into female tadpoles. Taken together, the results suggest that the Dax-1 may be closely involved in testicular development of amphibians.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Learn about our remote access optionsAromatase inhibitors administered prior to histological signs of gonadal sex differentiation can induce sex reversal of genetic female chickens. Under the effects of Fadrozole (CGS 16949A), a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, the right gonad generally becomes a testis, and the left gonad a testis or an ovotestis. We have compared the expression pattern of the genes encoding AMH (the anti‐Müllerian hormone), SF1 (steroidogenic factor 1), and SOX9 (a transcription factor related to SRY) in these sex‐reversed gonads with that in control testes and ovaries, using in situ hybridization with riboprobes on gonadal sections. In control males, the three genes are expressed in Sertoli cells of testicular cords; however, only SOX9 is male specific, since as observed previously AMH and SF1 but not SOX9 are expressed in the control female gonads. In addition to testicular‐like cords, sex‐reversed gonads present many lacunae with a composite, thick and flat epithelium. We show that during embryonic and postnatal development, AMH, SF1 and SOX9 are expressed in the epithelium of testicular‐like cords and in the thickened part but not in the flattened part of the epithelium of composite lacunae. AMH and SF1 but not SOX9 are expressed in follicular cells of ovotestes. Coexpression of the three genes, of which SOX9 is a specific Sertoli‐cell marker, provides strong evidence for the transdifferentiation of ovarian into testicular epithelium in gonads of female chickens treated with Fadrozole. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.In chicken, the male is homogametic (ZZ) while the female is heterogametic (ZW). Embryonic treatments with estrogens and antiestrogens have shown the implication of estrogens in gonadal sex differentiation. In males, estrogens induce inhibition of the right gonad and transient feminization of the left gonad; conversely in females, antiestrogens induce masculinization of gonads (reviewed by Scheib, 1983). Sex reversal of genetic females has been also obtained by in ovo injection of aromatase inhibitors prior to the first histological signs of gonadal sex differentiation. Aromatase is the enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens. Inhibiting its activity can result in the differentiation of a right testis and a left testis or ovotestis in ZW female chickens (Abinawanto et al., 1996; Burke and Henry, 1999; Elbrecht and Smith, 1992; Etches and Kagami, 1997; Vaillant et al., 2001; Wartenberg et al., 1992).Following treatment with Fadrozole (CGS 16949A), a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, we observed previously that differentiating gonads of sex‐reversed females, besides male characteristics such as testicular‐like cords and an albuginea, retained female characteristics such as lacunae and, in the case of ovotestes, cortex with follicles. All along embryonic and postnatal development, ovarian‐like lacunae bordered by a flat epithelium and lacunae bordered by a composite, flattened and thickened epithelium (“composite lacunae”), were present in the medulla of sex‐reversed gonads. In composite lacunae, germ cells were enclosed in the thickened epithelium as in Sertolian epithelium. These observations strongly suggested that ovarian lacunae can give rise to testicular cords or tubes in sex‐reversed gonads (Vaillant et al., 2001).Further characterization of Sertoli cell differentiation in testicular‐like cords and in composite lacunae requires molecular markers. Nishikimi et al. (2000) examined the expression of the gene encoding anti‐Müllerian hormone (AMH) in chick embryos after treatment with Fadrozole on day 3 of incubation. They observed that AMH mRNA expression significantly increased by days 7 and 8 in gonadal “medullary cords” of treated genetic females. However, as in the chicken AMH is expressed in gonads of both sexes prior to and during sexual differentiation of the gonads (Oréal et al., 1998, 2001; Smith et al., 1999a), AMH expression alone is not sufficient to characterize Sertoli cell differentiation in sex‐reversed gonads. A more specific marker of Sertoli cells during normal gonadal differentiation in the chicken is SOX9 (SRY HMG box related gene 9), a transcription factor closely related to the mammalian testis determining gene SRY appears to be involved in testis differentiation in all vertebrates (reviewed in Koopman, 1999; Pieau et al., 2000; Swain and Lovell‐Badge, 1999). In several studies, SOX9 transcripts were not detected in the undifferentiated genital ridges of both male and female chick embryos, and then were detected in differentiating testes but not in differentiating ovaries (Kent et al., 1996; Oréal et al., 1998; Smith et al., 1999a). In another study, a faint expression of SOX9 was observed in the undifferentiated genital ridges of both males and females. However, in accordance with the other studies, SOX9 expression was shown to be upregulated in differentiating testes whereas it was downregulated in differentiating ovaries (Morais da Silva et al., 1996).To unequivocally characterize Sertoli cells and, hence, determine how testicular cords differentiate in sex‐reversed gonads of female chickens, we examine here the expression of SOX9 in addition to that of AMH. We also examine the expression of the gene encoding SF1 (steroidogenic factor 1), an orphan nuclear receptor that is essential for regulation of the endocrine development and differentiation in vertebrates. In particular, this factor plays a key role in gonadal and adrenal development and regulates cytochrome P450 steroid hydroxylase genes that are involved in steroid biosynthesis, among which is aromatase (P450arom) (reviewed in Parker and Schimmer, 1997). In chickens as in mammals, SF1 is expressed in the undifferentiated genital ridges of both males and females. However, during gonadal sex differentiation, SF1 is upregulated in testes in mammals (Ikeda et al., 1994), whereas in chick embryos, it is upregulated in the left ovary (Smith et al., 1999a,b). After whole mount hybridization with a SF1 riboprobe, Smith et al. (1999b) detected transcripts in “medullary cords” of the left ovary but failed to detect transcripts in the testes. However, using direct in situ hybridization on frozen gonadal sections, Oréal et al. (2001) detected SF1 transcripts in the left ovary and in the testes as well: in the left ovary, transcripts were dispersed throughout the medulla; in the testes, SF1 coexpressed with AMH and SOX9 in Sertoli cells of testicular cords, an observation in accordance with data obtained in mammals (de Santa Barbara et al., 2000).Thus, in addition to Sertoli cell characterization, the expression patterns of AMH, SF1 and SOX9 in sex‐reversed gonads of females treated with an aromatase inhibitor may shed new light on the possible relationships between these genes and P450arom during gonadal sex differentiation in the chicken.The first histological signs of gonadal differentiation in chick embryos are detectable between the 6th and the 7th day of incubation. Fadrozole was injected into eggs of White Leghorn chickens on day 4 of incubation, and expression of AMH, SF1, and SOX9 in the gonads was examined on days 14 and 17 of embryonic development and 1 month after hatching. In situ hybridization of AMH, SF1, and SOX9 riboprobes was carried out on frozen sections of the gonads. Moreover, immunolocalization of fibronectin on the same or adjacent sections allowed us to monitor the structure of these gonads, as previously described (Oréal et al., 1998). Histology of gonads in individuals of the same ages was also performed.On days 14 and 17 of embryonic development, the structure of the gonads was not very different and the expression pattern of each of the three genes was similar. The left ovary of control females presented a well‐developed cortex at the surface. The cortex was cut up into groups of germ cells by strands of fibronectin‐positive material. The medulla was composed of lacunae bordered by a flat epithelium and of thin epithelial cords (the so‐called medullary cords) between which a fibronectin‐positive connective tissue was formed. Lacunae were wide in the dorsal part of the medulla and somewhat smaller underneath the cortex (Fig. 1A). AMH‐ and SF1‐transcript positive cells, often in patches, were detected in medullary cords, AMH mRNAs being mainly located below the cortex (Fig. 1B), whereas SF1 mRNAs were evenly distributed throughout the entire medulla (Fig. 1C). Some patches of AMH‐ and SF1‐transcript positive cells were in contact with the epithelium bordering ovarian lacunae, and sometimes this epithelium itself contained positive cells (Fig. 1B,C). AMH transcripts were also detected in some cells within the fibronectin‐positive material that splits up the cortex (Fig. 1B). SOX9 transcripts were not detected (not shown).Control female: immunolocalization of fibronectin and expression (mRNAs) of AMH, SF1, and SOX9 in gonads of 14‐day‐old chick embryo. A–C: Left ovary. D–G: Right gonad. D,E: double‐labeled section. AMH and SF1 but not SOX9 are expressed in the two gonads of the control female. AMH transcript‐positive cells are mainly localized underneath the cortex in the left ovary, whereas they are evenly distributed in the right gonad. SF1 mRNAs are detected throughout the medulla in the two gonads. Negative hybridization with SOX9 riboprobe is shown in the right gonad only. c, cortex; ggc, group of germ cells; l, lacunae; m, medulla; mc, medullary cords. Scale bars = 100 μm.The right gonad of control female embryos, much smaller than the left ovary, did not present a cortex but a thin surface epithelium. The medulla had a structure similar to that of the left ovary, except that small and large lacunae were evenly distributed in it (Fig. 1D). AMH‐ and SF1‐transcript positive cells, dispersed or in patches, were scattered throughout the medullary cords of the gonad (Fig. 1E,F). As in the left ovary, there was no SOX9 expression in the right gonad (Fig. 1G).In the testes of 14‐ and 17‐day‐old male embryos, the testicular cords (anlagen of seminiferous tubes) were fibronectin‐negative and thus were well delineated from the fibronectin‐positive interstitial tissue; a fibronectin‐positive albuginea was formed (Fig. 2A). AMH, SF1, and SOX9 were all expressed in Sertoli cells of testicular cords, AMH expression being stronger than that of SOX9, and SF1 expression being faint (Fig. 2B–D).Control male and Fadrozole‐treated female: immunolocalization of fibronectin and expression (mRNAs) of AMH, SF1, and SOX9 in gonads of 14‐day‐old chick embryos. A–D: Testis in a control male. E–H: Left gonad in a female treated with Fadrozole. I–L: Right gonad in the same treated female. A,D and E,H and I,L are double‐labeled sections. AMH, SF1, and SOX9 genes are coexpressed in the Sertolian epithelium of testicular cords of the control testis. In the gonads of the treated female, AMH, SF1, and SOX9 are expressed in testicular‐like cords and in some parts of the epithelium of lacunae (arrowheads; see Fig. 3 for higher magnification of such lacunae). The expression of the genes is weaker in the ventral than in the dorsal part in the left gonad, whereas it is similar in either part of the right gonad. a, albuginea; l, lacunae; tc, testicular cords; tlc, testicular‐like cords. Scale bar = 100 μm.One month after hatching, AMH, SF1, and SOX9 were still expressed in the Sertolian epithelium of seminiferous cords/tubes of control testes. In control females, the right gonad had mostly regressed, whereas follicles had developed in the cortex of the left ovary. AMH and SF1 but not SOX9 were expressed in follicular cells. AMH‐ and SF1‐transcript positive cells were also found outside follicles in the cortex. Moreover, SF1 was strongly expressed in some dispersed cells of the medulla (not shown).As observed in our previous experiments (Vaillant et al., 2001), in genetic males, Fadrozole treatment had no significant effect on testicular differentiation, whereas in genetic females, the right gonad became a testis and the left gonad a testis or an ovotestis.On days 14 and 17 of embryonic development, the left gonad of treated females was generally reduced in size compared to control ovaries. In some embryos, there was no remnant of the left ovarian cortex and an albuginea began to differentiate. The medulla contained epithelial cords of different sizes and lacunae. Epithelial cords looked like testicular cords, they were generally wider in the dorsal part of the gonad than in the ventral part. All these cords were fibronectin‐negative, whereas the tissue between them was fibronectin‐positive (Fig. 2E). In situ hybridization with AMH, SF1, and SOX9 riboprobes showed that the three genes were expressed in the testicular‐like cords of the gonad and that this expression was stronger in the dorsal than in the ventral cords (Fig. 2F–H).The right gonad was maintained but remained smaller than the left one. It was composed of testicular‐like cords of different sizes and lacunae equally distributed within relatively abundant fibronectin‐positive connective tissue and, as in the left gonad, an albuginea was differentiating (Fig. 2I). AMH, SF1, and SOX9 genes were expressed in the epithelium of the testicular‐like cords, each of them with a similar level of expression in either part of the gonad (Fig. 2J–L).In the two gonads of sex‐reversed females, besides ovarian‐like lacunae entirely bordered by a flat epithelium, many lacunae were bordered by a composite, thickened and flattened, epithelium. The thickened epithelium of these composite lacunae was Sertolian‐like and sometimes enclosed germ cells (Fig. 3A,B). AMH, SF1, and SOX9 were expressed in the thickened but not in the flattened epithelium of composite lacunae and in the epithelium of testicular‐like cords prolonging the lacunae (Fig. 3D,F,H; compare with Fig. 3C,E,G for the fibronectin distribution in the same sections; see also arrowheads in Fig. 2F,G,H,L).Lacunae and testicular‐like cords in gonads of 17‐day‐old female chick embryos treated with Fadrozole. A,B: Histological structure of the left (A) and the right (B) gonads. In addition to testicular‐like cords (tlc), ovarian‐like lacunae (oll) and composite lacunae (cl) with both a flat epithelium and a thickened epithelium are present within the two gonads; the thickened epithelium encloses germ cells (gc). C–H: Immunolocalization of fibronectin and expression (mRNAs) of AMH, SF1 and SOX9 in the left gonad. C,D, and E,F, and G,H are double‐labeled sections. AMH, SF1, and SOX9 mRNAs are present in the thickened part but not in the flattened part of the epithelial wall of composite lacunae (cl) and/or in the epithelium of testicular‐like cords (tlc) prolonging the lacunae (l). Scale bar = 50 μm.At one month, in addition to testicular‐like cords, some composite lacunae were still present in the testes of sex‐reversed females; the expression pattern of AMH, SF1, and SOX9 was similar to that in 14‐ and 17‐day‐old embryos (not shown).In many treated females, parts of the ovarian cortex were maintained and developed together with a testicular part in the left gonad, which became an ovotestis. One month after hatching, such gonads were covered by an albuginea and, in addition to testicular‐like cords, displayed follicles and lacunae within abundant fibronectin‐positive connective tissue (Fig. 4A). AMH and SF1 mRNAs were detected in testicular‐like cords and in follicular cells as well. In addition, SF1 and AMH mRNAs were detected in dispersed cells or cell clusters in the ovarian part of the ovotestis, SF1 mRNAs being more largely distributed than AMH mRNAs (Fig. 4B,C). SOX9 was expressed in testicular‐like cords but neither in follicular cells nor in other parts of the ovarian cortex (Fig. 4D). As shown in testes of sex‐reversed females, composite lacunae were still present in ovotestes at one month (Fig. 4E). The thickened but not the flattened parts of their epithelium contained AMH, SF1, and SOX9 transcripts (Fig. 4F–H). Likewise, some lacunae were prolonged by testicular‐like cords in which the three genes were expressed (see Fig. 4B,D for expression of both AMH and SOX9 in such cords).Left ovotestis of a 1‐month‐old female chicken treated with Fadrozole: immunolocalization of fibronectin (A,E) and expression (mRNAs) of AMH (B,F), SF1 (C,G), and SOX9 (D,H). A: The gonad contains ovarian follicles (f) and lacunae (l) together with testicular‐like cords (tlc) in abundant fibronectin‐positive connective tissue; it is covered by an albuginea (a). B–D: AMH and SF1 mRNAs are present in testicular‐like cords, follicular cells and some other dispersed cells or cell clusters of the ovarian cortex (c), whereas SOX9 mRNAs are present in testicular‐like cords but neither in follicular cells nor in other cells of the ovarian cortex. Arrowheads: composite lacuna prolonged by a testicular‐like cord. E–H: A composite lacuna (cl) with both a flat and a thickened epithelium; AMH, SF1, and SOX9 are coexpressed in the thickened part but not in the flattened part of the epithelium; E,G is a double‐labeled section. Scale bars = 50 μm.Following treatment with Fadrozole prior to histological signs of gonadal sex differentiation, the gonads of genetic female chickens can differentiate into two testes or into a right testis and a left ovotestis. We observed previously that together with testicular‐like cords, ovarian‐like lacunae bordered by a flat epithelium and lacunae bordered by a composite flat and thick epithelium, were present in these sex‐reversed gonads all along embryonic development and after hatching (Vaillant et al., 2001). We show here that, in 14‐ and 17‐day‐old embryos and in 1‐month‐old chickens, the AMH, SF1, and SOX9 genes are coexpressed in the epithelium of testicular‐like cords as in control males, whereas AMH and SF1 but not SOX9 are expressed in the ovarian part of ovotestes, in particular in follicular cells, as in control ovaries. Thus, as shown previously (Oréal et al., 1998, 2001), of the three genes, only SOX9 is specific of Sertoli cell differentiation in the chicken. Expression of this gene, in addition to expression of AMH and SF1 in the epithelium of testicular‐like cords of sex‐reversed gonads, demonstrates that these cords are really differentiating testicular cords. Moreover, AMH, SF1, and SOX9 genes are also coexpressed in the thickened part but not in the flattened part of the epithelium of composite lacunae in embryos and in 1‐month‐old individuals as well. This provides strong evidence for the transdifferentiation of the epithelium of ovarian lacunae into Sertolian epithelium and thus for the formation of testicular cords from ovarian lacunae during sex reversal of ZW female chickens.Composite lacunae had already been described in 12‐day‐old female chick embryos treated with Fadrozole (Wartenberg et al., 1992) and 50 years ago in the sex‐reversed right gonad of female chickens after posthatching removal of the left ovary (Benoit, 1950). Such lacunae were also observed in embryos and hatchlings of the turtle Emys orbicularis, a species with temperature‐dependent sex determination, after treatments with aromatase inhibitors (Fadrozole or Letrozole) at a female‐producing temperature; treatments were performed during the thermosensitive period (Dorizzi et al., 1994; Richard‐Mercier et al., 1995) or even somewhat after this period (Belaïd et al., 2001; Dorizzi et al., 1996). In all these studies, composite lacunae were considered to give rise to testicular cords. The origin of testicular cords during sex reversal of female ovaries appears different in mammals. Structures resembling seminiferous tubules were observed in sexually mature ovaries of mice lacking estrogen receptors α and β (αβERKO females). Using ultrastructural characterization (Dupont et al., 2000) or biochemical characterization, i.e., immunoreactivity for AMH and sulfated glycoprotein‐2 and expression of AMH and SOX9 (Couse et al., 1999), these structures were shown to result from transdifferentiation of follicular cells to Sertoli‐like cells. Sex reversal of 13.5 dpc fetal mouse ovaries grafted to the kidney capsule of adult male mice was followed using SOX9 expression, by whole mount in situ hybridization, to characterize Sertoli cell differentiation. By 18 days after grafting, SOX9 expression was detected in isolated cells in some grafts. By 26–30 days, cells were organized into cord‐like structures, many of them showing quite strong SOX9 expression. These cells had morphological characteristics of Sertoli cells and were considered as most likely resulting from transdifferentiation of follicular cells to Sertoli‐like cells (Morais da Silva et al., 1996). The present study shows that during Fadrozole‐induced sex reversal of female chickens, testicular cords are formed from medullary cords and ovarian lacunae. Even in ovotestes, we could not characterize transdifferentiation of follicular cells to Sertoli cells, since we never observed SOX9 expression in follicles.The different grades of sex reversal and the occurrence of composite lacunae in female chickens treated with Fadrozole was related to the levels of gonadal aromatase activity. Indeed, aromatase activity in sex‐reversed gonads, although significantly lower than in control ovaries, remained somewhat higher than in control testes (Vaillant et al., 2001). This strongly suggests that, during normal gonadal development, differentiation of testicular cords on the one hand, and differentiation of ovarian medullary cords/lacunae on the other hand, depend on the levels of endogenous estrogens: testicular cords differentiate when estrogen levels remain low whereas ovarian medullary cords/lacunae differentiate when estrogen levels are high. Estrogen synthesis depends on aromatase activity, which itself depends on P450arom expression. There is an inverse relationship between P450arom expression on the one hand, and AMH and SOX9 expression on the other hand in chick embryos. During normal development, P450arom mRNAs begin to be detected at day 6 of incubation in the medullary cords of female gonads but not in the male gonads (Nishikimi et al., 2000). At the same time, SOX9 mRNAs begin to be detected and AMH expression increases strongly in differentiating testicular cords of male gonads (Oréal et al., 1998). After treatment of female embryos with an aromatase inhibitor, P450arom expression and activity decrease whereas AMH expression increases and SOX9 expression appears in sex‐reversed gonads (Nishikimi et al., 2000; Vaillant et al., 2001; this study). On the other hand, estradiol treatment of male embryos results in higher P450arom expression and lower AMH expression (Nishikimi et al., 2000). Therefore, in gonads of chick embryos, no expression of SOX9 and a lower expression of AMH correspond to a high expression of P450arom, whereas a lower or no expression of P450arom corresponds to expression of SOX9 and a higher expression of AMH. SF1 could play a pivotal role in this mechanism. In mammals, this factor has been shown to be involved in the expression of both the P450arom and the AMH genes (Arango et al., 1999; de Santa Barbara et al., 1998; Parker and Schimmer, 1997). In normal chick embryos, SF1 is expressed in the undifferentiated gonads of both sexes prior to P450arom and AMH expression and remains expressed during gonadal sex differentiation when P450arom expression increases in female gonads and AMH expression increases in male gonads (Oréal et al., 2001; Smith et al., 1999a,b). SF1 also remains expressed in gonads during sex reversal (this study). However, Smith et al. (1999b) noticed that both SF1 and P450arom genes were upregulated at the same time, between days 6 and 7 in the female gonads (according to Smith et al., 1999b; Yoshida et al., 1996), whereas the marked elevation of AMH expression as of day 6 (according to Oréal et al., 1998) was correlated with only a modest increase in SF1 expression in males. Thus, they considered that in the chicken, SF1 would be involved in the activation and upregulation of P450arom expression in the female gonads, whereas it would be required for the activation but not the upregulation of AMH expression in the male gonads. Nevertheless, there is a slight discrepancy between the observations of Smith et al. (1999b) and our own observations. Smith et al. (1999b) failed to detect SF1 transcripts in testicular cords on gonadal sections of SF1‐whole mounts of 8.5‐day‐old male embryos. With our in situ hybridization method, at all ages of our study, we found SF1 transcripts together with AMH and SOX9 transcripts in the epithelium of testicular cords, not only in gonads of control males (as Oréal et al., 2001) but also in gonads of treated females and in the Sertolian‐like epithelium of composite lacunae. Thus, in our opinion, the implication of SF1 in the upregulation of AMH expression cannot be rejected in the chicken. So far, the role of SF1 and of other known, or yet unidentified factors in the regulatory mechanisms of P450arom, AMH and SOX9 expression in chicken gonads requires further studies.White Leghorn eggs from a commercial supplier were incubated at 38°C and treated on day 4 with a single injection of 1 mg of Fadrozole (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) in 0.1 ml of a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. Control eggs received PBS alone. The solution was injected into the albumen at the pointed end of the eggs. Shell holes were sealed with paraffin.Individuals were sacrificed at days 14 and 17 of embryonic development, and 1 month after hatching. At each age, gonads were processed either for in situ hybridization with AMH, SF1, and SOX9 riboprobes and then immunohistochemistry, or for histology.In situ hybridization was carried out with chick AMH, SF1, and SOX9, digoxigenin‐labeled riboprobes. The AMH and SOX9 probes have been previously described and used for normal development of the gonads (Carré‐Eusèbe et al., 1996; Oréal et al., 1998). The SF1 probe was obtained by RT‐PCR amplification of a 824‐bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides 731 to 1554 of the chick SF1 mRNA sequence (accession no. AB002404), using RNA isolated from 8‐day embryonic gonads. The amplified fragment was cloned into pGEMT‐easy vector (Promega) and identified by sequencing. The plasmid was linearized and transcribed with T7 or Sp6 RNA polymerases using the digoxigenin labeling kit (Boehringer) to synthetise antisense or sense riboprobes, respectively. Gonads were successively fixed 2 hr in cold 4% paraformaldehyde‐PBS, washed in PBS with increasing concentrations of sucrose, embedded in Tissue‐Tek O.C.T. Compound (Miles, Inc., Kankakee, IL), frozen at −20°C and sectioned at 5 μm with a cryostat. Hybridizations with sense and antisense probes were performed as described (Oréal et al., 1998).To identify gonadal structures, the distribution of fibronectin was examined on sections previously treated by in situ hybridization (double labeling) or on adjacent sections, using a rabbit anti‐human plasma fibronectin serum (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, 6071 SA). This antibody was previously demonstrated to cross‐react with chick fibronectin (Oréal et al., 1998). Sections were washed in PBS, and indirect immunofluorescence detection was performed as described (Fridmacher et al., 1995). For histology, gonads were fixed in Bouin's solution, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and serially sectioned at 7.5 μm; sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin.We thank Dr. A.S.

Unlike mammals, sex determination in birds operates through a ZZ/ZW sex chromosome system, in which the female is the heterogametic sex. However, the molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Comparative gene mapping revealed that several genes on human chromosome 9 (HSA 9) have homologs on the chicken Z chromosome (GGA Z), indicating the common ancestry of large parts of GGA Z and HSA 9. Based on chromosome homology maps, we isolated a Z-linked chicken ortholog of DMRT1, which has been implicated in XY sex reversal in humans. Its location on the avian Z and within the sex-reversal region on HSA 9p suggests that DMRT1 represents an ancestral dosage-sensitive gene for vertebrate sex-determination. Z dosage may be crucial for male sexual differentiation/determination in birds.   © 2000 S. Karger AG, BaselPublished online: June 26, 2000

Consistent with a role in sex determination, we find that Sox9 expression closely follows differentiation of Sertoli cells in the mouse testis, in experimental sex reversal when fetal ovaries are grafted to adult kidneys and in the chick where there is no evidence for a Sry gene. Our results imply that Sox9 plays an essential role in sex determination, possibly immediately downstream of Sry in mammals, and that it functions as a critical Sertoli cell differentiation factor, perhaps in all vertebrates.Subscribe to JournalGet full journal access for 1 year55,14 €only 4,60 € per issueAll prices are NET prices.

Individual genetic sex was evaluated by Southern blot analysis of red blood cells using a female sex chromosomal W-specific DNA probe. Saline injection had no sex reversal effect, whereas AI injection resulted in 50% sex reversal from genetic female but no effect on male. Levels of P45017αmRNA were high in both ovary and testis in the control group but these levels were lowered significantly in ovary, testis, and sex-reversed gonad (testis) in the AI-treated group. On the other hand, levels of P450arommRNA in the ovary were higher than those in the testis of the control group. AI treatment significantly suppressed ovarian levels of P450arommRNA. Although estradiol alone failed to prevent the phenotypic male to female change, coadministration of estrogen suppressed the sex-reversal effect of AI and restored mRNA levels of P450aromin the ovary to control levels. These results suggest that expression of P450arommRNA and estrogen plays an important role in sex differentiation of the female gonad of the chicken.To whom correspondence and reprint requests should be addressed.

Chicken embryos were treated on day three of incubation with a steroidal or a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (1‐methyl‐andro‐stendion, CGS 16949 A). Complete sex reversal of ovaries into testes or intermediate stages of sex reversal resulted from the inhibitory effect on oestradiol formation during gonadal development before and during sexual differentiation. Germ cell differentiation shifted from the female to the male pattern depending on the local advance of sex reversal.Volume24, Issue1January‐February 1992Pages 1-6The study examined the effect of testosterone on the asymmetry of visual discrimination performance of young chicks. Two-week-old chicks were tested on the pebble floor visual discrimination task. Male chicks were found to have brain asymmetry for visual discrimination learning, since chicks tested binocularly, or tested monocularly using their right eye system, have superior learning performance compared to chicks tested monocularly using their left eye system. Control female chicks were not found to have brain asymmetry. Testosterone treatment (12.5 mg of testosterone oenanthate on day 2 posthatch) reversed the pattern of brain asymmetry observed in control males but not females. In addition, asymmetry of visual discrimination learning is demonstrated in both male and female chicks after unilateral intracranial treatment with monosodium glutamate.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

This sex reversal remains permanent, as shown by three adult fowls described in this paper. They possess two testes associated with normally differentiated male excretory ducts and their Müllerian ducts have regressed. The development of male sex characteristics such as external features, behavior and complete spermatogenesis is evidence that these cocks have endocrine and exocrine capabilities similar to those of normal cocks. Although these cocks were able to mate with female fowls, they were sterile. A mechanism is discussed by which grafted testes induce such modifications in females.Hypotheses considering the heterogametic sex (female in birds) as exerting a dominant influence on the phenotypic sexual differentiation can be discarded in light of our results because a homogametic testis provokes the definitive sex inversion of a female.Oxford University Press is a department of the University of Oxford. It furthers the University's objective of excellence in research, scholarship, and education by publishing worldwideTestes of either newborn rats or newly hatched chickens, dissociated into single cell suspensions, reorganize in vitro into their histotypic structures. In birds, the heterogametic female sex is H-Y antigen positive, and not the male as in mammals. Cocultivation of rat and chicken testicular cells results in the reorganization of an ovotestis. A similar result is obtained after cultivation of chicken testicular cells in the supernatant medium of cultured human male Burkitt lymphoma Daudi cells. Rat testicular Sertoli cells as well as Daudi cells are a source of H-Y antigen. The simultaneous application of H-Y antigen and anti-H-Y antiserum prevents ovotestis formation. It is concluded that H-Y antigen which is known to be testis-organizing in mammals, is the ovary-organizing factor in birds.Supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (SFB 46)We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

In addition, we have tested in the rat several experimental conditions potentially susceptible to induce progesterone receptors. With the exception of chicken, tfm patients and possibly the frogs, progesterone receptors could not be conclusively demonstrated in any of the other animal species tested nor could they be induced in the rat. Surprisingly, they were not present in Stanley-Grumbeck pseudohermaphrodite rats. In chicken testes, the levels of progesterone receptor were variable (3–45 fmol per mg prot.) in the adults and high (87 fmol per mg prot.) in one-day-old animals. The presence of progesterone receptor, a marker of estradiol action in many estrogen-target tissues, seems to be parallel to the capacity of chicken testes for sex reversal under the influence of estrogens. In human tfm, the presence of these receptors could also indicate that the gonads are estrogen-sensitive or that they were so during embryonic life although the nature of estrogenic action is not known.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.
