32654587,Steroid androgen 17 alpha methyltestosterone used in fish farming induces biochemical alterations in zebrafish adults.,"Rivero-Wendt CLG, Miranda-Vilela AL, Domingues I, Oliveira R, Monteiro MS, Moura-Mello MAM, Matias R, Soares AMVM, Grisolia CK",J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng. 2020 Jul 11:1-12. doi: 10.1080/10934529.2020.1790954.,"The 17 alpha methyltestosterone (MT) hormone is fed to Oreochromis niloticus larvae in fish farms with the purpose of inducing sex reversal. The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity and sub-lethality of MT (99.9% purity) and cMT (a commercial MT with 90% purity) in zebrafish (Danio rerio) adults, where the animals were exposed to concentrations of 0, 4, 23, 139, 833 and 5000 microg/L for 96 hours. Genotoxicity was evaluated by micronucleus test (MN), nuclear abnormalities (NA) and comet assay. A low genotoxic potential of MT was showed, inducing micronucleus, nuclear abnormalities and DNA damage in Danio rerio, depending on the use of MT or cMT, gender and tested concentrations. In the sub-lethality trials, there was a basal difference in the activity of the enzymatic biochemical markers for males and females, while the Glutatione S transferase (GST) activity decreased in all analyzed tissues, and for males the enzymatic activity decreased only in the intestine. Results suggest that MT has a toxic potential to fish because it alters enzymatic metabolic pathways and may pose a risk to the ecosystems."
32194632,Beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Genes in Orange-Spotted Grouper (Epinephelus coioides): Genome-Wide Identification and Expression Analysis During Sex Reversal.,"Xiao L, Guo Y, Wang D, Zhao M, Hou X, Li S, Lin H, Zhang Y",Front Genet. 2020 Mar 4;11:161. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2020.00161. eCollection 2020.,"Beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (beta-HSDs) are a group of steroidogenic enzymes that are involved in steroid biosynthesis and metabolism, and play a crucial role in mammalian physiology and development, including sex determination and differentiation. In the present study, a genome-wide analysis identified the numbers of beta-hsd genes in orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) (19), human (Homo sapiens) (22), mouse (Mus musculus) (24), chicken (Gallus gallus) (16), xenopus (Xenopus tropicalis) (24), coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) (17), spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) (14), zebrafish (Danio rerio) (19), fugu (Takifugu rubripes) (19), tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) (19), medaka (Oryzias latipes) (19), stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) (17) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) (27) samples. A comparative analysis revealed that the number of beta-hsd genes in teleost fish was no greater than in tetrapods due to gene loss followed by a teleost-specific whole-genome duplication event. Based on transcriptome data from grouper brain and gonad samples during sex reversal, six beta-hsd genes had relatively high expression levels in the brain, indicating that these genes may be required for neurogenesis or the maintenance of specific biological processes in the brain. In the gonad, two and eight beta-hsd genes were up- and downregulated, respectively, indicating their important roles in sex reversal. Our results demonstrated that beta-hsd genes may be involved in the sex reversal of grouper by regulating the synthesis and metabolism of sex steroid hormones."
31910818,Anti-masculinization induced by aromatase inhibitors in adult female zebrafish.,"Chen L, Wang L, Cheng Q, Tu YX, Yang Z, Li RZ, Luo ZH, Chen ZX",BMC Genomics. 2020 Jan 7;21(1):22. doi: 10.1186/s12864-019-6437-z.,"BACKGROUND: Early sex differentiation genes of zebrafish remain an unsolved mystery due to the difficulty to distinguish the sex of juvenile zebrafish. However, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) could direct juvenile zebrafish sex differentiation to male and even induce ovary-to-testis reversal in adult zebrafish. RESULTS: In order to determine the transcriptomic changes of sex differentiation in juvenile zebrafish and early sex-reversal in adult zebrafish, we sequenced the transcriptomes of juvenile and adult zebrafish treated with AI exemestane (EM) for 32 days, when juvenile zebrafish sex differentiation finished. EM treatment in females up-regulated the expression of genes involved in estrogen metabolic process, female gamete generation and oogenesis, including gsdf, macf1a and paqr5a, while down-regulated the expression of vitellogenin (vtg) genes, including vtg6, vtg2, vtg4, and vtg7 due to the lower level of Estradiol (E2). Furthermore, EM-juveniles showed up-regulation in genes related to cell death and apoptosis, such as bcl2l16 and anax1c, while the control-juveniles exhibited up-regulation of genes involved in positive regulation of reproductive process and oocyte differentiation such as zar1 and zpcx. Moreover, EM-females showed higher enrichment than control females in genes involved in VEGF signaling pathway, glycosaminoglycan degradation, hedgehog signaling pathway, GnRH signaling pathway and steroid hormone biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows anti-masculinization in EM-treated adult females but not in EM-treated juveniles. This may be responsible for the lower sex plasticity in adults than juveniles."
31899193,Mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) are less sensitive to 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) than other common model teleosts: A comparative review of reproductive effects.,"Rutherford R, Lister A, Bosker T, Blewett T, Gillio Meina E, Chehade I, Kanagasabesan T, MacLatchy D",Gen Comp Endocrinol. 2020 Apr 1;289:113378. doi: 10.1016/j.ygcen.2019.113378. Epub 2019 Dec 31.,"The environmental estrogen 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) will depress or completely inhibit egg production in many common model teleosts at low concentrations (</=0.5 ng/L; Runnalls et al., 2015). This inhibition is not seen in the estuarine killifish, or mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), even when exposed to 100 ng/L EE2. This relative insensitivity to EE2 exposure indicates species-specific mechanisms for compensating for exogenous estrogenic exposure. This review compares various reproductive responses elicited by EE2 in mummichog to other common model teleosts, such as zebrafish (Danio rerio) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), identifying key endpoints where mummichog differ from other studied fish. For example, EE2 accumulates primarily in the liver/gall bladder of mummichog, which is different than zebrafish and fathead minnow in which accumulation is predominantly in the carcass. Despite causing species-specific differences in fecundity, EE2 has been shown to consistently induce hepatic vitellogenin in males and cause feminization/sex reversal during gonadal differentiation in larval mummichog, similar to other species. In addition, while gonadal steroidogenesis and plasma steroid levels respond to exogenous EE2, it is generally at higher concentrations than observed in other species. In mummichog, production of 17beta-estradiol (E2) by full grown ovarian follicles remains high; unlike other teleost models where E2 synthesis decreases as 17alpha,20beta-dihydroxy-4-prenen-3-on levels increase to induce oocyte maturation. New evidence in mummichog indicates some dissimilarity in gonadal steroidogenic gene expression responses compared to gene expression responses in zebrafish and fathead minnow exposed to EE2. The role of ovarian physiology continues to warrant investigation regarding the tolerance of mummichog to exogenous EE2 exposure. Here we present a comprehensive review, highlighting key biological differences in response to EE2 exposure between mummichog and other commonly used model teleosts."
31319296,Male-biased zebrafish sex differentiation and metabolomics profile changes caused by dydrogesterone.,"Jiang YX, Shi WJ, Ma DD, Zhang JN, Ying GG, Zhang H, Ong CN",Aquat Toxicol. 2019 Sep;214:105242. doi: 10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.105242. Epub 2019 Jul 11.,"Some progestins, including the widely used dydrogesterone (DDG), have been shown to cause male-biased sex ratio in teleost. However, there is a gap to fully understand the mechanisms of the sex differentiation disturbance by progestins, particularly from the metabolic aspect. We thus aimed to examine the sex changes by exposing zebrafish embryos to 4.4 (L), 44 (M) and 440 (H) ng/L DDG for up to 140 days, and investigated metabolomic profile changes during the critical period of sex differentiation at fry stage (35 dpf). DDG increased the percentage of male zebrafish in a dose-dependent manner, with 98% male fish in the high concentration group. In zebrafish fry, DDG increased the levels of some free fatty acids, monoglycerides, acylcarnitines, organic acids, free amino acids, while decreased lysophospholipids, uric acid and bile acids. DDG exposure also decreased the nucleoside monophosphates and UDP-sugars while increased nucleosides and their bases. These metabolite changes, namely increase in n-3 PUFAs (polyunsaturated fatty acids), myo-inositol, taurine, palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, lactic acid, fumaric acid, and uracil, and decrease in uric acid and bile acids, might account for the male-biased sex ratio in zebrafish. It appears that many of these metabolites could inhibit several pathways that regulate zebrafish gonad differentiation, including NF-kappaB/COX-2 and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways, and activate p53 pathway. Thus we proposed a hypothesis that DDG might induce oocytes apoptosis through the above pathways and finally lead to female-to-male sex reversal. The results from this study suggest that DDG at environmentally relevant concentrations could affect zebrafish metabolomic profiles and finally disturb fish sex differentiation."
30540754,"Multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of 19 Fanconi anemia pathway genes in zebrafish revealed their roles in growth, sexual development and fertility.","Ramanagoudr-Bhojappa R, Carrington B, Ramaswami M, Bishop K, Robbins GM, Jones M, Harper U, Frederickson SC, Kimble DC, Sood R, Chandrasekharappa SC",PLoS Genet. 2018 Dec 12;14(12):e1007821. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1007821. eCollection 2018 Dec.,"Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a genomic instability syndrome resulting in aplastic anemia, developmental abnormalities, and predisposition to hematological and other solid organ malignancies. Mutations in genes that encode proteins of the FA pathway fail to orchestrate the repair of DNA damage caused by DNA interstrand crosslinks. Zebrafish harbor homologs for nearly all known FA genes. We used multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis to generate loss-of-function mutants for 17 FA genes: fanca, fancb, fancc, fancd1/brca2, fancd2, fance, fancf, fancg, fanci, fancj/brip1, fancl, fancm, fancn/palb2, fanco/rad51c, fancp/slx4, fancq/ercc4, fanct/ube2t, and two genes encoding FA-associated proteins: faap100 and faap24. We selected two indel mutations predicted to cause premature truncations for all but two of the genes, and a total of 36 mutant lines were generated for 19 genes. Generating two independent mutant lines for each gene was important to validate their phenotypic consequences. RT-PCR from homozygous mutant fish confirmed the presence of transcripts with indels in all genes. Interestingly, 4 of the indel mutations led to aberrant splicing, which may produce a different protein than predicted from the genomic sequence. Analysis of RNA is thus critical in proper evaluation of the consequences of the mutations introduced in zebrafish genome. We used fluorescent reporter assay, and western blots to confirm loss-of-function for several mutants. Additionally, we developed a DEB treatment assay by evaluating morphological changes in embryos and confirmed that homozygous mutants from all the FA genes that could be tested (11/17), displayed hypersensitivity and thus were indeed null alleles. Our multiplexing strategy helped us to evaluate 11 multiple gene knockout combinations without additional breeding. Homozygous zebrafish for all 19 single and 11 multi-gene knockouts were adult viable, indicating FA genes in zebrafish are generally not essential for early development. None of the mutant fish displayed gross developmental abnormalities except for fancp-/- fish, which were significantly smaller in length than their wildtype clutch mates. Complete female-to-male sex reversal was observed in knockouts for 12/17 FA genes, while partial sex reversal was seen for the other five gene knockouts. All adult females were fertile, and among the adult males, all were fertile except for the fancd1 mutants and one of the fancj mutants. We report here generation and characterization of zebrafish knockout mutants for 17 FA disease-causing genes, providing an integral resource for understanding the pathophysiology associated with the disrupted FA pathway."
29851175,Why are triploid zebrafish all male?,"Delomas TA, Dabrowski K",Mol Reprod Dev. 2018 Jul;85(7):612-621. doi: 10.1002/mrd.22998. Epub 2018 Jul 16.,"Adult triploid zebrafish Danio rerio has previously been reported to be all male. This phenomenon has only been reported in one other gonochoristic fish species, the rosy bitterling Rhodeus ocellatus, despite the fact that triploidy is induced in numerous species. To investigate the mechanism responsible, we first produced triploid zebrafish and observed gonad development. Histological sections of juvenile triploid gonads showed that primary growth oocytes were able to develop in the juvenile ovary, but no cortical alveolus or more advanced oocytes were found. All adult triploids examined were male (n = 160). Male triploids were able to induce oviposition by diploid females during natural spawning trials, but fertilization rates were low (1.0 +/- 3.1%) compared with diploid male siblings (67.4 +/- 16.6%). The embryos produced by triploid sires were aneuploid with a mean ploidy of 2.4 +/- 0.1n, demonstrating that triploid males produce aneuploid spermatozoa. After confirming that adult triploids are all male, we produced an additional batch of triploid zebrafish and exposed them (and a group of diploid siblings) to 100 ng/L estradiol (E2) from 5 to 28 dpf. The E2 treated triploids and nontreated triploids were all male. The nontreated diploids were also all male, but the E2 treated diploids were 89% female. This demonstrates that triploidy acts downstream of estrogen synthesis in the sex differentiation pathway to induce male development. Based on this and the observations of juvenile gonad development in triploids, we suggest that triploidy inhibits development of oocytes past the primary growth stage, and this causes female to male sex reversal."
29735715,ZNRF3 functions in mammalian sex determination by inhibiting canonical WNT signaling.,"Harris A, Siggers P, Corrochano S, Warr N, Sagar D, Grimes DT, Suzuki M, Burdine RD, Cong F, Koo BK, Clevers H, Stevant I, Nef S, Wells S, Brauner R, Ben Rhouma B, Belguith N, Eozenou C, Bignon-Topalovic J, Bashamboo A, McElreavey K, Greenfield A",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2018 May 22;115(21):5474-5479. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1801223115. Epub 2018 May 7.,"Mammalian sex determination is controlled by the antagonistic interactions of two genetic pathways: The SRY-SOX9-FGF9 network promotes testis determination partly by opposing proovarian pathways, while RSPO1/WNT-beta-catenin/FOXL2 signals control ovary development by inhibiting SRY-SOX9-FGF9. The molecular basis of this mutual antagonism is unclear. Here we show that ZNRF3, a WNT signaling antagonist and direct target of RSPO1-mediated inhibition, is required for sex determination in mice. XY mice lacking ZNRF3 exhibit complete or partial gonadal sex reversal, or related defects. These abnormalities are associated with ectopic WNT/beta-catenin activity and reduced Sox9 expression during fetal sex determination. Using exome sequencing of individuals with 46,XY disorders of sex development, we identified three human ZNRF3 variants in very rare cases of XY female presentation. We tested two missense variants and show that these disrupt ZNRF3 activity in both human cell lines and zebrafish embryo assays. Our data identify a testis-determining function for ZNRF3 and indicate a mechanism of direct molecular interaction between two mutually antagonistic organogenetic pathways."
28838139,Mutation of foxl2 or cyp19a1a Results in Female to Male Sex Reversal in XX Nile Tilapia.,"Zhang X, Li M, Ma H, Liu X, Shi H, Li M, Wang D",Endocrinology. 2017 Aug 1;158(8):2634-2647. doi: 10.1210/en.2017-00127.,"It is well accepted that Forkhead box protein L2 (Foxl2) and aromatase (Cyp19a1; the enzyme responsible for estrogen synthesis) are critical for ovarian development in vertebrates. Knockouts of Foxl2 and Cyp19a1 in goat, mouse, and zebrafish have revealed similar but not identical functions across species. Functional analyses of these two genes in other animals are needed to elucidate their conserved roles in vertebrate sexual development. In this study, we established foxl2 and cyp19a1a mutant lines in Nile tilapia. Both foxl2-/- and cyp19a1a-/- XX fish displayed female-to-male sex reversal. Sf1, Dmrt1, and Gsdf were upregulated in the foxl2-/- and the cyp19a1a-/- XX gonads. Downregulation of Cyp19a1a and serum estradiol-17beta level, and upregulation of Cyp11b2 and serum 11-ketotestosterone level were observed in foxl2-/- XX fish. The mutant phenotype of foxl2-/- XX individuals could be rescued by 17beta-estradiol treatment from 5 to 30 days after hatching (dah). Upregulation of Star1, the enzyme involved in androgen production in tilapia, was also observed in the foxl2-/- XX gonad at 30 and 90 dah. In vitro promoter analyses consistently demonstrated that Foxl2 could suppress the transcription of star1 in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, compared with the control XX gonad, fewer germ cells were detected in the foxl2-/- XX, cyp19a1a-/- XX, and control XY gonads 10 dah. These results demonstrate that Foxl2 promotes ovarian development by upregulating Cyp19a1a expression and repressing male pathway gene expression. These results extend the study of Foxl2 and Cyp19a1a loss of function to a commercially important fish species."
28738802,Histological and transcriptomic effects of 17alpha-methyltestosterone on zebrafish gonad development.,"Lee SLJ, Horsfield JA, Black MA, Rutherford K, Fisher A, Gemmell NJ",BMC Genomics. 2017 Jul 24;18(1):557. doi: 10.1186/s12864-017-3915-z.,"BACKGROUND: Sex hormones play important roles in teleost ovarian and testicular development. In zebrafish, ovarian differentiation appears to be dictated by an oocyte-derived signal via Cyp19a1a aromatase-mediated estrogen production. Androgens and aromatase inhibitors can induce female-to-male sex reversal, however, the mechanisms underlying gonadal masculinisation are poorly understood. We used histological analyses together with RNA sequencing to characterise zebrafish gonadal transcriptomes and investigate the effects of 17alpha-methyltestosterone on gonadal differentiation. RESULTS: At a morphological level, 17alpha-methyltestosterone (MT) masculinised gonads and accelerated spermatogenesis, and these changes were paralleled in masculinisation and de-feminisation of gonadal transcriptomes. MT treatment upregulated expression of genes involved in male sex determination and differentiation (amh, dmrt1, gsdf and wt1a) and those involved in 11-oxygenated androgen production (cyp11c1 and hsd11b2). It also repressed expression of ovarian development and folliculogenesis genes (bmp15, gdf9, figla, zp2.1 and zp3b). Furthermore, MT treatment altered epigenetic modification of histones in zebrafish gonads. Contrary to expectations, higher levels of cyp19a1a or foxl2 expression in control ovaries compared to MT-treated testes and control testes were not statistically significant during early gonad development (40 dpf). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that both androgen production and aromatase inhibition are important for androgen-induced gonadal masculinisation and natural testicular differentiation in zebrafish."

Epub 2017 Apr 8.,"Dead end (dnd), vertebrate-specific germ cell marker, had been demonstrated to be essential for primordial germ cell (PGC) migration and survival, and the link between PGC number and sex change had been revealed in some teleost species, but little is known about dnd in hermaphroditic vertebrates. In the present study, a protogynous hermaphroditic orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) dnd homologue (Ecdnd) was identified and characterized. Quantitative real-time PCR and in situ hybridization analysis revealed a dynamic and sexually dimorphic expression pattern in PGCs and germ cells of gonads. During sex changing, the Ecdnd transcript sharply increased in early transitional gonad, reached the highest level at late transitional gonad stage, and decreased after testis maturation. Visualization of zebrafish PGCs by injecting with RFP-Ecdnd-3'UTR RNA and GFP-zfnanos3-3'UTR RNA confirmed importance of Ecdnd 3'UTR for the PGC distribution. In addition, knockdown of EcDnd by using antisense morpholinos (MO) caused the ablation of PGCs in orange-spotted grouper. Therefore, the current data indicate that Ecdnd is essential for PGCs survival and may serve as a useful germ cell marker during gametogenesis in hermaphroditic grouper."
28398516,Functional Analysis of Nuclear Estrogen Receptors in Zebrafish Reproduction by Genome Editing Approach.,"Lu H, Cui Y, Jiang L, Ge W",Endocrinology. 2017 Jul 1;158(7):2292-2308. doi: 10.1210/en.2017-00215.,"Estrogens signal through both nuclear and membrane receptors with most reported effects being mediated via the nuclear estrogen receptors (nERs). Although much work has been reported on nERs in the zebrafish, there is a lack of direct genetic evidence for their functional roles and importance in reproduction. To address this issue, we undertook this study to disrupt all three nERs in the zebrafish, namely esr1 (ERalpha), esr2a (ERbetaII), and esr2b (ERbetaI), by the genome-editing technology clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and its associated nuclease (CRISPR/Cas9). Using this loss-of-function genetic approach, we successfully created three mutant zebrafish lines with each nER knocked out. In addition, we also generated all possible double and triple knockouts of the three nERs. The phenotypes of these mutants in reproduction were analyzed in all single, double, and triple nER knockouts in both females and males. Surprisingly, all three single nER mutant fish lines display normal reproductive development and function in both females and males, suggesting functional redundancy among these nERs. Further analysis of double and triple knockouts showed that nERs, especially Esr2a and Esr2b, were essential for female reproduction, and loss of these two nERs led to an arrest of folliculogenesis at previtellogenic stage II followed by sex reversal from female to male. In addition, the current study also revealed a unique role for Esr2a in follicle cell proliferation and transdifferentiation, follicle growth, and chorion formation. Taken together, this study provides the most comprehensive genetic analysis for differential functions of esr1, esr2a, and esr2b in fish reproduction."

Epub 2017 Feb 13.,"Foxl2 is essential for mammalian ovary maintenance. Although sexually dimorphic expression of foxl2 was observed in many teleosts, its role and regulative mechanism in fish remained largely unclear. In this study, we first identified two transcript variants of foxl2a and its homologous gene foxl2b in zebrafish, and revealed their specific expression in follicular layer cells in a sequential and divergent fashion during ovary differentiation, maturation, and maintenance. Then, homozygous foxl2a mutants (foxl2a(-/-)) and foxl2b mutants (foxl2b(-/-)) were constructed and detailed comparisons, such as sex ratio, gonadal histological structure, transcriptome profiling, and dynamic expression of gonadal development-related genes, were carried out. Initial ovarian differentiation and oocyte development occur normally both in foxl2a(-/-) and foxl2b(-/-) mutants, but foxl2a and foxl2b disruptions result in premature ovarian failure and partial sex reversal, respectively, in adult females. In foxl2a(-/-) female mutants, sox9a-amh/cyp19a1a signaling was upregulated at 150 days postfertilization (dpf) and subsequently oocyte apoptosis was triggered after 180 dpf. In contrast, dmrt1 expression was greater at 105 dpf and increased several 100-fold in foxl2b(-/-) mutated ovaries at 270 dpf, along with other testis-related genes. Finally, homozygous foxl2a(-/-)/foxl2b(-/-) double mutants were constructed in which complete sex reversal occurs early and testis-differentiation genes robustly increase at 60 dpf. Given mutual compensation between foxl2a and foxl2b in foxl2b(-/-) and foxl2a(-/-) mutants, we proposed a model in which foxl2a and foxl2b cooperate to regulate zebrafish ovary development and maintenance, with foxl2b potentially having a dominant role in preventing the ovary from differentiating as testis, as compared to foxl2a."

Epub 2017 Jan 23.,"Understanding environmental influences on sex ratios is important for the study of the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms and for evaluating the effects of global warming and chemical pollution. Fishes exhibit sexual plasticity, but the underlying mechanisms of environmental effects on their reproduction are unclear even in the well-established teleost research model, the zebrafish. Here we established the conditions to study the effects of elevated temperature on zebrafish sex. We showed that sex ratio response to elevated temperature is family-specific and typically leads to masculinization (female-to-male sex reversal), resulting in neomales. These results uncovered genotype-by-environment interactions that support a polygenic sex determination system in domesticated (laboratory) zebrafish. We found that some heat-treated fish had gene expression profiles similar to untreated controls of the same sex, indicating that they were resistant to thermal effects. Further, most neomales had gonadal transcriptomes similar to that of regular males. Strikingly, we discovered heat-treated females that displayed a normal ovarian phenotype but with a ""male-like"" gonadal transcriptome. Such major transcriptomic reprogramming with preserved organ structure has never been reported. Juveniles were also found to have a male-like transcriptome shortly after exposure to heat. These findings were validated by analyzing the expression of genes and signaling pathways associated with sex differentiation. Our results revealed a lasting thermal effect on zebrafish gonads, suggesting new avenues for detection of functional consequences of elevated temperature in natural fish populations in a global warming scenario."
27940159,Dmrt1 is necessary for male sexual development in zebrafish.,"Webster KA, Schach U, Ordaz A, Steinfeld JS, Draper BW, Siegfried KR",Dev Biol. 2017 Feb 1;422(1):33-46. doi: 10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.12.008. Epub 2016 Dec 8.,"The dmrt1 (doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1) gene is a key regulator of sex determination and/or gonadal sex differentiation across metazoan animals. This is unusual given that sex determination genes are typically not well conserved. The mechanisms by which zebrafish sex is determined have remained elusive due to the lack of sex chromosomes and the complex polygenic nature of sex determination in domesticated strains. To investigate the role of dmrt1 in zebrafish sex determination and gonad development, we isolated mutations disrupting this gene. We found that the majority of dmrt1 mutant fish develop as fertile females suggesting a complete male-to-female sex reversal in mutant animals that would have otherwise developed as males. A small percentage of mutant animals became males, but were sterile and displayed testicular dysgenesis. Therefore zebrafish dmrt1 functions in male sex determination and testis development. Mutant males had aberrant gonadal development at the onset of gonadal sex-differentiation, displaying reduced oocyte apoptosis followed by development of intersex gonads and failed testis morphogenesis and spermatogenesis. By contrast, female ovaries developed normally. We found that Dmrt1 is necessary for normal transcriptional regulation of the amh (anti-Mullerian hormone) and foxl2 (forkhead box L2) genes, which are thought to be important for male or female sexual development respectively. Interestingly, we identified one dmrt1 mutant allele that co-operates with a linked segregation distorter locus to generate an apparent XY sex determination mechanism. We conclude that dmrt1 is dispensable for ovary development but necessary for testis development in zebrafish, and that dmrt1 promotes male development by transcriptionally regulating male and female genes as has been described in other animals. Furthermore, the strong sex-ratio bias caused by dmrt1 reduction-of-function points to potential mechanisms through which sex chromosomes may evolve."
27383240,Perchlorate Exposure Reduces Primordial Germ Cell Number in Female Threespine Stickleback.,"Petersen AM, Earp NC, Redmond ME, Postlethwait JH, von Hippel FA, Buck CL, Cresko WA",PLoS One. 2016 Jul 6;11(7):e0157792. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0157792. eCollection 2016.,"Perchlorate is a common aquatic contaminant that has long been known to affect thyroid function in vertebrates, including humans. More recently perchlorate has been shown to affect primordial sexual differentiation in the aquatic model fishes zebrafish and threespine stickleback, but the mechanism has been unclear. Stickleback exposed to perchlorate from fertilization have increased androgen levels in the embryo and disrupted reproductive morphologies as adults, suggesting that perchlorate could disrupt the earliest stages of primordial sexual differentiation when primordial germ cells (PGCs) begin to form the gonad. Female stickleback have three to four times the number of PGCs as males during the first weeks of development. We hypothesized that perchlorate exposure affects primordial sexual differentiation by reducing the number of germ cells in the gonad during an important window of stickleback sex determination at 14-18 days post fertilization (dpf). We tested this hypothesis by quantifying the number of PGCs at 16 dpf in control and 100 mg/L perchlorate-treated male and female stickleback. Perchlorate exposure from the time of fertilization resulted in significantly reduced PGC number only in genotypic females, suggesting that the masculinizing effects of perchlorate observed in adult stickleback may result from early changes to the number of PGCs at a time critical for sex determination. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of a connection between an endocrine disruptor and reduction in PGC number prior to the first meiosis during sex determination. These findings suggest that a mode of action of perchlorate on adult reproductive phenotypes in vertebrates, including humans, such as altered fecundity and sex reversal or intersex gonads, may stem from early changes to germ cell development."

Epub 2016 Jun 3.,"Zebrafish (Danio rerio) sex determination seems to involve genetic factors (GSD) but also environmental factors (ESD), such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that are known to mimic endogenous hormones and disrupt gonad differentiation. Apoptosis has also been proposed to play a crucial role in zebrafish gonad differentiation. Nevertheless, the interactions between EDCs and apoptosis have received little attention. Thus, this study aimed to assess if and which apoptotic pathways are involved in zebrafish gonad differentiation and how EDCs may interfere with this process. With these purposes, zebrafish were exposed to 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2, 4ng/L) and fadrozole (Fad, 50mug/L) from 2h to 35days post-fertilization (dpf). Afterwards, a gene expression analysis by qRT-PCR and a stereological analysis, based on systematic sampling and protein immunohistochemistry, were performed. The death receptors (FAS; TRADD), anti-apoptotic (BCL-2; MDM2), pro-apoptotic (CASP-2 and -6) and cell proliferation (BIRC5/survivin; JUN) genes and proteins were evaluated. In general, apoptosis was inhibited in females through the involvement of anti-apoptotic pathways, while in males apoptosis seemed to be crucial to the failure of the ""juvenile ovary"" development and the induction of testes transformation. The JUN protein was shown to be necessary in juvenile ovaries, while the BIRC5 protein seemed to be involved in zebrafish spermatogenesis. Both EDCs, EE2 and Fad, increased the apoptosis stimulus in zebrafish gonad. It was noticed that the few females that were resistant to Fad-induced sex reversal had increased anti-apoptotic factor levels, while males exposed to EE2 showed increased pro-apoptotic genes/proteins and were more advanced in gonad differentiation. Overall, our findings show that apoptosis pathways are involved in zebrafish gonad differentiation and that EDCs can disrupt this process."

Epub 2016 Jun 4.,"Sex determinations are diverse in vertebrates. Although many sex-determining genes and pathways are conserved, the mechanistic roles of these genes and pathways in the genetic sex determination are not well understood. DAX1 (encoded by the NR0B1 gene) is a vertebrate specific orphan nuclear receptor that regulates gonadal development and sexual determination. In human, duplication of the NR0B1 gene leads to male-to-female sex reversal. In mice, Nr0b1 shows both pro-testis and anti-testis functions. We generated inheritable nr0b1 mutation in the zebrafish and found the nr0b1 mutation caused homozygous mutants to develop as fertile males due to female-to-male sex reversal. The nr0b1 mutation did not increase Caspase-3 labeling nor tp53 expression in the developing gonads. Introduction of a tp53 mutation into the nr0b1 mutant did not rescue the sex-reversal phenotype. Further examination revealed reduction in cell proliferation and abnormal somatic cell differentiation in the nr0b1 mutant gonads at the undifferentiated and bi-potential ovary stages. Together, our results suggest nr0b1 regulates somatic cell differentiation and cell proliferation to ensure normal sex development in the zebrafish."
27002526,Development and recovery of histopathological alterations in the gonads of zebrafish (Danio rerio) after single and combined exposure to endocrine disruptors (17alpha-ethinylestradiol and fadrozole).,"Luzio A, Monteiro SM, Rocha E, Fontainhas-Fernandes AA, Coimbra AM",Aquat Toxicol. 2016 Jun;175:90-105. doi: 10.1016/j.aquatox.2016.03.014. Epub 2016 Mar 16.,"Exposure of wildlife to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) is not necessarily continuous. Due to seasonal changes and variable industrial and agricultural activities it often occurs intermittently. Thus, it is possible that aquatic organisms may be more affected by periodic peak exposure than by chronic exposure. Therefore, an experimental scenario including an exposure from 2h to 90 days post-fertilization (dpf) and a subsequent recovery period until 150 dpf was chosen to assess the potential reversibility of the effects of sex steroids on sexual and gonad development of zebrafish (Danio rerio). The aim of this study was to investigate the persistence of the endocrine effects of an estrogen (EE2-17alpha-ethinylestradiol, 4ng/L), an inhibitor of estrogen synthesis (Fad-fadrozole, 50mug/L) or their binary mixture (Mix-EE2+ Fad, 4ng/L+50mug/L). Afterwards, a semi-quantitative histological assessment was used to investigate histopathological changes on gonad differentiation and development. The data showed that fadrozole, alone or in combination with EE2, permanently disrupts the sexual development, inducing masculinization and causing severe pathological alterations in testis, such as intersex associated to the enlargement of sperm ducts, interstitial changes, asynchronous development and detachment of basal membrane. After exposures to both EDCs and their mixture, the gonad histopathology revealed interstitial proteinaceous fluid deposits and, in ovaries, there were atretic oocytes, and presumably degenerative mineralization. On the other hand, the gonadal changes induced by EE2 alone seem to be partially reversible when the exposure regime changed to a recovery period. In addition, EE2 enhanced zebrafish growth in both genders, with male fish presenting signs of early obesity such as the presence of adipocytes in testis. Moreover, sex ratio was slightly skewed toward females, at 90 and 105 dpf, in zebrafish exposed to EE2. The data further indicate that long-term studies on impacts of single EDCs and their mixtures with recovery periods are crucial to reveal the possibility of sex reversal and pathological changes of gonads that can adversely affect breeding."

However, the proximate effects of sex-role reversal are largely unknown. Endocrine disruptors provide an experimental mechanism to address hormonal regulation of sexually dimorphic gene expression in sex-role-reversed taxa. Here, we investigate gene expression patterns in the liver of the sex-role-reversed Gulf pipefish, because the liver is known to be sexually dimorphic and estrogen-regulated in species with conventional sex roles. Using next-generation RNA-sequencing technology (RNA-seq), we detected sexually dimorphic hepatic gene expression patterns, with a total of 482 differentially expressed genes between the sexes in Gulf pipefish. Two-thirds of these genes were over-expressed in females, and the sex-specific transcriptomes of this sex-role-reversed pipefish's liver were superficially similar to those of fishes with conventional sex-roles. We exposed females, pregnant males, and non-pregnant males to 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) at ecologically relevant concentrations of 5ng/L and compared gene expression patterns in the livers of exposed fish to control fish. Several genes that were up-regulated in EE2-exposed males relative to control males were also found to be female-biased in control animals. These genes included several of the classic estrogen biomarkers, such as vitellogenin, choriogenin, and zona pellucida. Thus, estrogen exposure induced feminization of the male liver transcriptome in a sex-role-reversed pipefish. These results suggest that the ancestral state of estrogen-regulated female reproductive physiology has been retained in all sex-role-reversed vertebrates thus far studied, despite substantial evolution of the hormonal regulation of ornamentation and mating behavior in these interesting taxa."

Epub 2015 Jun 30.,"Synthetic progestins have become widespread environmental contaminants and may cause adverse effects on fish. In the present study, we investigated the effects of levonorgestrel (LNG) on sex differentiation in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Embryos were exposed to LNG at environmentally relevant concentrations (0, 1, 10, 33, and 100ng/L) and allowed to develop until sexual maturity. Histological examination at 63 days post fertilization (dpf) caused complete sex reversal and 100% males were observed in the 10, 33 and 100ng/L treatments; gross morphological and histological examination of gonads at 142dpf further confirmed 100% males at these exposure concentrations. The results indicate androgenic activity of LNG, and masculinization during zebrafish gonadal differentiation. The mRNA expression levels of genes involved in fish sex differentiation and gonadal development were examined at 28 and 42dpf. Down-regulation of the mRNA expression of aromatase (e.g., cyp19a1a, cyp19a1b), the forkhead transcription factor gene L2 (foxl2) and the Fushi tarazu factor-1d (nr5a1b) were observed. In contrast, transcription of the doublesex and mab-3-related transcription factor 1 (dmrt1) gene was up-regulated. Androgen receptor (ar) mRNA expression was significantly down-regulated at 28 and 42dpf. Co-exposure to flutamide (an androgen antagonist) and LNG, led to a decrease in the sex inversion potency of LNG. Our study has demonstrated that environmentally relevant concentrations of LNG could alter sex differentiation and gonadal development in zebrafish. Our results also suggest a potentially high ecological risk of LNG to fish populations in LNG-contaminated aquatic environments."

Epub 2015 May 20.,"Gonadotropins are primary hormones that control vertebrate reproduction. In a recent study, we analyzed the impacts of FSH and LH on zebrafish reproduction by disrupting FSH and LH-beta genes (fshb and lhb) using transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) technology. Using the same approach, we successfully deleted FSH and LH receptor genes (fshr and lhcgr) in the present study. In contrast to the deficiency of its cognate ligand FSH, the fshr-deficient females showed a complete failure of follicle activation with all ovarian follicles arrested at the primary growth-previtellogenic transition, which is the marker for puberty onset in females. Interestingly, after blockade at the primary growth stage for varying times, all females reversed to males, and all these males were fertile. In fshr-deficient males, spermatogenesis was normal in adults, but the initiation of spermatogenesis in juveniles was retarded. In contrast to fshr, the deletion of the lhcgr gene alone caused no obvious phenotypes in both males and females; however, double mutation of fshr and lhcgr resulted in infertile males. In summary, our results in the present study showed that Fshr was indispensable to folliculogenesis and the disruption of the fshr gene resulted in a complete failure of follicle activation followed by masculinization into males. In contrast, lhcgr does not seem to be essential to zebrafish reproduction in both males and females. Neither Fshr nor Lhcgr deficiency could phenocopy the deficiency of their cognate ligands FSH and LH, which is likely due to the fact that Fshr can be activated by both FSH and LH in the zebrafish."

Epub 2014 Sep 18.,"Sex determination can be robustly genetic, strongly environmental, or genetic subject to environmental perturbation. The genetic basis of sex determination is unknown for zebrafish (Danio rerio), a model for development and human health. We used RAD-tag population genomics to identify sex-linked polymorphisms. After verifying this ""RAD-sex"" method on medaka (Oryzias latipes), we studied two domesticated zebrafish strains (AB and TU), two natural laboratory strains (WIK and EKW), and two recent isolates from nature (NA and CB). All four natural strains had a single sex-linked region at the right tip of chromosome 4, enabling sex genotyping by PCR. Genotypes for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with the strongest statistical association to sex suggested that wild zebrafish have WZ/ZZ sex chromosomes. In natural strains, ""male genotypes"" became males and some ""female genotypes"" also became males, suggesting that the environment or genetic background can cause female-to-male sex reversal. Surprisingly, TU and AB lacked detectable sex-linked loci. Phylogenomics rooted on D. nigrofasciatus verified that all strains are monophyletic. Because AB and TU branched as a monophyletic clade, we could not rule out shared loss of the wild sex locus in a common ancestor despite their independent domestication. Mitochondrial DNA sequences showed that investigated strains represent only one of the three identified zebrafish haplogroups. Results suggest that zebrafish in nature possess a WZ/ZZ sex-determination mechanism with a major determinant lying near the right telomere of chromosome 4 that was modified during domestication. Strains providing the zebrafish reference genome lack key components of the natural sex-determination system but may have evolved variant sex-determining mechanisms during two decades in laboratory culture."
24263104,Sox9-related signaling controls zebrafish juvenile ovary-testis transformation.,"Sun D, Zhang Y, Wang C, Hua X, Zhang XA, Yan J",Cell Death Dis. 2013 Nov 21;4:e930. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.456.,"In almost all vertebrates, the downstream of the sox9 signaling axis is well conserved for testis differentiation. The upstream genes of this pathway vary from species to species during evolution. Yet, little is known about how these signaling cascades are regulated and what cellular processes are dominant in ovary-testis transformation in juvenile zebrafish. In this study, we find that the transforming gonads undergo activation of sox9a-expressing stromal cells with increased deposition of extracellular matrix and formation of degenerative compartments. This leads to follicle disassembly, oocyte degeneration, follicle cell-cyp19a1a-amh conversions, and, eventually, formation of the testis cord. In vitro primary culture of juvenile ovary tissue in gonadotropins increases cytoplasmic accumulation of sox9a and p-Erk1/2, and induces mesenchymal morphology. MAPK inhibitors (MKI), a mixture of PD98059 and U0216, eliminate the cytoplasmic distribution but do not eradicate nuclear localization of sox9a and p-Erk1/2. Nuclear p53 are relatively increased in MKI-treated cells that exhibit less spreading and reduced proliferation. Despite uniform nuclear condensation, only a fraction of cells displayed the apoptotic phenotype. These results suggest that high levels of cytoplasmic sox9a and p-Erk1/2 activity activate stromal cells and enhance the production of extracellular matrix required for testis cord formation, whereas deregulation and translocation of sox9a and p-Erk1/2 induce follicle disassembly and incomplete apoptosis associated with nuclear p53. Together with the established FSH/cAMP/MAPK/AMH pathway in mammalian granulosa and Sertoli cells, we demonstrated that the sox9 axis signaling that determines testis formation in mammals also induces zebrafish ovary-testis transition, and adds to its conserved role in sex reversal."

Epub 2013 Oct 2.,"Gene targeting is a powerful tool for analyzing gene function. Recently, new technology for gene targeting using engineered zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) has been described in fish species. However, it has not yet been widely used for cold water and slow developing species, such as Salmonidae. Here, we present the results of successful ZFN-mediated disruption of the sex-determining gene sdY (sexually dimorphic on the Y chromosome) in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Three pairs of ZFN mRNA targeted to different regions of the sdY gene were injected into fertilized rainbow trout eggs. Sperm from 1-year-old male founders (parental generation one or P1) carrying a ZFN-induced mutation in their germline were then used to produce F1 non-mosaic animals. In these F1 populations, we characterized 14 different mutations in the sdY gene, including one mutation leading to the deletion of leucine 43 (L43) and 13 mutations at other target sites that had different effects on the SdY protein, i.e., amino acid insertions, deletions, and frameshift mutations producing premature stop codons in the mRNA. The gonadal phenotype analysis of the F1-mutated animals revealed that the single L43 amino acid deletion did not lead to a male-to-female sex reversal, but all other mutations induced a clear ovarian phenotype. These results show that targeted gene disruption using ZFN is efficient in rainbow trout but depends on the ZFN design. We also characterized new sdY mutations resulting in male-to-female sex reversal, and we conclude that L43 seems dispensable for SdY function."

Epub 2012 Jul 21.,"The presence of germ cells in the early gonad is important for sexual fate determination and gonadal development in vertebrates. Recent studies in zebrafish and medaka have shown that a lack of germ cells in the early gonad induces sex reversal in favor of a male phenotype. However, it is uncertain whether the gonadal somatic cells or the germ cells are predominant in determining gonadal fate in other vertebrate. Here, we investigated the role of germ cells in gonadal differentiation in goldfish, a gonochoristic species that possesses an XX-XY genetic sex determination system. The primordial germ cells (PGCs) of the fish were eliminated during embryogenesis by injection of a morpholino oligonucleotide against the dead end gene. Fish without germ cells showed two types of gonadal morphology: one with an ovarian cavity; the other with seminiferous tubules. Next, we tested whether function could be restored to these empty gonads by transplantation of a single PGC into each embryo, and also determined the gonadal sex of the resulting germline chimeras. Transplantation of a single GFP-labeled PGC successfully produced a germline chimera in 42.7% of the embryos. Some of the adult germline chimeras had a developed gonad on one side that contained donor derived germ cells, while the contralateral gonad lacked any early germ cell stages. Female germline chimeras possessed a normal ovary and a germ-cell free ovary-like structure on the contralateral side; this structure was similar to those seen in female morphants. Male germline chimeras possessed a testis and a contralateral empty testis that contained some sperm in the tubular lumens. Analysis of aromatase, foxl2 and amh expression in gonads of morphants and germline chimeras suggested that somatic transdifferentiation did not occur. The offspring of fertile germline chimeras all had the donor-derived phenotype, indicating that germline replacement had occurred and that the transplanted PGC had rescued both female and male gonadal function. These findings suggest that the absence of germ cells did not affect the pathway for ovary or testis development and that phenotypic sex in goldfish is determined by somatic cells under genetic sex control rather than an interaction between the germ cells and somatic cells."

Bone marrow transplants improve hematopoietic phenotypes but do not prevent other cancers. FA arises from mutation in any of the 15 FANC genes that cooperate to repair double stranded DNA breaks by homologous recombination. Zebrafish has a single ortholog of each human FANC gene and unexpectedly, mutations in at least two of them (fancl and fancd1(brca2)) lead to female-to-male sex reversal. Investigations show that, as in human, zebrafish fanc genes are required for genome stability and for suppressing apoptosis in tissue culture cells, in embryos treated with DNA damaging agents, and in meiotic germ cells. The sex reversal phenotype requires the action of Tp53 (p53), an activator of apoptosis. These results suggest that in normal sex determination, zebrafish oocytes passing through meiosis signal the gonadal soma to maintain expression of aromatase, an enzyme that converts androgen to estrogen, thereby feminizing the gonad and the individual. According to this model, normal male and female zebrafish differ in genetic factors that control the strength of the late meiotic oocyte-derived signal, probably by regulating the number of meiotic oocytes, which environmental factors can also alter. Transcripts from fancd1(brca2) localize at the animal pole of the zebrafish oocyte cytoplasm and are required for normal oocyte nuclear architecture, for normal embryonic development, and for preventing ovarian tumors. Embryonic DNA repair and sex reversal phenotypes provide assays for the screening of small molecule libraries for therapeutic substances for FA."

Both genetic and temperature-dependent systems of sex determination have been described in teleost fish. In the common zebrafish model organism, heteromorphic sex chromosomes are not observed, and the potential role of a genetic component of sex determination remains largely unknown. Here we report a genome-wide linkage study of sex determination in zebrafish using a novel SNP genetic map. We identified loci on zebrafish chromosomes 5 (LOD score 7.9) and 16 (LOD score 9.3) governing sex determination as a complex trait, rather than as an XY or ZW genetic system. Each of these loci contains a prominent candidate gene with a conserved role in sex determination across additional species that suggest potential mechanisms of sex determination in zebrafish. The chromosome 5 locus harbors dmrt1, a key gene in sex determination from fruit flies to humans; mutation of the human DMRT1 ortholog is a cause of complete sex reversal of XY individuals. The chromosome 16 locus harbors cyp21a2; mutation of the human CYP21A2 ortholog is one of the more common causes of pseudohermaphroditism. Mutation detection at each of these candidate genes within the zebrafish cross identified hypomorphic variants on the female-associated allele of each locus. The two loci together accounted for 16% of variance of the trait. Interacting environmental cues are likely to be an additional important component of sex determination in zebrafish."

Epub 2011 Mar 31.,"Mild mutations in BRCA2 (FANCD1) cause Fanconi anemia (FA) when homozygous, while severe mutations cause common cancers including breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers when heterozygous. Here we report a zebrafish brca2 insertional mutant that shares phenotypes with human patients and identifies a novel brca2 function in oogenesis. Experiments showed that mutant embryos and mutant cells in culture experienced genome instability, as do cells in FA patients. In wild-type zebrafish, meiotic cells expressed brca2; and, unexpectedly, transcripts in oocytes localized asymmetrically to the animal pole. In juvenile brca2 mutants, oocytes failed to progress through meiosis, leading to female-to-male sex reversal. Adult mutants became sterile males due to the meiotic arrest of spermatocytes, which then died by apoptosis, followed by neoplastic proliferation of gonad somatic cells that was similar to neoplasia observed in ageing dead end (dnd)-knockdown males, which lack germ cells. The construction of animals doubly mutant for brca2 and the apoptotic gene tp53 (p53) rescued brca2-dependent sex reversal. Double mutants developed oocytes and became sterile females that produced only aberrant embryos and showed elevated risk for invasive ovarian tumors. Oocytes in double-mutant females showed normal localization of brca2 and pou5f1 transcripts to the animal pole and vasa transcripts to the vegetal pole, but had a polarized rather than symmetrical nucleus with the distribution of nucleoli and chromosomes to opposite nuclear poles; this result revealed a novel role for Brca2 in establishing or maintaining oocyte nuclear architecture. Mutating tp53 did not rescue the infertility phenotype in brca2 mutant males, suggesting that brca2 plays an essential role in zebrafish spermatogenesis. Overall, this work verified zebrafish as a model for the role of Brca2 in human disease and uncovered a novel function of Brca2 in vertebrate oocyte nuclear architecture."

However even for model fish species like the zebrafish Danio rerio the precise mechanisms involved in primary sex determination have not been studied extensively. The zebrafish, a gonochoristic species, is lacking discernible sex chromosomes and the sex of juvenile fish is difficult to determine. Sequential protandrous hermaphrodite species provide distinct determination of the gender and allow studying the sex determination process by looking at the mechanism of sex reversal. This is the first attempt to understand the genetic basis of phenotypic variation for sex determination and body weight in a sequential protandrous hermaphrodite species, the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). This work demonstrates a fast and efficient strategy for Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) detection in the gilthead sea bream, a non-model but target hermaphrodite fish species. Therefore a comparative mapping approach was performed to query syntenies against two other Perciformes, the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), a gonochoristic species and the Asian sea bass (Lates calcarifer) a protandrous hermaphrodite. In this manner two significant QTLs, one QTL affecting both body weight and sex and one QTL affecting sex, were detected on the same linkage group. The co-segregation of the two QTLs provides a genomic base to the observed genetic correlation between these two traits in sea bream as well as in other teleosts. The identification of QTLs linked to sex reversal and growth, will contribute significantly to a better understanding of the complex nature of sex determination in S. aurata where most individuals reverse to the female sex at the age of two years through development and maturation of the ovarian portion of the gonad and regression of the testicular area.

The present study investigated the androgenic sex reversal of zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to the androgenic compound 17beta-trenbolone (TB) and whether sex-changed females would revert to the female phenotype after cessation of TB exposure. 17beta-Trenbolone is a metabolite of trenbolone acetate, an anabolic steroid used as a growth promoter in beef cattle. 17beta-Trenbolone in runoff from cattle feedlots may reach concentrations that affect fish sexual development. Zebrafish were exposed to a concentration of 20 ng/L TB in a flow-through system for five months from egg until sexual maturity. This resulted in an all-male population. It was further found that all these phenotypic males displayed normal male courtship behavior and were able to reproduce successfully, implying that the sex reversal was complete and functional. None of the phenotypic males developed into females after six months in clean water, demonstrating that androgenic sex reversal of zebrafish is irreversible."

We identified a mutation in the zebrafish fancl gene that causes homozygous mutants to develop as fertile males due to female-to-male sex reversal. Fancl is a member of the Fanconi Anemia/BRCA DNA repair pathway. Experiments showed that zebrafish fancl was expressed in developing germ cells in bipotential gonads at the critical time of sexual fate determination. Caspase-3 immunoassays revealed increased germ cell apoptosis in fancl mutants that compromised oocyte survival. In the absence of oocytes surviving through meiosis, somatic cells of mutant gonads did not maintain expression of the ovary gene cyp19a1a and did not down-regulate expression of the early testis gene amh; consequently, gonads masculinized and became testes. Remarkably, results showed that the introduction of a tp53 (p53) mutation into fancl mutants rescued the sex-reversal phenotype by reducing germ cell apoptosis and, thus, allowed fancl mutants to become fertile females. Our results show that Fancl function is not essential for spermatogonia and oogonia to become sperm or mature oocytes, but instead suggest that Fancl function is involved in the survival of developing oocytes through meiosis. This work reveals that Tp53-mediated germ cell apoptosis induces sex reversal after the mutation of a DNA-repair pathway gene by compromising the survival of oocytes and suggests the existence of an oocyte-derived signal that biases gonad fate towards the female developmental pathway and thereby controls zebrafish sex determination."

Among these, comparison between medaka and zebrafish is of special interest, because zebrafish is an undifferentiated gonochorist that, nevertheless, shares many similarities with medaka and is also used as a small fish model for developmental biology. Accordingly, here we focus on the comparative aspects of gonadal development in medaka and zebrafish. In medaka, oogenesis begins in female gonads, whereas oogenesis is suppressed and germ cells remain in an undifferentiated state in male gonads. In zebrafish, oogenesis begins in all individuals, regardless of their future sex, while actual sex differentiation begins later in gonadal development, which means that degeneration of immature oocytes occurs in presumptive males, while oogenesis proceeds to completion in presumptive females. Despite these apparent differences between medaka and zebrafish, the process of gonadal development comprises similar stages: early oogenesis, early aromatase expression, later oocyte development or loss, sexually dimorphic expression of somatic genes, and spermatogenesis. We propose the concept of canalization as a key to gaining a comprehensive understanding of gonadal sex differentiation. In this respect, the possible role of the male-determining gene DMY/dmrt1bY is also discussed."
16459120,Identification of a novel C2 domain factor in ovaries of orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides).,"Ji GD, Zhou L, Wang Y, Xia W, Gui JF",Comp Biochem Physiol B Biochem Mol Biol. 2006 Mar;143(3):374-83. doi: 10.1016/j.cbpb.2005.12.012. Epub 2006 Feb 3.,"Follicle consists of an oocyte and a lot of surrounding follicular cells, and significant interactions exist between the oocyte and the somatic cells. In this study, a novel cDNA has been screened from a subtractive cDNA library between tail bud embryos and blastula embryos in the protogynous hermaphrodite orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides). Its full-length cDNA is 821 bp, and has an ORF of 414 bp for encoding a peptide of 137 aa, which shows 38%, 37%, 33%, and 33% homology with 4 putative proteins screened from zebrafish (Danio rerio). Conserved domain search in NCBI reveals a single C2 domain existing in the C2 domain superfamily proteins, and has only 7 beta strands in comparison with 8 beta strands of C2 domains in other C2 domain superfamily proteins. Artificial sex reversal, RT-PCR analysis and Western blot detection demonstrated ovary-specific expression of the C2 domain factor, and therefore the novel gene was designated as E. coioides ovary-specific C2 domain factor, EcOC2 factor. Moreover, predominant expression of EcOC2 factor was further revealed in grouper mature ovary, and its strong immunofluorescence signals were located between granulosa cells and oocyte zona radiata in grouper mature follicles. The data indicate that the novel EcOC2 factor might be a main component that associates between granulosa cells and the oocyte during oocyte maturation, and might play significant roles in regulating oocyte maturation and ovulation. Further studies on its developmental behaviour and physiological functions will elucidate the interactions between oocyte and the surrounding somatic cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms."

This is usually determined genetically; however it is a delicate process, which in many cases can be influenced by environmental factors. The mechanisms controlling zebrafish sex determination and differentiation are not known. To date no sex linked genes have been identified in zebrafish and no sex chromosomes have been identified. However, a number of genes, as presented here, have been linked to the process of sex determination or differentiation in zebrafish. The zebrafish FTZ-F1 genes are of central interest as they are involved in regulating interrenal development and thereby steroid biosynthesis, as well as that they show expression patterns congruent with reproductive tissue differentiation and function. Zebrafish can be sex reversed by exposure to estrogens, suggesting that the estrogen levels are crucial during sex differentiation. The Cyp19 gene product aromatase converts testosterone into 17 beta-estradiol, and when inhibited leads to male to female sex reversal. FTZ-F1 genes are strongly linked to steroid biosynthesis and the regulatory region of Cyp19 contains binding sites for FTZ-F1 genes, further linking FTZ-F1 to this process. The role of FTZ-F1 and other candidates for zebrafish sex determination and differentiation is in focus of this review."
15196702,Differential expression of thyroid-stimulating hormone beta subunit in gonads during sex reversal of orange-spotted and red-spotted groupers.,"Wang Y, Zhou L, Yao B, Li CJ, Gui JF",Mol Cell Endocrinol. 2004 May 31;220(1-2):77-88. doi: 10.1016/j.mce.2004.03.007.,"We have cloned and characterized the full-length cDNA encoding thyroid-stimulating hormone beta-subunit (TSHbeta) from orange-spotted grouper Epinephelus coioides. It contains 913 nucleotides with an open reading frame encoding 146 amino acids with a 20 amino acid signal peptide. The grouper mature TSHbeta has 75, 70, 61, 59, 41, 42 and 40% identities to that of rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon, zebrafish, European eel, chicken, mouse and human, respectively. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the TSHbeta mRNA was expressed abundantly not only in pituitary but also in gonads. A more interesting finding is to reveal the differential TSHbeta expressions between the ovaries and the transitional gonads or testes in natural individuals of orange-spotted grouper and red-spotted grouper Epinephelus akaara, and in artificial sex reversal individuals of red-spotted grouper induced by MT feeding. In situ hybridization localization provided direct evidence that the TSHbeta was transcribed in the germ cells. In the growing oocytes, the TSHbeta transcripts were concentrated on the ooplasm periphery. In testicular tissues, the intensively expressed TSHbeta cells were found to be spermatogonia and spermatocytes in the spermatogenic cysts. This is the first report of a TSHbeta expressed in the gonads of any vertebrates in addition to the expected expression in the pituitary, and it expresses more transcripts in the gonads during sex reversal or testis than in the ovaries both in E. coioides and E. akaara. Importantly, the TSHbeta identification in germ cells allows us to further investigate the functional roles and the molecular mechanisms in gametogenesis of groupers, especially in sex reversal and in spermatogenesis."
14720586,An aromatase inhibitor or high water temperature induce oocyte apoptosis and depletion of P450 aromatase activity in the gonads of genetic female zebrafish during sex-reversal.,"Uchida D, Yamashita M, Kitano T, Iguchi T",Comp Biochem Physiol A Mol Integr Physiol. 2004 Jan;137(1):11-20. doi: 10.1016/s1095-6433(03)00178-8.,"Dietary administration of a cytochrome P450 aromatase (P450arom) inhibitor (fadrozole) in genetic female juveniles of zebrafish (Danio rerio) was performed at 15-40 days post-hatching. The percentage of gonadal masculinization in the genetic all-females at 40 days post-hatching, treated with 0, 10, 100 and 1000 microg fadrozole g(-1) diet(-1) were 0, 62.5, 100 and 100%, respectively. Rearing at high water temperature in genetic all-females was performed at 15-25 days post-hatching. The percentage of gonadal masculinization in the genetic all-females at 40 days post-hatching, at water temperatures of 28.5, 35 and 37 degrees C were 0, 68.8 and 100%, respectively. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive oocytes of early diplotene and perinucleolar stages in fadrozole-treated genetic females (1000 microg g(-1) diet(-1)) were observed at 15-40 days post-hatching during sex-reversal. In contrast, apoptotic oocytes of early diplotene stage in high temperature-treated genetic females (at 35 and 37 degrees C) during sex-reversal and presumptive males of wild-type fish during sex differentiation were found at 15-27 days post-hatching. Our findings indicate that oocyte apoptosis, depletion of P450arom activity and differentiation of spermatogonia during gonadal sex-reversal are caused by treatments of aromatase inhibitor or high water temperature."
14684994,The rice field eel as a model system for vertebrate sexual development.,"Cheng H, Guo Y, Yu Q, Zhou R",Cytogenet Genome Res. 2003;101(3-4):274-7. doi: 10.1159/000074348.,"Complex developmental mechanisms of vertebrates are unraveled using comparative genomic approaches. Several teleosts, such as zebrafish, medaka and pufferfish, are used as genetic model systems because they are amenable to studies of gene function. The rice field eel, a freshwater fish, is emerging as a specific model system for studies of vertebrate sexual development because of its small genome size and naturally occurring sex reversal. Data presented here support the use of the rice field eel as another important fish model for comparative genome studies, especially in vertebrate sexual development. This model system is complementary rather than redundant."

Exposure to EE2 (1-25 ng/l) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in vitellogenin production starting at 2 ng/l. Significant changes in sex ratios in female direction were detected at 1 ng/l, with complete sex reversal taking place after exposure to 2 ng/l. No intersex fish were observed after exposure to EE2. Exposure to MT resulted in decreased vitellogenin concentrations. Complete sex reversal was detected in all MT concentrations used (26-1000 ng/l). A large proportion of intersex fish was observed after exposure to 1000 ng MT/l. The period of gonadal sex reversal in non-exposed zebrafish was also studied. The main morphological features of the transformation of ovaries into testis were observed 4-5 weeks after hatching."
12900561,"Sex determination and sex chromosome evolution in the medaka, Oryzias latipes, and the platyfish, Xiphophorus maculatus.","Volff JN, Schartl M",Cytogenet Genome Res. 2002;99(1-4):170-7. doi: 10.1159/000071590.,"The first vertebrate master sex-determining gene different from Sry has been very recently discovered in a small aquarium fish, the medaka (Oryzias latipes). In this fish, the X and Y chromosomes apparently differ only by a 250-kb Y-specific region containing dmrt1bY (also called DMY and dmrt1Y), a male-specific copy of the autosomal gene dmrt1. Dmrt1 is a putative transcription factor probably involved in testis formation in different vertebrate lineages. Dmrt1bY is the only gene having escaped the drastic process of degeneration that devastated the small Y-specific region of the medaka. Mutations leading to truncation or lower expression of dmrt1bY result in XY male-to-female sex reversal. Hence, both genetic and functional evidences converge in making dmrt1bY an outstanding candidate for the function of a master sex-determining gene in fish. Nevertheless, dmrt1bY could not be detected in certain other Oryzias species or in more divergent fishes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the duplication of the autosomal dmrt1 that formed dmrt1bY is young in evolutionary terms. Hence, dmrt1bY is not the universal master sex-determining gene in fish. Because the classical fish models, such as zebrafish and pufferfish, are not very adequate to study the basis of genetic sex determination, alternative models, such as the platyfish (Xiphophorus maculatus), are re-emerging. In this fish, which is a well-suited laboratory organism, gene loci involved in pigmentation, melanoma formation, and sexual maturity have been mapped close to the master sex-determining gene. Interestingly, the platyfish can harbor three different sex chromosomes (W, X, and Y) in certain natural populations. Bacterial artificial chromosome contigs covering the sex-determining region of the platyfish are already available, and the positional cloning of the master sex-determining gene(s) should provide new insights into sex determination and sex chromosome evolution in fish and other vertebrates."

Vitellogenin was measured in whole body homogenate 30 dph by ELISA and sex ratio was determined 60 dph by histological examination of the gonads. All exposure periods significantly induced vitellogenin synthesis and affected the sex differentiation leading to development of ovo-testis or complete feminisation of the exposed fish depending on exposure period. Complete sex reversal was obtained in groups exposed from 20 to 60 dph and hatch to 60 dph. The half-life for degradation of vitellogenin was calculated. Juvenile zebrafish were exposed to 15.4+/-1.4 ng EE2/l (actual concentration) from fertilisation to 25 dph and transferred to clean water, after which weekly measurements of vitellogenin concentration in whole body homogenate were performed until day 46 post hatch. The half-life of vitellogenin was 2.4 days."

Epub 2002 Apr 18.,"Sox9 is a transcription factor related to campomelic dysplasia and sex reversal in human patients. Earlier studies in zebrafish led to the identification of two homologues of mammalian sox9, sox9a and sox9b. The present study represents the first evaluation of expression patterns of zebrafish sox9b during early embryogenesis. Our analyses reveal that sox9b transcripts are present throughout the life-cycle of the zebrafish, but exhibit tissue-specific distribution during embryogenesis. Zygotic expression of sox9b occurs in the anterolateral margins and the midline of the prospective dorsal neuroectoderm during late gastrulation. During early segmentation, the transcript is expressed in pairs of longitudinal bands in the prospective midbrain, hindbrain, and trunk, which identify the cranial and trunk neural crest progenitors. Neural crest cells cease expression of sox9b during migration, but some of their derivatives resume sox9b expression. Sox9b can serve as a marker for neural crest precursors."

They are identified by a DNA-binding homology motif, the DM domain, and constitute a gene family (DMRTs). Unlike the invertebrate genes, whose role in the sex-determination process is essentially understood, the function of the different vertebrate DMRT genes is not as clear. Evidence has accumulated for the involvement of DMRT1 in male sex determination and differentiation. DMRT2 (known as terra in zebrafish) seems to be a critical factor for somitogenesis. To contribute to a better understanding of the function of this important gene family, we have analyzed DMRT1, DMRT2, and DMRT3 from the genome model organism Fugu rubripes and the medakafish, a complementary model organism for genetics and functional studies. We found conservation of synteny of human chromosome 9 in F. rubripes and an identical gene cluster organization of the DMRTs in both fish. Although expression analysis and gene linkage mapping in medaka exclude a function for any of the three genes in the primary step of male sex determination, comparison of F. rubripes and human sequences uncovered three putative regulatory regions that might have a role in more downstream events of sex determination and human XY sex reversal."

At present almost 30 Sox genes have been identified. Members of this family have been shown to be conserved during evolution and to play key roles during animal development. Some are involved in human diseases, including sex reversal. Here we report the isolation of a novel member of the Sox gene family, Sox30, which may constitute a distinct subgroup of this family. Using a bacterially expressed DNA-binding domain of Sox30, we show that it is able to specifically recognize the ACAAT motif. Furthermore, Sox30 is capable of activating transcription from a synthetic promoter containing the ACAAT motif. The specific expression of Sox30 in normal testes, but not in maturing germ cell-deficient testes, suggests the involvement of Sox30 in differentiation of male germ cells. Mapping analyses revealed that the Sox30 gene is located on human chromosome 5 (5q33) and on mouse chromosome 11."
