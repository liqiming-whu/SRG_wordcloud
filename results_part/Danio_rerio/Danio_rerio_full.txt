The 17 alpha methyltestosterone (MT) hormone is fed to Oreochromis niloticus larvae in fish farms with the purpose of inducing sex reversal. The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity and sub-lethality of MT (99.9% purity) and cMT (a commercial MT with 90% purity) in zebrafish (Danio rerio) adults, where the animals were exposed to concentrations of 0, 4, 23, 139, 833 and 5000 µg/L for 96 hours. Genotoxicity was evaluated by micronucleus test (MN), nuclear abnormalities (NA) and comet assay. A low genotoxic potential of MT was showed, inducing micronucleus, nuclear abnormalities and DNA damage in Danio rerio, depending on the use of MT or cMT, gender and tested concentrations. In the sub-lethality trials, there was a basal difference in the activity of the enzymatic biochemical markers for males and females, while the Glutatione S transferase (GST) activity decreased in all analyzed tissues, and for males the enzymatic activity decreased only in the intestine. Results suggest that MT has a toxic potential to fish because it alters enzymatic metabolic pathways and may pose a risk to the ecosystems.Article Purchase

However, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) could direct juvenile zebrafish sex differentiation to male and even induce ovary-to-testis reversal in adult zebrafish.In order to determine the transcriptomic changes of sex differentiation in juvenile zebrafish and early sex-reversal in adult zebrafish, we sequenced the transcriptomes of juvenile and adult zebrafish treated with AI exemestane (EM) for 32 days, when juvenile zebrafish sex differentiation finished. EM treatment in females up-regulated the expression of genes involved in estrogen metabolic process, female gamete generation and oogenesis, including gsdf, macf1a and paqr5a, while down-regulated the expression of vitellogenin (vtg) genes, including vtg6, vtg2, vtg4, and vtg7 due to the lower level of Estradiol (E2). Furthermore, EM-juveniles showed up-regulation in genes related to cell death and apoptosis, such as bcl2l16 and anax1c, while the control-juveniles exhibited up-regulation of genes involved in positive regulation of reproductive process and oocyte differentiation such as zar1 and zpcx. Moreover, EM-females showed higher enrichment than control females in genes involved in VEGF signaling pathway, glycosaminoglycan degradation, hedgehog signaling pathway, GnRH signaling pathway and steroid hormone biosynthesis.Our study shows anti-masculinization in EM-treated adult females but not in EM-treated juveniles. This may be responsible for the lower sex plasticity in adults than juveniles.Although zebrafish is an important model species for biomedical research, its early sex differentiation genes are still unclear. Currently, the zebrafish domesticated in the laboratory is widely considered to lack sex chromosomes [1], and its sex is determined by multiple genes and largely influenced by the environment [2, 3]. As the sex of zebrafish cannot be clearly determined by morphology until 3 months post fertilization as adults, the early sex differentiation genes cannot be identified directly by comparison of genes between juvenile females and males [4].Directed sex differentiation in the juvenile stage may provide a solution to the problem of finding early sex differentiation genes. Fish has sex plasticity and sex differentiation can be directed using sex steroids [5]. Estrogen and androgen are important to female and male differentiation, respectively. Estradiol (E2), the most effective endogenous estrogen, is biosynthesized from androgen by cytochrome P450 aromatase mainly encoded by cyp19a1a/b in fish [6]. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) can thus induce male differentiation by decreasing estrogen levels [7] while increasing androgen levels in a wide variety of fish species [8, 9]. For example, transient treatment of AIs during sex differentiation causes sex reversal of the tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) [10] and Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) [11], manifested by the development of genotypic females into phenotypically normal males. Therefore, early sex differentiation genes can be identified through a comparison of juvenile zebrafish samples from their changes under directed sex differentiation. However, we cannot determine which individuals have undergone sex reversal.The sex plasticity of adult zebrafish permits the possibility to distinguish early sex differentiation genes through comparison between individuals. In recent years, three independent studies have shown that adult zebrafish also retain sex plasticity. One study found that, with the disappearance of the oocyte and the retainment of glandular stem cells, the adult female zebrafish could be converted to a sperm-producing male [12]. Another study found that the transplantation of female germline cells into infertile adult males would lead to the conversion of an infertile adult male zebrafish into a fertile male [13]. The third study found that adult zebrafish underwent ovarian retraction and showed testicle-like organs after a 5-month AI treatment, followed by the production of normal sperms after another 8 weeks without AI treatment. Ovarian degeneration at 4-week treatment was the first morphological change during the sex reversal of adult zebrafish [14]. These studies indicate that the sex of adult female zebrafish can be reversed to males, while the molecular mechanisms in the reversal process have not been systematically studied.Here, in order to identify the molecular mechanisms involved in sex reversal, we performed RNA-Seq for adult zebrafish treated and untreated with AI Exemestane (EM) [15] for 32 days, when the first morphological change ovarian degeneration was induced by AI Fadrozole [14] (Fig. 1a). As a comparison, we also treated and untreated zebrafish with EM since their fertilization, and performed RNA-Seq of the juveniles at 32-day post-fertilization (dpf), when the sex differentiation was finished [16]. The genes with changed expression in EM-treated adult females and juveniles could represent the key genes in early sex differentiation and facilitate further research on sex determination in zebrafish.Experimental design. A general schematic overview of the zebrafish gonad RNA-Seq experiment. RNA was isolated from gonads dissected from 2 females and 2 males per group and subjected to RNA-Seq analysisThe effectiveness of EM was pre-tested through measuring vtg1 expression levels of the samples after EM treatment by qRT-PCR [17]. Vtg1 was produced in the liver and was transported into the ovary for oocyte development [18], which could reflect the Estradiol (E2) level in zebrafish [19]. We detected a 2–29 fold and 343–962 fold decrease of vtg1 expression level in the EM-females with short-term (7 days, Additional file 1) and long-term (32 days, Additional file 2) treatment, and thus confirmed the effectiveness of EM used in the study [17].To confirm that our EM treatment can also induce male-to-female sex reversal, we exposed adult females to EM (100 μg/L) and solvent control DMSO for 90 days, according to the time for sexual maturity in larval zebrafish, and checked their change by dissection. We found that the gonads of adult female zebrafish was testis instead of ovary (Additional file 3), indicating the female-to-male sex reversal induced by our EM treatment.We then exposed female and male adult zebrafish to low concentration (50 μg/L), intermediate concentration (100 μg/L), high concentration (200 μg/L) EM, solvent control DMSO and null control without EM or DMSO for 32 days to induce female-to-male sex reversal (Fig. 1). Neither decreased body weight nor width-to-length ratio of EM-females was observed (Additional file 4). Also, no obvious changes in gonads were found by dissection between females treated and untreated with EM for 32 days. We further observed the gonads in paraffin section, and found the deep staining caused by chromatin condensation in follicles of EM-females (Fig. 2a-e), demonstrating atretic follicles. Although atretic follicles might be related to apoptosis, TUNEL staining showed no evidence of apoptosis in EM-females (Fig. 2f-j). These observations above were inconsistent with the ovarian degeneration of adult females after four-week treatment of another AI Fadrozole [14], implying the differences in drug efficiency (EM vs Fadrozole) and/or treatment approaches (soaking vs feeding).Histologic staining of gonads used in our study. a-e.

The arrow pointing is the position of the chromatin condensation in follicles of EM-females in C-ETo identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the early transition from female to male, we dissected the gonads from two females and two males exposed to the low, intermediate, high concentrations of EM, solvent control or null control, and performed RNA-Seq. As a comparison with early transition of juveniles, we also included pools of whole body juvenile samples treated with and without EM for 32 days after fertilization. A total of 20 adult samples and 6 juvenile samples were sequenced with the mapping efficiency ranging from 78.21 to 92.67% (Additional file 5). The correlation coefficients between replicates were 0.76–0.99, showing satisfactory repeatability (Fig. 3).The correlation and hierarchical clustering of all the samples used in our study. Expression level was measured by read counts which were normalized by DESeq2.

The juvenile group clustered closer to the adult male group rather than the adult female group. In each group, samples treated with EM were clustered together with solvent control instead of null control, demonstrating small perturbations caused by DMSO (Fig. 3). The high correlation of gene expression between EM treated zebrafish and their solvent control in each group demonstrating little side effects induced by the 32-day EM treatment, allowing us to further detect the early transcriptional changes in the sex reversal. An extended treatment time might produce more detectable expression differences.To identify the key genes responsible for the early sex transition from female to male in adults, we first explored the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between solvent control females and solvent control males (DEGscF-scM) as a reference. We found a total of 3927 solvent-control-female-biased genes and 6797 solvent-control-male-biased genes (Additional file 6A, Additional files 7, 13). The larger number of solvent-control-male-biased genes than solvent-control-female-biased genes was consistent with the sex-biased gene expression patterns among most species. We validated the sex bias of some known female-biased genes, including vtg1 and gdf9 [17, 20] and male-biased genes, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase spermatogenic (gapdhs) [21] and anti-mullerian hormone (amh) [20]. As expected, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis also revealed that female-biased genes were enriched in female-specific functions like binding of sperm to zona pellucida, sperm-egg recognition, egg coat formation, and regulation of acrosome reaction, while male-biased genes were enriched in male-specific functions like cilium organization, movement and assembly (Additional file 6 BC).As another reference, we explored the DEGs between EM-males and solvent control males (DEGscM-emM). A total of 141 DEGscM-emM were found, including 100 up-regulated genes and 41 down-regulated genes in EM-male (Additional file 6 D, Additional files 8, 13). The GO analysis showed the up-regulated genes in EM-males were enriched in the GO terms related to ruffle assembly and organization (Additional file 6E), which were reported to be involved in fatty acid metabolism [22]. This suggested the abnormality of metabolic pathways in EM-males relative to control males, probably due to the changes in their metabolic functions to accelerate drug metabolism in response to the drug treatment.We next explored the DEGs between EM-females and solvent control females (DEGemF-scF). The effects of EM concentration were tested through comparisons among EM-females treated with low, intermediate, and high concentrations of EM. Only 134, 122 and 131 DEGs were found in the low-intermediate, low-high, and intermediate-high concentration comparisons. We thus compared all the six EM-females of different concentrations together with solvent control females, and found 548 DEGemF-scF, including 370 up-regulated genes and 178 down-regulated genes in EM-females (Fig. 4a, Additional files 9, 13). As a reference, we also explored the DEGs between solvent control females and null control females (DEGscF-ncF) and found 7512 DEGscF-ncF, including 3575 up-regulated genes and 3937 down-regulated genes in solvent control females (Additional files 10, 13). Vtg genes, including vtg6, vtg2, vtg4, and vtg7, were down-regulated in EM-females relative to both solvent control females and null control females, supporting lower endogenous E2 level caused by EM treatment.The gene expression profile in EM treated and solvent control adult female zebrafish group and juvenile zebrafish group. a. Comparison of differentially expressed gene in control female and EM-treated female gonad. Volcano plot shows genes control female ovary biased expression and EM-treated female ovary biased expression. b. EM-treated female-biased gene GO (Gene Ontology) enrichment analysis. The length of the bar corresponds to the number of genes enriched in the corresponding GO terms, and the color from red to blue represents the p.ajust value changes. c. GSEA (Gene set enrichment analysis) based on genes expressed in EM-treated female. The length of the bar corresponds to the number of genes enriched in the corresponding GO terms, and the color from dark blue to light blue represents the p.ajust value changes. d.

GO enrichment analysis based on genes which show control juvenile biased expression. f. GO enrichment analysis based on genes which show EM-treated juvenile biased expressionThe function of DEGemF-scF was further investigated through GO analysis and GSEA. Surprisingly, the DEGemF-scF up-regulated in EM-females were enriched in the GO terms mainly related to ovarian functions, like estrogen metabolic process, female gamete generation and oogenesis (Fig. 4b). Meanwhile, the DEGscM-emM up-regulated in EM-males were enriched in none of these terms, suggesting at least partial anti-masculinization induced by EM treatment in females to maintain the endogenous E2 level through activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad [23]. The GSEA result showed that genes upregulated in EM-females were enriched in 17 KEGG pathways, which are mainly involved in signal transduction and metabolic pathways (Fig. 4c, Additional file 11). Most of the up-regulated pathways have been reported to be driven by gonadal steroid, especially for the androgen in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) [24].To confirm the anti-masculinization in EM-females, we examined the alternative splicing of vasa, a molecular sex marker with sex-specific isoforms. The vasa is a conserved gene involved in spermatogenesis and germ cell formation in mice and flies, and is essential for sex differentiation and gamete formation in zebrafish. It has two isoforms in females, while only the shorter isoform lacks exon 4 in males. The isoform of vasa with the exon 4 was transcribed in future female zebrafish at 20–25 dpf, leading to apoptosis in future male zebrafish [16, 25]. Alternative splicing of vasa using rmats [26] showed an increased ratio of longer isoform in EM-females (Fig. 5a), supporting the anti-masculinization in EM-females.The different isoforms of gene vasa in samples we used. a. The different isoforms of gene vasa in adult EM-treated and solvent control zebrafish. b. The different isoforms of gene vasa in juvenile EM-treated and solvent control zebrafishTo compare the transcriptomic changes between juveniles and adult females after 32-day EM treatment, we explored the DEGs between EM-juveniles and control juveniles (DEGscJ-emJ) and found 263 DEGscJ-emJ (Fig. 4d, Additional files 12, 13). DEGscJ-emJ up-regulated in control juveniles were enriched in the biological processes related to positive regulation of reproductive process, sperm-egg recognition, and oocyte differentiation (Fig. 4e). These observations suggested that EM induced the sex differentiation of juveniles to male. Furthermore, GO analysis showed that the DEGscJ-emJ up-regulated in EM-juveniles were enriched in the biological processes related to cell death and apoptosis [27], implying that the progress of EM-induced sex differentiation to male was faster in juveniles than in adult females (Fig. 4f).We further checked the alternative splicing of vasa between EM-juveniles and control juveniles, and found, in contrast to adult EM-females with a decreased ratio of shorter isoform, EM-juveniles only expressed the shorter isoform of vasa, demonstrating the lack of feminization in EM-juveniles with the same treatment duration (Fig. 5b).We explored the molecular mechanisms underlying the early sex differentiation in zebrafish by exploring transcriptomic changes in the early stage of sex reversal in adults and juveniles after 32-day EM treatment. In this discussion, we focused on the rationality of our strategy. We also discussed the differences in sex plasticity between adults and juveniles as notes for reference in using sex reversal models.Fish sex is highly plastic. The germline stem cells exist both in juveniles and adults [12,13,14]. The down-regulation of endogenous estrogen induces female trans-differentiation in juvenile and adult fish [17, 28]. Impairing androgen synthesis and elevating exogenous estrogen can induce the male trans-differentiation in adult tilapia while exogenous estrogen alone can direct sex differentiation to female in juvenile fish [29]. These observations indicate the effects of sex hormone in the sex differentiation and maintenance in fish [30].The germline stem cells in juvenile adult female zebrafish could differentiate into male after AI treatment by regulating sex hormone levels [14], we could thus identify DEGs between juveniles or adult females treated and untreated with AI EM to explore the mechanisms underlying early sex differentiation. Comparing with juvenile model, the adult sex reversal model has unique advantages in the feasibility of sex identification and gonad manipulation.Sex differentiation of juvenile zebrafish, both future females and future males, is first involved in the development of an ovary (called “juvenile ovary”) [31]. Oocyte loss and ovary lumen breakdown by apoptosis at 21–25 dpf are male-specific events with testicular differentiation [31]. In females, early diplotene oocytes apoptosis was found in the juvenile ovary at 15–19 dpf, indicating a programmed loss of oocytes during ovarian development to eliminate unnecessary oocytes from the ovary [16]. In male zebrafish, all oocytes disappeared from gonads within 30 dpf and spermatocytes developed with the differentiation of testis, while female oocytes in the ovaries become mature [16, 31].Sex hormone treatment can induce directed sex differentiation and sexual reversal of the differentiated genital organs in zebrafish [14]. In the AI-induced directed sex differentiation in juvenile zebrafish, apoptotic oocytes of early diplotene and perinucleolar stages could be observed even at 15–40 dpf [27], longer than that in untreated juveniles. Besides, individuals display phenotypically male gonads at 71 dpf [28]. However, in the AI-induced female-to-male sex reversal, the ovary structure develops into testis and produces mature sperm after 5 months treatment in adult females [14], indicating poorer sex plasticity in adults than in juveniles.In this study, we found the up-regulation of genes related to apoptosis in juveniles after 32-day EM treatment, consistent with the effects of EM on sex differentiation [27], suggesting that EM may postpone ovarian apoptosis in juvenile zebrafish. Meanwhile, no evidence of ovarian apoptosis were observed between EM-females and control females over 32 days post spawning, suggesting slower sex differentiation and lower sex plasticity in adults than juveniles with EM treatment. Furthermore, the anti-masculinization in transcriptomes we observed in EM-females, relative to control females, supporting again the lower plasticity in adults than juveniles and providing the underlying mechanisms.Adult female zebrafish exhibit lower sex plasticity than juveniles due to anti-masculinization in adult zebrafish. This study provides new insights into the sex differentiation in zebrafish.The zebrafish used in this study were purchased from China Zebrafish Resource Center. All animal husbandry and procedures were approved by National Research Council (NRC) and performed strictly according to the guidelines set for the usage of animals by this committee.Zebrafish (AB strain) were obtained from China Zebrafish Resource Center and maintained at 28.5 °C with a light/dark cycle of 14/10 h.For each juvenile sample, fifty embryos of zebrafish were maintained in a petri dish from 0 dpf, and transferred to a three-litter tank in the recirculation systems at 5 dpf. They were fed with paramecium at 5–15 dpf and fairy shrimp at 16–32 dpf twice a day.For adult samples, three pairs of adult zebrafish were kept in a three-liter tank in the recirculation systems and fed twice a day with fish food (Zeigler AP100). Male and female adult zebrafish were distinguished according to their morphology, i.e., the females are fatter with a lighter color while the males are slender with a yellowish color. The sex of the adult zebrafish was further confirmed through their mating behavior at 90 dpf. The two sexes of adult zebrafish were separated on a transparent acrylic plate with evenly distributed holes to ensure the same treatment for all the fish samples in the same tank.In this study, 30 adult zebrafish and 150 juvenile zebrafish were used, including 10 adult zebrafish for histological examination, 20 adult zebrafish for transcriptome sequencing, and 150 juvenile zebrafish were divided into 6 samples for transcriptome sequencing.The AI EM (6-methylenandrosta-1, 4-diene-3, 17-dione, ≥ 98% purity, Bervita) used for adult and juvenile zebrafish was dissolved in 100 μg/L and 10 μg/L DMSO, respectively. Five groups of adult zebrafish were raised in continuous exposure to different concentrations of EM (50 μg/L, 100 μg/L and 200 μg/L), the solvent control (DMSO) or null control. Meanwhile, two groups of juvenile zebrafish were also raised in continuous exposure to 10 μg/L EM or the solvent control. We chose the EM concentration 10 μg/L for larval zebrafish because such concentration of another AI Fadrozole could direct sex differentiation to male and higher concentration of Fadrozole would reduce the survival rate of larval zebrafish [32] . Each adult group included a tank of zebrafish (three pairs of adult zebrafish) while each juvenile group included three tanks of zebrafish (each tank was raised from 50 embryos in a petri dish). All the groups were exposed for 32 days. The water in the tanks was refreshed every day with an equivalent concentration of EM or DMSO to ensure the effectiveness of drugs. The fish were anesthetized by immersion in 40 mg/L of tricaine methane sulfonate (MS-222, Sigma-Aldrich) to collect the gonad and were euthanized by immersion into a 0.5 g/L tricaine solution at the end of the experiment.We tested the effectiveness of EM with vtg1 expression after short-term EM treatment. In the short-term treatment, EM was dissolved in 100 μg/L DMSO. Four groups of adult female zebrafish were exposed for 7 days to EM with the concentration 0 μg/L, 50 μg/L, 200 μg/L and 800 μg/L, separately. Each group contained three replicates, with one zebrafish per replicate. The water was refreshed every day with an equivalent concentration of EM to ensure the effectiveness of EM.Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) of vtg1 was conducted on the whole body of 12 adult female zebrafish treated with the four concentrations of EM for 7 days. Total RNA were extracted from the somatic tissues by Trizol (Invitrogen) and incubated with RNase-free DNase I (Takara) at 37 °C to remove the genomic DNA. The reaction was terminated by adding 50 mM EDTA at 65 °C for 10 min. After determining the concentration of RNA by spectrophotometry (Thermo), 1000 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA with Revert Aid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo). The resulting cDNA was used as the template in the PCR system, and vtg1 expression was tested using the primers vtg1-F (5′-ACGAACAGCGAGAAAGAGATTG-3′) and vtg1-R (5′-GATGGGAACAGCGACAGGA-3′) [33]. 18 s was amplified as an internal control using forward (5′- CGGAGGTTCGAAGACGATCA-3′) and reverse primers (5′- TCGCTAGTTGGCATCGTTTATG-3′) [12]. The relative gene expression levels were determined based on the reference gene 18 s using the comparative method (ΔΔCt).The expression levels of vtg1 in somatic tissues of 16 samples treated with different concentrations of EM for 32 days were also checked by qRT-PCR with the same protocol. However, the internal control gene was changed to β-actin using the forward primer (5′-ATGGATGAGGAAATCGCTGCC) and reverse primer (3′-CTCCCTGATGTCTGGGTCGTC) [33].The zebrafish gonads of one female and one male per adult group were dissected for histological examination. All the female samples were fixed by immersing the samples in 10% buffered formalin in PBS for 24 h. The tissues were paraffin-embedded, processed for light microscopy and sectioned at 4 μm in thickness. The sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin for histopathological examination. The apoptosis in the ovary was examined by the TUNEL assay using TdT in situ apoptosis detection DeadEnd™ Colorimetric TUNEL System (G7360) from Promega according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer [34].The zebrafish gonads of two females and two males per adult group were dissected for RNA-Seq of the adults (Fig. 1). RNA samples from each individual were exacted using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Stranded PolyA+ RNA libraries were prepared at BGI with in-house kits. The library quality was assessed by checking the distribution of the fragment size using Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent) and the quantity of the libraries was measured using qRT-PCR (TaqMan Probe). A total of 16 qualified strand-specific cDNA libraries were constructed and were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq XTen System (Illumina). High-throughput sequencing raw image data files were converted to reads using CASAVA Base Calling (bcf2fastq) analysis.The whole bodies of 25 zebrafish from a tank per sample and three samples per treatment were used for RNA-Seq of the juveniles. All the six RNA samples were extracted and sequenced as adult zebrafish except that the sequencing libraries were prepared at Annoroud using VAHTS Stranded mRNA-seq Library Prep Kit (Vazyme Biotech) following the official protocol.The quality of all the raw reads was evaluated using FastqC (0.11.8) and sequencing report tool of MultiQC (0.9) [35]. Reads were mapped to the corresponding reference genome (Ensembl v95) using Hisat2 (2.0.5) with parameters “--dta -x --rna-strandness RF” and “--known-splicesite-infile”, followed by gene annotation in GTF format (Ensembl v95) [36]. The Hisat2 data were converted to BAM format and sorted by Samtools (1.5), and PCR duplicates were removed using Samtools command rmdup –S [37]. HTSeq (0.9.1) was used for counting reads with parameters “-t exon –i gene_id -r pos -s reverse” [38].DEGs in the zebrafish gonads were identified across eight different groups (two sexes and four treatments per sex for adults) using DESeq2 (1.22.1) [39]. Genes with adjusted p-value < 0.05 were considered as differentially expressed [40]. The same protocol was used for juvenile zebrafish to identify DEGs between two groups with and without EM treatment [41].Biological functions and metabolic processes among all the DEGs were identified using the tools org. Dr.eg.db (3.7.0) [42], clusterprofiler (3.10.1) [43] and Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (3.0) [44, 45].The differentially alternative spliced genes in zebrafish gonads were identified and visualized by rMATs (4.0.2) with paramenters “-t paired –readLength 150 –libType fr-firststrand” [26] and rmats2sashimiplot [46], respectively.Data from all 20 adult samples and 6 juvenile samples are available at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession (GSE142355).Differentially expressed genesDifferentially expressed genes between solvent control females and null control femalesDifferentially expressed genes between solvent control females and solvent control malesDifferentially expressed genes between EM-males and solvent control malesExemestanehematoxylin-eosinDifferentially expression genes between EM-females and solvent control females.Differentially expression genes between EM-juveniles and solvent control juvenilesGene set enrichment analysisGene ontologyWilson CA, High SK, McCluskey BM, Amores A, Yan YL, Titus TA, Anderson JL, Batzel P, Carvan MJ 3rd, Schartl M, et al.

Part of Springer Nature.Mummichog maintain egg production during EE2 exposure.Differences in EE2 uptake may be due to gill morphology.EE2 is primarily deposited in liver/gallbladder in mummichog, more so than other fish.High levels of E2 are maintained during ovarian maturation even as 17,20β-P levels rise.Low levels of EE2 feminize developing mummichog.The environmental estrogen 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) will depress or completely inhibit egg production in many common model teleosts at low concentrations (≤0.5 ng/L; Runnalls et al., 2015). This inhibition is not seen in the estuarine killifish, or mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), even when exposed to 100 ng/L EE2. This relative insensitivity to EE2 exposure indicates species-specific mechanisms for compensating for exogenous estrogenic exposure. This review compares various reproductive responses elicited by EE2 in mummichog to other common model teleosts, such as zebrafish (Danio rerio) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), identifying key endpoints where mummichog differ from other studied fish. For example, EE2 accumulates primarily in the liver/gall bladder of mummichog, which is different than zebrafish and fathead minnow in which accumulation is predominantly in the carcass. Despite causing species-specific differences in fecundity, EE2 has been shown to consistently induce hepatic vitellogenin in males and cause feminization/sex reversal during gonadal differentiation in larval mummichog, similar to other species. In addition, while gonadal steroidogenesis and plasma steroid levels respond to exogenous EE2, it is generally at higher concentrations than observed in other species. In mummichog, production of 17β-estradiol (E2) by full grown ovarian follicles remains high; unlike other teleost models where E2 synthesis decreases as 17α,20β-dihydroxy-4-prenen-3-on levels increase to induce oocyte maturation. New evidence in mummichog indicates some dissimilarity in gonadal steroidogenic gene expression responses compared to gene expression responses in zebrafish and fathead minnow exposed to EE2. The role of ovarian physiology continues to warrant investigation regarding the tolerance of mummichog to exogenous EE2 exposure. Here we present a comprehensive review, highlighting key biological differences in response to EE2 exposure between mummichog and other commonly used model teleosts.OPEN ACCESSPEER-REVIEWEDRESEARCH ARTICLEFanconi Anemia (FA) is a genomic instability syndrome resulting in aplastic anemia, developmental abnormalities, and predisposition to hematological and other solid organ malignancies. Mutations in genes that encode proteins of the FA pathway fail to orchestrate the repair of DNA damage caused by DNA interstrand crosslinks. Zebrafish harbor homologs for nearly all known FA genes. We used multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis to generate loss-of-function mutants for 17 FA genes: fanca, fancb, fancc, fancd1/brca2, fancd2, fance, fancf, fancg, fanci, fancj/brip1, fancl, fancm, fancn/palb2, fanco/rad51c, fancp/slx4, fancq/ercc4, fanct/ube2t, and two genes encoding FA-associated proteins: faap100 and faap24. We selected two indel mutations predicted to cause premature truncations for all but two of the genes, and a total of 36 mutant lines were generated for 19 genes. Generating two independent mutant lines for each gene was important to validate their phenotypic consequences. RT-PCR from homozygous mutant fish confirmed the presence of transcripts with indels in all genes. Interestingly, 4 of the indel mutations led to aberrant splicing, which may produce a different protein than predicted from the genomic sequence. Analysis of RNA is thus critical in proper evaluation of the consequences of the mutations introduced in zebrafish genome. We used fluorescent reporter assay, and western blots to confirm loss-of-function for several mutants. Additionally, we developed a DEB treatment assay by evaluating morphological changes in embryos and confirmed that homozygous mutants from all the FA genes that could be tested (11/17), displayed hypersensitivity and thus were indeed null alleles. Our multiplexing strategy helped us to evaluate 11 multiple gene knockout combinations without additional breeding. Homozygous zebrafish for all 19 single and 11 multi-gene knockouts were adult viable, indicating FA genes in zebrafish are generally not essential for early development. None of the mutant fish displayed gross developmental abnormalities except for fancp-/- fish, which were significantly smaller in length than their wildtype clutch mates. Complete female-to-male sex reversal was observed in knockouts for 12/17 FA genes, while partial sex reversal was seen for the other five gene knockouts. All adult females were fertile, and among the adult males, all were fertile except for the fancd1 mutants and one of the fancj mutants. We report here generation and characterization of zebrafish knockout mutants for 17 FA disease-causing genes, providing an integral resource for understanding the pathophysiology associated with the disrupted FA pathway.Deficiencies in repair of DNA damage can cause diseases such as Fanconi anemia (FA), which is characterized by birth defects, bone marrow failure, anemia, leukemia and other cancers. A set of proteins constitute the FA pathway and together orchestrate the DNA repair process. Inactivation of one or more gene(s) encoding the proteins of the DNA repair pathway in an animal model would enable us to study the functions of these proteins in maintenance of normal cellular functions and the overall health of an individual in the absence of function. We systematically targeted the FA pathway in zebrafish using CRISPR/Cas9. We generated 36 fish lines with loss-of-function mutations in 19 FA pathway genes and showed that all survive to adulthood. We did not notice obvious morphological changes except in fancp gene-inactivated fish, which were smaller in length. However, all mutant fish were either exclusively or in majority male. Unlike reduced fertility among FA patients, all adult mutant fish were fertile, except for the fancd1 and fancj knockout males. These mutant zebrafish will serve as a huge resource for the scientific community to study the role of FA proteins in fish development, DNA repair, and as models for FA disease.Citation: Ramanagoudr-Bhojappa R, Carrington B, Ramaswami M, Bishop K, Robbins GM, Jones M, et al.

About 2/3 of patients display congenital abnormalities affecting multiple organ systems including the skin, kidney and urinary tract, ears, eyes, gastrointestinal, heart, and central nervous systems. Short stature, microcephaly, microphthalmia, hypogenitalia, supernumerary or hypoplastic/absent thumb with or without absence of radius, are often observed in FA patients [3]. BMF is an inevitable consequence of FA resulting in aplastic anemia due to the depletion of hematopoietic stem cells. The age of onset of anemia is variable but typically is in the first decade [4]. Patients also develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome that ultimately progresses to AML [4]. An increased predisposition to solid tumors, particularly head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), esophageal and gynecological tissues is associated with FA [1, 5]. The incidence of HNSCC in FA patients is increased 700-fold, and the onset is much earlier (in a patient’s 30s) compared to sporadic HNSCC [6]. In about 25% of patients, the first clinical presentation is AML or solid tumors [7, 8]. Thus, FA is phenotypically a heterogeneous disease [9].Increased chromosomal instability from impaired DNA crosslinking repair upon exposure to DNA crosslinking agents such as Diepoxybutane (DEB) or Mitomycin C (MMC), is a universal cellular phenotype of patient cells and serves as an unambiguous diagnostic test for FA [3]. In humans, mutations in 22 genes are known to cause FA: FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCI, FANCJ/BRIP1, FANCL, FANCM, FANCN/PALB2, FANCO/RAD51C, FANCP/SLX4, FANCQ/ERCC4/XPF, FANCR/RAD51, FANCS/BRCA1, FANCT/UBE2T, FANCU/XRCC2, FANCV/MAD2L2/REV7, and FANCW/RFWD3. Our understanding of the disease is continually evolving as three of these genes were reported within the last two years [10–12]. These genes encode proteins that participate in the FA pathway (also known as FA/BRCA pathway), which orchestrates the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICL) [5, 12]. Proper function of FA proteins has been shown to be important in maintaining hematopoietic stem cells, guarding genomic integrity, and preventing tumorigenesis [6, 13]. Additional roles for FA proteins are emerging in aging [14], telomere biology [15], and selective autophagy and inflammation [16]. Animal models to help understand the molecular basis of FA clinical presentations and help explore the role of FA proteins in critical biological functions are needed.Biochemical and genetic studies have revealed to some extent the structural and functional components of the FA pathway [6, 12, 17–23]. In general, there are four protein complexes each performing a distinct function in accomplishing the repair of the damaged DNA: core complex (FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL, and FANCM), ID2 complex (FANCD2-FANCI), nucleolytic processing (FANCP and FANCQ), and homologous recombination (FANCD1, FANCJ, FANCN, FANCO, FANCR, FANCS, FANCU, and FANCW). Upon recognition of a signal of DNA damage the core complex along with FANCT and the FA-associated proteins (FAAP) ubiquitinates the ID2 complex. Subsequent nucleolytic processing leads to translesion synthesis by a DNA polymerase (FANCV), and the repair process is completed by homologous recombination. Though distinct biochemical functions of most of the core complex proteins that perform ubiquitination is yet unknown, it appears that sub-complexes of FANCA-FANCG confer stability to the complex, FANCC-FANCE-FANCF offer specificity and efficiency, and FANCB-FAAP100-FANCL along with FANCT transfer ubiquitin moieties on to the ID2 complex.Only a fraction of FA gene homologs are present in any invertebrate model organism [24, 25], limiting the utility of these models. All are present in zebrafish with the exception of FANCS/BRCA1 [26, 27]. Zebrafish provide an excellent opportunity to understand FA associated BMF and congenital anomalies, as hematopoiesis and embryonic development in zebrafish are well studied [28] and the ability to perform high throughput mutagenesis by CRISPR/Cas9 in zebrafish [29, 30] allows us to generate targeted mutations readily in many genes. We generated loss-of-function (frameshift) mutants for these 17 FA genes: fanca, fancb, fancc, fancd1/brca2, fancd2, fance, fancf, fancg, fanci, fancj/brip1, fancl, fancm, fancn/palb2, fanco/rad51c, fancp/slx4, fancq/ercc4, fanct/ube2t. We also targeted two additional genes encoding FA-associated proteins (faap100 and faap24). Here, we present our data on the generation of mutant fish, evaluation of the consequences of genomic indels at the mRNA level, and characterization of mutant fish phenotypes such as growth, viability, sex differentiation, and fertility.The goal of our study was to analyze the in vivo functions of all known FA genes. Therefore, we applied the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate loss-of-function mutations in zebrafish. We targeted 17 genes known to have disease-causing mutations in FA patients, and two genes encoding for FA-associated proteins (S1 Table). To maximize the chances of generating loss-of-function mutations, we selected CRISPR target sites in the first half of the coding region (S1 Fig). Based on recent studies that demonstrated efficient multiplexed mutagenesis in zebrafish using CRISPR/Cas9 [29, 30], we employed this approach to generate knockouts. Multiplexing was primarily based on the known interactions among the FA proteins and their specific roles in the FA pathway [18–21], and therefore we also generated multi-gene knockouts to study their combined effect (Table 1). Seven groups of pooled sgRNAs, that were prescreened for activity, were injected to target these 19 genes, which included three groups each of two and three genes and a group of four genes. The injected fish (mosaic founders) were screened for germline transmitting mutations in each of the co-injected genes by genotyping of embryos from their outbred progeny. By screening a total of 75 founder fish, we identified 59 germline transmitting founders that passed multiple combinations of indel mutations in the co-injected genes. About three quarters of the germline transmitting founders showed mutations in two or more genes (46/59 = 78%) (Table 1). Our data demonstrate that multiplexing of sgRNAs is an efficient approach to directly generate multi-gene mutant fish lines when using prescreened active sgRNA’s.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007821.t001We outbred the selected founder fish with germline transmitting mutations to generate F1 fish heterozygous for frameshift mutations in each targeted gene. These fish were genotyped at adulthood for each of the co-targeted genes. Our selection criteria for establishing mutant lines was to use either the F1 fish heterozygous for the desired mutant alleles in multiple genes or the F1 fish heterozygous for specific mutant alleles while carrying WT alleles at all other co-injected loci. We excluded any fish that were heterozygous for the desired allele but carried a non-desirable mutant allele, such as an in-frame indel mutation at the other co-injected loci, to avoid extensive genotyping in future generations. We selected two frameshift mutations for each gene, except one each for fancb and fancd1, resulting in a total of 36 single gene mutant alleles for the follow-up phenotypic analyses (S2 Fig, S2 Table). Through our multiplexing effort, we were able to generate nine multi-gene mutant allele combinations across all seven injection groups (S3 Table). Details of the selected mutant alleles including the size of indel, predicted cDNA and protein changes, and their designation by The Zebrafish Information Network (https://zfin.org/action/feature/line-designations) are provided in S2 Table. In the subsequent sections, we refer to the mutant alleles by their “hg” nomenclature as listed in S2 Table.An indel in the genomic sequence that is not a multiple of three is predicted to cause a frameshift in translation, therefore we confirmed the presence of each predicted mutation in the mRNA transcripts. This effort would also reveal aberrant splicing caused by indel variants, if any. To this end, we performed RT-PCR for all mutant alleles using RNA extracted from adult WT and homozygous mutant fish. Our RNA analysis showed the following: 1) All 36 mutant alleles yielded an RT-PCR product (S3A Fig). 2) Products of predicted size, one wild-type and one including the indel mutation, were observed in all but one mutant allele, hg58 (Figs 1A and S3A). 3) An additional product was observed in three mutant alleles: hg41, hg42, and hg45 (Fig 1B–1D). Details of splicing aberrations in these 4 cases are described below.(A-D) WT and mutant allele RT-PCR products resolved on 2% agarose gel are shown in the left panels and splicing aberrations are depicted in the right panels. (A) The observed RT-PCR product for fancl_hg58 mutant was smaller in size (red arrow) than expected based on the 25 bp insertion in exon 8. The sequence of the hg58 product showed shift in its splice acceptor site resulting in loss of 48 bp sequence, that includes 23 bp from exon 8 beginning and CRISPR/Cas9 induced 25 bp insert. (B-D) Partial activation of cryptic splice site near the indel mutation was observed in fanca_hg41, fancb_hg42 and fancd1_hg45 mutant alleles. The RT-PCR products for these mutants showed two bands, one matched expected size (yellow arrows) and the other was from an altered splice product (red arrows). PCR products were cloned and sequenced to determine aberrant splice product sequence. In hg41 mutant, the indel mutation (2 bp del) in exon 12 results in partial skipping of mutated exon (B). In hg42 mutant, the indel mutation (4 bp del) in exon 1 results in partial use of new splice donor site in intron 1 (C). In hg45 mutant, the indel mutation (5 bp ins) in exon 10 results in partial use of new splice acceptor and donor in exon 10 (D). (E) The consequence on the predicted encoded protein based on the genomic indel mutation, and the observed aberrant splice product for all four mutant lines are shown. RT-PCR gel image data for all 36 alleles is shown in S3A Fig.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007821.g001The RT-PCR product from the fanclhg58/hg58 mutant was smaller than the expected size, based on the CRISPR/Cas9-induced 25 bp insertion mutation in exon 8 (Fig 1A). Sequencing revealed that the 25 bp insertion created a cryptic splice acceptor site leading to the deletion of 23 bp in the mRNA, resulting in a different frameshift mutation than predicted, still likely to cause a loss-of-function (Figs 1E and S3B).The RT-PCR products from fancahg41/hg41, fancbhg42/hg42, and fancd1hg45/hg45 revealed a second band, in addition to the expected band, indicating partial activation of a cryptic splice site near the indel mutation (Fig 1B–1D). The intensity of the additional band in all three mutants was weaker, suggesting low abundance of the altered splice product. Nevertheless, it might be enough to have an effect on the phenotype by generating a low level of functional protein. To determine the effect of altered splicing on the reading frame and the encoded protein, we analyzed these RT-PCR products by cloning and sequencing. In the fancahg41/hg41 mutant, the additional product was missing exon 12, which contained the 2bp deletion mutation, due to altered splicing (Figs 1B and S3C). The altered splice product still generated a frameshift mutant protein (p.E378Afs*12) (Fig 1E). In the fancbhg42/hg42 mutant, the additional product had an insertion of 31 bp from intron 1 (Figs 1C and S3D), due to aberrant splicing caused by a cryptic splice donor in intron 1. The combined effect of a 4 bp deletion mutation near the end of exon 1 and the retention of 31 bp in the region adjacent to intron 1 generated an in-frame mutant protein with a deletion of 2 amino acids and an insertion of 11 unrelated amino acids (p.F278_Q279delinsRSVMLPQVFLR). The additional product in the fancd1hg45/hg45 mutant had a deletion of 92 bp in exon 10 (includes 87 bp from WT sequence and a 5 bp insertion mutation) (Figs 1D and S3E). The aberrant splice product generated an in-frame mutant protein with a deletion of 29 amino acids (p.G346_S374del). The in-frame mutant proteins generated by fancbhg42/hg42 and fancd1hg45/hg45 could potentially maintain their function (Fig 1E). The unintended consequences of CRISPR/Cas9-induced indel mutations such as aberrant splicing, that we observed in our zebrafish mutants, highlight the importance of analyzing the RNA, rather than relying on genomic DNA analysis alone. This is particularly important if the mutant fish do not display any phenotype.It is important to validate that the frameshift mutant alleles lead to generation of truncated proteins as predicted and are therefore true loss-of-function alleles. However, due to the absence of zebrafish antibodies or cross-species reacting antibodies for nearly all FA proteins, we could not evaluate protein expression in our mutants, except for Fancd2. Finding that a human FANCD2 antibody recognized its zebrafish counterpart, allowed us to confirm that the Fancd2 is not expressed in both fancd2 knockout lines, indicating that these are indeed null alleles (S4 Fig).As an alternate method, we used a recently described functional fluorescent mutation reporter assay [31] to test mutant alleles for a subset of genes: fance (hg48), fancf (hg50), fancg (hg52), fancl (hg59) and fanct (hg70). Despite robust control RFP expression, lack of GFP expression driven by the mutant allele, when compared to the WT allele, indicated that these frameshift mutations indeed introduce a premature stop codon (S5 Fig). These data show that the mutant alleles for all five genes tested are true loss-of-function frameshift mutations. In addition, as described below, we demonstrated hypersensitivity of nearly all frameshift mutant alleles to DEB treatment indicating that these are indeed null alleles.FA patient cells show hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents such as DEB and MMC resulting in chromosomal breakage [3]. To determine if our mutants also exhibit similar hypersensitivity, the embryos from inbred heterozygous mutants were treated with DEB. The homozygous knockouts from fancd1 (hg45), fancd2 (hg47), fanci (hg54), fancj (hg56 and hg57), fancn (hg62), fancp (hg66) and fanct (hg70) mutant lines showed severe morphological changes compared to their WT and heterozygote clutch mates, indicating their hypersensitivity to DEB (Fig 2A). However, similar hypersensitivity was not distinct for the remaining mutants, possibly due to the protection provided by wildtype maternal transcript. To test this, we set up fanca (hg41) homozygous mutant incross, as both male and female were available, and also outcross with wildtype counterparts. Untreated embryos from all three crosses looked normal. Hypersensitivity to DEB treatment was observed among all the embryos from incross, and most embryos from female mutant outcross despite all being heterozygotes. But, none of the embryos from male mutant outcross were affected indicating that the presence of wildtype fanca maternal transcript rescues embryos from hypersensitivity to DEB treatment (Fig 2B). Additionally, we incrossed homozygous knockout mutant fish for fancb (hg42), fanco (hg65) and fancq (hg69), and observed similar hypersensitivity of the embryos to DEB treatment (Fig 2C). The lack of null females due to sex reversal phenotypes (described later) prevented us from preforming inbreeding experiments for other alleles. Overall, we demonstrate homozygous mutant embryo specific DEB sensitivity for 11 out of 17 FA gene mutants either by heterozygote or homozygote inbreeding. Nevertheless, our DEB test results further validate all the tested knockout mutants indeed have lost function of the targeted gene.(A) Embryos obtained from inbreeding heterozygous knockouts of fancd1 (hg45; 0.9 μg/mL DEB), fancd2 (hg47; 0.9 μg/mL DEB), fanci (hg54; 0.65 μg/mL DEB), fancj (hg56 and hg57; 0.6 μg/mL DEB), fancn (hg62; 0.8 μg/mL DEB), fancp (hg66; 0.9 μg/mL DEB) and fanct (hg70; 0.8 μg/mL DEB) were treated at indicated DEB concentrations between 4–72 hpf. Treated embryos were classified based on severity of morphological changes observed into three phenotypic groups: normal (WT appearance), moderate (slight body curvature and minor edema) and severe (emaciated appearance, severe body curvature and large edema). An example image of DEB treated embryo (72 hpf) for each group is shown on the left. Distribution of each phenotypic group for a given genotype are displayed as stacked bar chart. The segments in bar show percent of embryos in each morphological group: normal (white), moderate (light blue), severe (dark blue). The number in each segment depicts the number of embryos for a given phenotypic group. (B) Maternal WT fanca transcript rescues embryos from DEB hypersensitivity. Embryos obtained from indicated fanca_hg41 breeding were treated with DEB (0.8 μg/mL). Representative images show untreated and DEB treated embryos. (C) Embryos generated from inbreeding of homozygous knockouts of fancb (hg42; 0.8 μg/mL DEB), fanco (hg65; 0.8 μg/mL DEB) and fancq (hg69; 0.5 μg/mL DEB) were treated at indicated DEB concentrations. Representative images show untreated and DEB treated embryos.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007821.g002To determine if the homozygous knockouts survive to adulthood, we grew progenies from pairwise heterozygous crosses of all mutations to adulthood and determined the genotypes of the surviving fish. Homozygous knockout fish were observed among the surviving adults for all genes, indicating no lethality at earlier developmental stages for the generated alleles. Furthermore, the survival was at the expected Mendelian ratios for the majority of the targeted genes. In fancp, fance, and faap24, however, we observed discordant results between the survival of homozygous fish for the two different mutant alleles, where survival of one of the two knockout alleles was consistent with a Mendelian ratio while in the other allele it was not (Figs 3, S6 and S7). Reduced survival was statistically significant for fancphg66/hg66 (p = 0.0003) but not for fancphg67/hg67 (p = 0.0875) fish. Genotyping at one month post fertilization (mpf) revealed that the number of fancphg66/hg66 homozygous fish at this age were consistent with Mendelian ratio (Fig 4A(i)), indicating that some of the fancphg66/hg66 fish die between 1 mpf and adulthood. Similarly, fancehg48/hg48 (p = 0.011) and faap24hg75/hg75 (p = 0.027) fish showed reduced survival, while fancehg49/hg49 fish (p = 0.077) and faap24hg74/hg74 (p = 0.079) survived in expected numbers (S7 Fig). Overall, our data suggest knockouts of individual genes from FA pathway in zebrafish are not lethal.Progeny from inbred heterozygous fish for each allele were genotyped at 3–6 mpf. Data are shown as stacked bar chart, where each bar represents one mutant allele, as marked on the X-axis by the gene name and hg#. Segments on the bar show % of fish in each of the three expected genotypes: +/+, +/-, and -/- as marked on the Y- axis. Numbers in each segment depict the number of fish for each genotype. Data from one allele for each gene are shown here and the other allele is shown in S6 Fig. Reduced adult survival was observed in fancehg48/hg48 and fancphg66/hg66 fish (Chi-square analysis, *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001, respectively).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007821.g003Standard length measurements of fancp fish at 1 mpf (A), and 4 mpf (B). (i) Number of fish genotyped and measured for both fancp alleles: hg66 and hg67. (ii) Representative images of fancp+/+ and fancphg66/hg66 fish with red arrows marking the beginning of caudal fin used in length measurements. (iii) Data on body size measurements for fancp+/+, fancphg66/+ and fancphg66/hg66 fish. Both time points show a significant decrease in size of fancphg66/hg66 fish compared to the WT and heterozygous clutch mates (ANOVA analysis, ***p<0.001). Data for fancp_hg67 is shown in S8 Fig.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007821.g004Multiplexing enabled us to obtain fish with mutations in multiple genes directly from founder fish outcrosses. Theoretically, twenty-six combinations of double, triple, and quadruple gene F1 heterozygous knockouts were possible from the seven injection groups (S3 Table). However, our selection criteria were to retain and analyze only those carrying the mutant alleles described for single gene knockouts (S2 Table). Nevertheless, we obtained nine combinations of multi-gene F1 heterozygous mutants. Six of these were inbred to generate multi-gene homozygous knockouts, while the remaining three were not inbred due to the absence of either male or female carriers. Our data showed that all 11 possible multi-gene homozygous knockout fish were adult viable, suggesting absence of epistasis in the knockouts for tested gene combinations (S3 Table).During the adult survival experiment, we observed that the fancp-/- adult fish for both mutations were smaller in size than their WT and heterozygous clutch mates. To follow up on this observation, inbreedings for fancphg66/+ and fancphg67/+ were done in duplicate and their progeny’s body length were measured at juvenile (1 mpf) and adult stages (4 mpf). The homozygous knockout fish with both alleles were significantly smaller in body length than their clutch mates at 1 and 4 mpf (Figs 4A and 4B, S8A and S8B). The observed smaller body length phenotype in fancp-/- appears to reflect the short stature frequently observed in FA patients.To examine the effect of fancq mutant alleles on smaller body length of fancp mutant alleles, we inbred double heterozygotes (fancphg66/+;fancqhg68/+) and measured body lengths of their progenies. All fancp homozygous knockout fish, irrespective of fancq genotype, were significantly smaller, indicating the fancq mutation has no role in expression of this phenotype (S9 Fig).Zebrafish have high developmental plasticity for sex determination and they lack the sex-determining chromosome(s) of mammals [32]. The plasticity of sex determination in zebrafish can help us to study mechanisms and factors that are associated with gonadogenesis and hypogonadism. We raised progeny from inbred heterozygous fish from one allele for each FA gene (alleles shown in Fig 3) and sexed them after genotyping at 3–4 mpf. Surprisingly, for 12 FA genes (fancc, fancd1, fancd2, fance, fancf, fancg, fanci, fancj, fancl, fancn, fancp, and fanct), no females were observed among surviving homozygous knockouts, and for the remaining five FA genes (fanca, fancb, fancm, fanco, and fancq), homozygous knockout females were in greatly reduced numbers (Fig 5). The presence of only males, or significantly increased number of males, in adult knockouts (Fig 5) and the absence of reduced survival of adult knockouts (except for fancphg66/hg66) (Figs 3 and S6) suggests a female-to-male sex reversal phenotype among FA gene knockout fish. We tested both alleles for fancp due to reduced body length, and allele specific discrepancy in their survival. The female-to-male sex reversal phenotype was observed in both fancp lines (Fig 5). We also tested both fancj alleles as they displayed a different male fertility phenotype (as described in the section below). Interestingly, the fancjhg56/hg56 showed a complete female-to-male sex reversal, whereas the fancjhg57/hg57 allele showed a partial sex reversal phenotype (Fig 5). It is possible that the partial sex reversal phenotypes observed for fanca, fancb, fancm, fanco, and fancq may also be allele specific. To test this, we checked other mutant allele lines for these genes except for fancb, for which we only had one mutant allele. Second mutant alleles for fanca, fanco and fancq also revealed the partial sex reversal phenotype, whereas no females were observed in the second fancm mutant line indicating complete sex reversal phenotype (S10 Fig). Overall, our data show that the FA genes are important for gonadogenesis in zebrafish, which may reflect the commonly observed hypogonadism among FA patients [2, 3].Progenies from inbred heterozygous fish for each gene were genotyped around 3 months of age and the sex was determined. For each gene, the data is shown as bar graph for number of male and female fish in each genotype category as marked on the X-axis. Numbers at the top of bar depict the number of fish. Significantly increased number of males were observed for fanca, fancb, fancm, fanco, and fancq homozygous knockouts, while only males were observed for the rest. For fancj-/-, no females were observed in fancjhg56/56, whereas greatly reduced number of females were observed in fancjhg57/hg57.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007821.g005To determine the stage at which FA gene mutations affects sex differentiation, we examined histological sections of larval (21 dpf) and juvenile (45 dpf) stage gonads of fancc_hg43 mutant fish as a representative mutant allele. At 21 dpf, the gonads of both homozygous knockout and heterozygous fish were undifferentiated and contained gonocytes. By 45 dpf, a definitive testicular differentiation was apparent among homozygotes, whereas both ovarian or testicular differentiation was apparent among heterozygotes (S11 Fig).To examine if loss of tp53 can rescue the sex reversal phenotypes as previously demonstrated for fancd1, fancl and fancr [33–36], we introduced tp53 knockout mutation into fancp mutant fish as a representative of FA gene mutants with complete female to male sex reversal. First, tp53 mutant (hg91: c.368_374delCCGTGGT; p.S123Ffs*38) fish were generated using CRISPR-Cas9 method to target exon 5. We deliberately targeted exon 5 to generate a frameshift indel mutant that should result in premature termination in all known tp53 transcript isoforms [37, 38]. RT-PCR and fluorescent mutation reporter assay confirmed that the frameshift caused by 7bp deletion results in premature termination (Fig 6A and 6B). Furthermore, the availability of zebrafish Tp53 antibody allowed us to confirm that our tp53 mutant allele is indeed a null mutant (Fig 6C). To test the effect of the tp53 null mutation on fancp sex reversal phenotype, we crossed fancphg67/+;tp53hg91/h91 mutant fish with fancphg67/+;tp53hg91/+ fish. The resulting progenies were grown to adulthood to determine the correlation between the sex and genotype of the fish. Both male and female fish were observed with fancphg67/hg67;tp53hg91/hg91 genotype (Fig 6D), indicating that Tp53-mediated apoptosis of germ cells causes the sex reversal in fancp homozygous knockouts and may be a common mechanism of sex reversal phenotype in FA knockout fish.(A) RT-PCR confirmed the absence of any aberrant splice variants around tp53 gene mutation. Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of CRISPR-Cas9 introduced 7bp deletion mutation. The products were resolved on 2% agarose gel. (B) Reporter assay to check the expression of tp53 frameshift mutant. Representative images at 1 dpf of embryos co-injected with the specified reporter mRNA and TagRFP are shown as RFP (left panel), GFP (middle panel) and merged (right panel). (C) Western blot analysis shows absence of Tp53 protein in the knockout embryo extracts. Twenty-four hpf embryos collected from tp53hg91/hg91 homozygous knockout fish incross were used to check the loss of expression of Tp53 protein. Embryos obtained from TAB5 incross were used as WT controls. Expression of β-actin was used as loading control. (D) Progenies from fancphg67/+;tp53hg91/+ and fancphg67/+;tp53hg91/hg91 breeding were genotyped around 4 mpf and the sex was determined. Number of male and female fish in each genotype category is presented. The genotypes are marked on the X-axis. Among the fancp homozygous knockouts, only males were observed with fancphg67/hg67;tp53hg91/+ genotype, whereas both males and females were observed with fancphg67/hg67;tp53hg91/hg91 genotype.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007821.g006A critical role played by FA proteins in zebrafish gonadogenesis led us to test whether FA proteins were also required for gametogenesis. Many FA patients experience impaired gametogenesis, defective meiosis and sterility [3, 39]. To this end, we outbred all available FA gene knockout males (all 17 genes) and females (5 genes) with WT fish and checked the embryo viability at 24 hours post fertilization (hpf) to evaluate the fertility of the mutant fish. Surprisingly, the embryos from all but fancd1hg45/hg45 and fancjhg56/hg56 male knockout outbreeding were found viable, indicating knockout male fish for 15 out of 17 FA genes were fertile (Fig 7A). It appears that, but for fancd1 and fancj, all other FA genes may not be necessary for spermatogenesis in zebrafish. Similarly, viable embryos were observed in all five FA gene knockout female outcrosses (fanca, fancb, fancm, fanco, and fancq) indicating these FA genes are not needed for oogenesis in zebrafish (Fig 7A).(A) Viability of embryos from outbred homozygous knockout fish at 24 hpf was determined to assess their fertility. Except fancd1 and fancj knockout males, all other knockouts (both males and females) had no fertility defect. For fancd1hg45/hg45 a small fraction of embryos (<5%) were found viable at 24 hpf. (B-C) Histology images (20x objective) of hematoxylin and eosin stained adult testis of fancd1hg45/hg45 (B) and fancjhg56/hg56 fish (C). The red arrows point to the area where mature spermatozoa reside in the testis. Empty intra-testicular ducts were observed in homozygous mutant testis (ii) but not in the heterozygous testis (i).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007821.g007In fancd1hg45/hg45 male outbreeding, only a small fraction of embryos (<5%) were found viable at 24 hpf, indicating a partial sterility phenotype in these fish. With respect to fancjhg56/hg56 male outbreeding, no viable embryos were observed among 25 clutches indicating its essential role in spermatogenesis. To understand the cellular basis for infertility in fancd1hg45/hg45 and fancjhg56/hg56 males, we analyzed their testes by histology. The homozygous knockouts lacked mature spermatozoa in testes, whereas the heterozygous males had normal testes with mature spermatozoa (Fig 7B and 7C).Presence of complete sterility in fancjhg56/hg56 knockout males prompted us to test the fertility of fancjhg57/hg57 males. Surprisingly, the embryos produced by fancjhg57/hg57 males were viable. The observed contrasting phenotypes between the two fancj mutations suggest that one of them may be hypomorphic. The fancjhg56/hg56 fish showed female-to-male sex reversal, the phenotype typical of most FA gene knockouts. The defective fertility phenotype in this line could reflect a critical role of fancj in meiotic homologous recombination. This is in contrast to the fancjhg57/hg57 fish that were both fertile and displayed partial sex reversal phenotype, suggesting a potential hypomorphic variant. At the molecular level both alleles are generated from the same sgRNA and are predicted to cause frameshift mutations with premature truncation of the protein, and both alleles display hypersensitivity to DEB treatment (Fig 2A). Thus, our data demonstrate how phenotypes for knockout lines generated from the same CRISPR/Cas9 target site of a gene can vary, emphasizing the importance of testing multiple mutant lines to identify the phenotypic consequences of a gene knockout.FA is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder with mutations in 22 genes known to cause the disease so far. Here, we report generation and characterization of zebrafish knockouts for all recessively inherited FA genes known at the start of this study, except for FANCS/BRCA1 as its zebrafish homolog has not been identified. Three new FA genes (FANCU, FANCV, FANCW) were identified after initiation of our study. A knockout zebrafish model for the only autosomal dominant FA gene (FANCR/RAD51) was also reported recently [36]. In addition to the 17 FA genes, our study targeted zebrafish homologs for two genes encoding FA-associated proteins (FAAP24 and FAAP100), which are components of the FA core complex that facilitates the ID2 ubiquitination step of the DNA repair pathway. We generated two loss-of-function alleles for nearly all targeted genes (17/19) enabling evaluation of resulting phenotypes in a reliable manner. In addition, we generated and confirmed viability of eleven combinations of double and triple knockouts, while founder lines to generate many other combinations for multiple gene knockouts are established. This study serves as an integral resource for exploring the FA pathway, and will aid future studies focused on understanding the disease process and the biological processes that become compromised in FA patients, including DNA repair, stem cell maintenance, differentiation of hematopoietic lineages, tumor suppression and aging, among others [1, 6, 14–16, 40].The ability to perform high throughput CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis in zebrafish by a) targeting multiple genes in groups [29, 30], b) utilizing the CRISPR-STAT method to screen for functional guide RNAs [41], and c) adopting a sensitive fluorescent PCR assay for genotyping [42], prompted us to undertake this large effort. We injected seven pools of sgRNA to generate mutant alleles in 19 FA pathway genes. Our data demonstrate that multiplexing of sgRNAs is an efficient approach to generate both individual and multi-gene mutant fish lines. Multiplexing, instead of independent injections, significantly reduced the fish husbandry costs and space needed to establish mutant lines.To date, zebrafish knockouts for three FA genes, fancd1, fancl and fancr/rad51 have been reported, however, none of these employed a targeted mutagenesis approach with one exception. Two independent fancd1 mutant lines were identified, one caused by retroviral insertion [34] and another by the ENU (N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea)-mediated chemical mutagenesis method [35], both residing in the large exon 11. A recent study reported a fancd1 mutant line generated by targeting of exon 8 by CRISPR-Cas9 [43]. A fancl mutant [33] was identified from an insertion-mutagenesis in a Tol2 transposon-mediated enhancer trap screen. Recently, a knockout for the autosomal dominant FA gene, fancr/rad51, was generated using the ENU-mediated method [36]. The emergence of highly efficient CRISPR/Cas9 technology made it possible for us to efficiently test 19 genes.Our RNA analysis revealed presence of an mRNA carrying the frameshift indel variant in all 36 mutant lines, which is expected to generate truncated proteins. Introducing indel variants in the genomic DNA to create mutant lines can sometime affect splicing by altering the conserved splicing signals such as exonic/intronic splicing enhancers/silencers [44] activating cryptic splice sites. We did observe aberrant splicing in 4/36 mutations, two of which would still result in truncated proteins, while the other two would generate an indel but maintain the reading frame (Fig 1). Often, close proximity of mutations to the natural splice site could affect canonical splicing. Indeed, one of these four (fancb_hg42) was located 2bp from the nearest natural splice donor site (S2 Table). Two recent reports also evaluated mRNA expression associated with CRISPR/Cas9-induced indel frameshift mutations in zebrafish and did observe a fraction of aberrantly spliced RNA. Specifically, a 7 bp insertion in pycr1a caused exon-skipping leading to 71 bp deletion at the cDNA level [31], and a 7 bp deletion in exon 3 of smyd1a resulted in utilization of cryptic splice sites in the adjacent exon [45]. The latter study also identified splicing errors associated with zebrafish missense and nonsense variants resulting in frameshift mutants [45]. Sequence variants in genomic DNA causing aberrant splicing, and thus pathogenesis, are increasingly becoming apparent in genetic diseases [46]. In fact, we have reported instances of aberrant splicing in RNA from FA patients carrying sequence variants in the coding (nonsense, missense, synonymous) and intronic (indel, SNP) [47, 48] regions. Thus, it is important that the consequences of the putative genomic mutations are characterized at the RNA level, which is critical for proper interpretation of the cause and effect of the variants (genotype-to-phenotype).An ideal way to validate whether a frameshift mutant is indeed null is to demonstrate the absence of the encoded protein. Due to lack of zebrafish antibodies or cross-species reacting antibodies, we could test and show the absence of protein expression in only fancd2 mutants (S4 Fig). However, adopting a recently reported fluorescent mutation reporter assay [31], we were able to validate several other indel variants, as predicted, did result in premature termination of the reading frame (S5 Fig).Cellular hypersensitivity to DEB treatment is a hallmark of FA patients. We tested the response of homozygous knockout mutant embryos for all FA genes to DEB treatment by inbreeding heterozygous fish. We could clearly demonstrate the homozygous knockout specific deformed phenotype for seven genes (Fig 2A). Presence of FA genes transcripts as early as one hpf has been reported earlier [27], and the relevance of maternal mRNA and protein in zebrafish embryos has been well documented [49]. This prompted us to speculate that the presence of maternal mRNA may have protected the embryos for some FA gene mutants from displaying the DEB-treatment associated severe malformations. In fact, by incrossing homozygous knockout fish, we did observe the sensitivity of the embryos to DEB treatment. However, this could only be performed for four mutant lines, as female knockout fish were not available for the rest of the FA genes due to female to male sex reversal phenotype (Fig 5). It is interesting to note that malformations were milder for fancb mutants (Fig 2C), probably due to a transcript variant that would result in an in-frame protein albeit with insertion of nine amino acids (Fig 1). Altogether, we could test mutant lines for 11/17 FA genes, and demonstrate they are indeed nulls as they all showed DEB hypersensitivity.Among the FA gene mouse models, embryonic lethality was reported for Fancd1, Fancn, and Fanco knockouts, and for Fancl in a specific strain background [50, 51]. This is consistent with FA patients carrying pathogenic mutations in FANCD1 and FANCN, which present with severe phenotype and often die at a young age [52, 53]. All four zebrafish fancd1 mutant lines [34, 35, 43], including the one in this study, have been found to be viable. A fifth fancd1 mutant, zeppelin (zep), has been reported recently, which shows lethality between 6 and 10 dpf. The zep was isolated in a forward screen for kidney mutants in zebrafish and identified as a homozygous recessive lethal allele that causes reduced podocyte numbers, deficient filtration, and fluid imbalance [54]. The zep phenotype was found to be due to a mutation located in a splice acceptor site between exons 20 and 21 resulting in aberrant splicing, and encoding a truncated protein lacking the last 451 amino acids. Unlike the zep mutation in intron 20, the mutations in the other four fancd1 knockouts, including ours, are located in exons 8, 10 or 11. It is tempting to speculate that the larval stage lethality in zep may be due to the toxic effects of a truncated protein that lacks the C-terminal DNA binding domain. Alternatively, the non-lethal phenotype in the other three fancd1 mutants may be due to genetic compensation, hypomorphic alleles, and/or partial complementation by the proteins encoded by the splice variants [55, 56]. We did observe a small fraction of in-frame deletion transcripts in our fancd1 mutant fish. Only a true fancd1 null lacking complete expression of RNA would provide an unambiguous reliable null phenotype.Except for the fancp-/- fish, where both alleles show smaller body length, visible gross developmental abnormalities were not observed in any other FA gene mutant fish. Co-mutation in fancq did not alter this fancp phenotype. Incidentally, Fancp null mice show similar reduced growth and are born at sub-Mendelian ratios [57]. Growth retardation was observed in mice null for Fanca, Fancc and Fancd2 in certain genetic backgrounds [50]. Reduced body size of knockouts of FANCP orthologs in both zebrafish and mice models may mimic the short stature observed in ~65% of FA patients [58]. Patients with FANCP mutations are rare, however, all seven patients from five FANCP families reported so far do present with growth retardation [59–61]. It is intriguing that loss-of-function in other FA genes does not result in this phenotype in zebrafish. The lack of other gross developmental changes in FA knockout zebrafish models in our study, or by the other groups, could be due to several reasons: redundancy of the pathway, residual function of the mutant proteins, requirement for concomitant loss-of-function mutation in modifier genes, or lack of environmental challenges in a laboratory setting. Using a DNA damaging chemical challenge to induce gene knockout phenotypes in animal models is often necessary and increasingly adopted in various knockout model studies [62]. Most of the FA mouse KO models, do show genomic instability represented by chromosomal breakage only when the knockouts are exposed to DNA crosslinking agents [50, 51]. Requirement of inactivation of modifier genes was illustrated in mouse Fancd2 mutants that develop severe phenotype when there is a concomitant loss of genes encoding aldehyde catabolism enzymes, ADH and ALDH [63]. Our FA gene knockouts should serve well in future studies in evaluating the effect of modifier genes.We found that female-to-male sex reversal was a common phenotype in FA gene knockouts (Fig 5), which suggests that FA pathway plays an important role in zebrafish gonadogenesis. Interestingly, complete female-to-male sex reversal was reported in fancd1, fancl and fancr knockout fish, and concomitant knockout of tp53 rescued the sex reversal phenotype in all three FA gene knockouts [33–36]. In fact, the sex reversal was demonstrated to be due to increased Tp53-mediated germ cell apoptosis at the critical time during sexual fate determination [33]. We also observed rescue of female-to-male sex reversal phenotype when tp53 null mutation was introduced into fancp knockout fish (Fig 6). Hence, it is tempting to speculate that the sex reversal we observed in all FA gene knockouts may also be due to Tp53-mediated apoptosis of germ cells. Since the sex reversal phenotype was present in all of our mutant lines suggests that the mutants are significantly affecting gene function, consistent with the demonstration that these mutants are indeed null alleles.In FA patients, problems associated with gonadogenesis such as hypogonadism, and infertility are common, particularly male infertility [3, 64], and a recent study identified biallelic loss-of-function FANCM mutations as cause of non-obstructive azoospermia [3, 64]. Previous reports in zebrafish have shown that the homozygous knockouts of fancd1 [34, 35] and fancr [36] develop as infertile males with meiotic arrest in spermatocytes. It is surprising that infertility is not a common phenotype in many other FA gene knockout fish. Our fancd1 mutants confirm the findings from other two mutants but the male infertility phenotype was incomplete. Unlike the complete sterility observed in previously reported fancd1-/- males, the partial sterility phenotype in our fancd1hg45/hg45 male fish could be due to limited complementation by the less abundant cryptic splice variant predicted to encode a protein lacking 29 amino acids (Fig 1D and 1E). Differences in the level of sterility in fancd1 knockouts could also result from different target mutation sites (exon 10 in our study vs exons 8 and 11 in others). We also report infertility in fancj-/- males but in only one of the two alleles, and the molecular basis for this allelic discrepancy is not clear.Our data clearly demonstrate how phenotypes for a gene knockout can vary for different mutant alleles located at a target site. Hence, caution in interpreting any phenotype obtained from a single mutant allele is warranted, underscoring the importance of testing multiple mutant alleles, ideally at different target sites, to identify a legitimate phenotype for a gene knockout. Based on our data and others, it appears that three FA gene knockouts in zebrafish (fancd1, fancj, and fancr) lead to male infertility phenotypes [33, 34, 36]. Interestingly, all three genes participate in the homologous recombination process of the FA pathway, suggesting the recombination repair process mediated by the FANC proteins is active during germ cell development, particularly during meiosis, and defects in this activity can lead to infertility. Our study showed that FA pathway genes play a major role in zebrafish gonadogenesis rather than in gametogenesis, suggesting that hypogonadism among FA patients may lead to the observed increased infertility.CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing is a double strand break repair process, either by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or by homologous recombination. The former is exploited for mutagenesis, while the latter has a higher potential for therapeutic intervention. A very recent report demonstrates that homologous recombination repair by single-strand template requires FA pathway genes [65]. Our mutants can be used for further characterization of this process, and hence can play a role in developing genome-editing based therapeutic approaches.Taken together, our study adds 32 zebrafish mutant alleles for 17 FA genes using the efficient CRISPR/cas9 technology and extends to encompass nearly all of the known FA genes. These mutant alleles would serve well in the future for exploration of hematopoietic deficiency to understand the bone marrow failure in FA patients. Viability to adult stage observed for all genes enables us to explore biological processes that otherwise would not have been possible as illustrated by the sex reversal and fertility phenotypes. The FA pathway is critical for maintenance of genome integrity, stem cell maintenance and tumor suppression, among others, and we provide resources to study FA pathogenesis as well as to a better understanding of the underlying basic biological functions.All zebrafish experiments were performed in compliance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for animal handling and research under NHGRI Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) approved protocol G-05-5 assigned to RS and G-17-3 assigned to SCC. Wild-type (WT) zebrafish strain TAB5 was used for all experiments. Zebrafish husbandry, embryo staging and microinjections were performed as described previously [66].Two single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) per gene, using the criteria indicated in S1 Fig legend, were designed using the ‘ZebrafishGenomics’ track on the UCSC Genome Browser. Synthesis of target oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies), preparation of mRNA, microinjections, and mutant generation were carried out as described previously [30, 67]. First, CRISPR-STAT was performed to evaluate target-specific activity of one sgRNA per gene as described previously [41]. Next, second sgRNA was tested for the four genes where the first one showed low to no activity. Mutants were generated by microinjections of pooled sgRNAs to multiple genes (1sgRNA/gene chosen based on the CRISPR-STAT data, two to four genes/injection group) based on their known interactions into the yolk of one cell stage embryos [17–19]. The multiplexing scheme along with the targeted exon and sgRNA sequences for each gene are described in Tables 1 and S1. Injected fish were grown to adulthood and screened for germline transmission of indel mutations by breeding with WT fish. High throughput founder screening was performed by analysis of eight embryos per founder fish for indel mutations by fluorescent PCR for each of the genes in the injection group. Sequence of primers used for fluorescent PCR is given in S1 Table. M13F adapter sequence (5’-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT) was added to the 5’ end of each forward primer, and PIG-tail sequence (5’-GTGTCTT) was added to the 5’ end of each reverse primer as described [42]. Fluorescent PCR (fPCR) was performed using the gene specific primer pair and a universal FAM-labeled M13F primer (5’-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT) as described previously [42, 67]. Same primers were used for CRISPR-STAT, founder screening, identification of heterozygous adult fish from the progeny of selected founders, and for subsequent genotyping to perform genotype-phenotype correlations for all experiments.The RT-PCR primers were designed to amplify the exon containing indel mutation along with its flanking exons (S1 Table). The only exception was fancf, which is a single exon gene and therefore, as a control we performed no-RT reactions during cDNA synthesis to rule out genomic DNA contamination. Caudal fin tissues from adult WT and homozygous knockout fish for each gene were obtained by ACUC approved fin clip method. RNA was extracted using standard TRI Reagent (Ambion) protocol following tissue homogenization with a Ribolyzer (MP Biomedicals). RNA purification was performed using isopropanol precipitation followed by DNase (Qiagen) treatment. RNA was then passed through Zymo clean and concentrator columns (Zymo Research). Random hexamer primer and 1 μg of total RNA were used to synthesize cDNA using Superscript IV First-Strand Synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Upon completion, the reaction mixture was diluted 1:1 with DEPC water, and 4μl of diluted reaction mixture was used as template for RT- PCR reactions using primers for each of the genes (S1 Table). Amplification of actb2 (Forward primer– 5’-GTATCCTGACCCTGAAGTACCC-3’; Reverse primer– 5’-AGCACAGCCTGGATGGCAACG-3’) using 2 μl of diluted reaction mixture was performed as control for cDNA quality. The RT-PCR reactions were performed using KAPA2G Fast HotStart ReadyMix PCR Kit (KAPABIOSYSTEMS) as per manufacturer’s instructions, and the products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels. The RT-PCR products were either sequenced directly in case of single band or sequenced after cloning in case of multiple bands. For Sanger sequencing, the PCR products were treated with USB ExoSAP-IT (Affymetrix), and sequencing reactions were carried out with RT-PCR primers using the Bigdye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) and run on ABI3730XL sequencer. The sequencing data was evaluated by aligning it to Danio rerio reference sequence using Sequencher software (Gene Codes Corporation).This assay was performed as described in a recent report [31]. Briefly, primers were designed to amplify the 5’ UTR and a part of coding sequence that includes the mutation site as recommended (S4 Table). RNA was extracted from heterozygous fish and RT-PCR was performed using the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the following conditions: 50 oC for 30 min, 94 oC for 2 min; 40 cycles of 94 oC for 15 sec, 57 oC for 30 sec, 72 oC for 2 min; 72 oC for 10 min. RT-PCR products were then cloned into the GFP reporter vector and sequence verified to identify WT and mutant clones. As a control, we used the RFP reporter plasmid, pCS2-TagRFPT.zf1 [68]. RNA encoding for GFP and RFP reporters were synthesized using the T3 and SP6 mMessage mMachine kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) respectively, according to manufacture instructions with LiCl precipitation. For each mutation, we injected a mix of RNA for the WT-GFP or mutant-GFP reporter (200pg) with the control RFP reporter (100pg) into 1 cell embryos. Embryos were imaged at 1dpf on a Leica M205 with a Leica DFC7000GT camera and LAS X Imaging Software Suite.The embryos generated from pairwise breeding of single gene and multi-gene heterozygote mutant fish were grown to adulthood (3–6 months). Fin clips from adult fish were processed for DNA extraction using the “Extract-N-Amp” kit (Sigma-Aldrich) and used for genotyping by fluorescent PCR method as described [67]. The genotyping data were used to analyze for Mendelian ratios of surviving homozygous knockout fish compared to the homozygote WT and heterozygous fish. Under the null hypothesis of no viability selection, progeny genotypes should conform to an expected Mendelian ratio of 1:2:1. Deviations from expected number of homozygous knockouts (25%) were tested with goodness-of-fit Chi-square statistical analysis. If the parent fish were heterozygote for mutations in more than one gene, data were analyzed for survival of all possible genotypes expected from these breeding. To get sufficient number of fish genotyped, we analyzed progenies from two breeding for most alleles. To determine the presence of both sexes among surviving adults, all genotyped fish were categorized as males and females and counted.The fertility of homozygous knockout fish for each gene was assessed by breeding them with WT fish. The embryo viability was determined at 24 hpf. If the embryos were viable, 7 embryos were collected to confirm their genotype.Progenies from inbred single or double heterozygote mutant fish were grown to perform standard body length measurements at indicated time period as described [69]. The juvenile fish at 1 mpf were euthanized to perform standard body length measurements and tissue collection for genotyping as described earlier. Adult fish (4 mpf) were genotyped by fin clipping and measured. Standard body length data was grouped based on their genotype and subjected to one-way ANOVA analysis.Zebrafish were euthanized and fixed in 4% formaldehyde at 4°C for a minimum of 24 hours followed by dehydration in 70% ethanol. Specimens were processed for paraffin embedding and preparation of 5 μm H&E-stained sections (Histoserv). Histological section images were captured with an AxioPlan-2 microscope with AxioCam CCD camera (Zeiss) using ZEN imaging software (Zeiss).The embryos obtained from indicated breeding crosses were treated with DEB (Sigma Aldrich) at indicated concentrations in egg water with methylene blue between 4 and 72 hpf. The embryos obtained from heterozygous mutant crosses were separated at the end of treatment into three groups based on the severity of the observed morphological changes (normal, moderate and severe) and genotyped using fPCR as described earlier. Representative images of DEB treated embryos obtained from homozygous mutant inbreeding or outbreeding were taken using LAS X Imaging software on a Leica M205 microscope with a DFC7000 color camera.For Tp53 samples, about twenty-five embryos collected at 24 hpf were dechorionated, deyolked and homogenized in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For Fancd2 samples, soft tissue such as heart, liver, kidney and testis from adult fish were homogenized using TissueRuptor (Qiagen) in cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The homogenates were centrifuged to pellet and remove cellular debris. The samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE (4–15% TGX gels, Bio-Rad) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen). The antibodies for zebrafish Tp53 (Abcam; ab77813), human FANCD2 (Novus Biologicals; NB100-182) and β-actin (Abcam; ab6276) were used at a 1:200, 1:2000 and 1:300 dilutions, respectively.For each targeted gene, human protein marked with known domains (top) and zebrafish protein marked with the targeted site (red line) and predicted mutant amino acid sequences is shown (bottom). Human protein plots were generated using http://www.cbioportal.org/mutation_mapper.jsp. The target site selection criteria included their location in or upstream of a known domain, present in all known isoforms and in a larger exon for design of accurate genotyping primers.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007821.s001(PDF)For each gene partial WT sequence is shown at the top with sgRNA sequence in bold letters and PAM site underlined.

The amplified products were resolved on 2% agarose gel. RT-PCR was designed to amplify the exon containing the indel mutation in knockouts and wild-type fish. Minus RT control was performed for hg50 and hg51 lines due to fancf being a single exon gene. Expected size products were observed for all mutants, except hg41 (fanca), hg42 (fancb), hg45 (fancd1), and hg58 (fancl) mutants, as denoted by the red arrows. Amplicons were sequenced to confirm the mutation, and to determine any aberrant splicing. Multiple products were sequenced after cloning into a vector.

Learn about our remote access optionsAdult triploid zebrafish Danio rerio has previously been reported to be all male. This phenomenon has only been reported in one other gonochoristic fish species, the rosy bitterling Rhodeus ocellatus, despite the fact that triploidy is induced in numerous species. To investigate the mechanism responsible, we first produced triploid zebrafish and observed gonad development. Histological sections of juvenile triploid gonads showed that primary growth oocytes were able to develop in the juvenile ovary, but no cortical alveolus or more advanced oocytes were found. All adult triploids examined were male (n = 160). Male triploids were able to induce oviposition by diploid females during natural spawning trials, but fertilization rates were low (1.0 ± 3.1%) compared with diploid male siblings (67.4 ± 16.6%). The embryos produced by triploid sires were aneuploid with a mean ploidy of 2.4 ± 0.1n, demonstrating that triploid males produce aneuploid spermatozoa. After confirming that adult triploids are all male, we produced an additional batch of triploid zebrafish and exposed them (and a group of diploid siblings) to 100 ng/L estradiol (E2) from 5 to 28 dpf. The E2 treated triploids and nontreated triploids were all male. The nontreated diploids were also all male, but the E2 treated diploids were 89% female. This demonstrates that triploidy acts downstream of estrogen synthesis in the sex differentiation pathway to induce male development. Based on this and the observations of juvenile gonad development in triploids, we suggest that triploidy inhibits development of oocytes past the primary growth stage, and this causes female to male sex reversal.Volume85, Issue7July 2018Pages 612-621© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Advanced SearchEdited by David C. Page, Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, MA, and approved April 17, 2018 (received for review January 23, 2018)Sex determination involves antagonistic interactions between the testis-determining (SRY-SOX9-FGF9) and ovary-promoting (RSPO1-WNT/β-catenin-FOXL2) pathways, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We show that ZNRF3, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that inhibits WNT signaling and is a direct target of RSPO1-mediated membrane clearance, is testis-determining in mice. Testis determination defects in the absence of ZNRF3 arise due to ectopic canonical WNT signaling in XY gonads at the sex-determining stage. We identify human ZNRF3 sequence variants in cases of 46,XY disorders of sex development with XY female presentation. In vitro functional assays show that these variants disrupt ZNRF3 function. Our data reveal a sex-determining role for ZNRF3 and indicate that interactions between ZNRF3 and RSPO1 regulate mammalian sex determination.Mammalian sex determination is controlled by the antagonistic interactions of two genetic pathways: The SRY-SOX9-FGF9 network promotes testis determination partly by opposing proovarian pathways, while RSPO1/WNT-β-catenin/FOXL2 signals control ovary development by inhibiting SRY-SOX9-FGF9. The molecular basis of this mutual antagonism is unclear. Here we show that ZNRF3, a WNT signaling antagonist and direct target of RSPO1-mediated inhibition, is required for sex determination in mice. XY mice lacking ZNRF3 exhibit complete or partial gonadal sex reversal, or related defects. These abnormalities are associated with ectopic WNT/β-catenin activity and reduced Sox9 expression during fetal sex determination. Using exome sequencing of individuals with 46,XY disorders of sex development, we identified three human ZNRF3 variants in very rare cases of XY female presentation. We tested two missense variants and show that these disrupt ZNRF3 activity in both human cell lines and zebrafish embryo assays. Our data identify a testis-determining function for ZNRF3 and indicate a mechanism of direct molecular interaction between two mutually antagonistic organogenetic pathways.Mammalian sex determination involves the sexually dimorphic development of a gonadal primordium. In the presence of SRY on the Y chromosome, supporting cell precursors of the developing gonad differentiate into Sertoli cells, and this somatic lineage orchestrates morphological events required for testis determination (reviewed in refs. 1 and 2). Thus, the “decision” as to whether supporting cells develop as Sertoli (testicular) or granulosa (ovarian) cells is pivotal to sex determination, and understanding the molecular events that result in fate specification of this lineage remains critical to our understanding of gonadogenesis.SRY acts to up-regulate the expression of the testis-determining gene SOX9 (3), a transcription factor that initiates a program of gene activity that directs Sertoli cell differentiation (4, 5). The timing of these protestis events is crucial: Any delay in the expression of Sry can result in sex reversal or ovotestis development in XY mice (6). Studies have shown that the testis-determining genetic pathway is important for the inhibition of the equivalent ovarian-determining pathway. Indeed, the two pathways, most notably FGF signaling in the testis and canonical WNT signaling in the ovary, act in a mutually antagonistic fashion (7). This mutual antagonism persists in the adult gonad: Postnatal deletion of genes such as DMRT1 (8) and FOXL2 (9) can result in reprogramming of cells of the adult testis and ovary, respectively, to the alternative sexual fate.Canonical WNT/β-catenin signals are required for normal ovarian development from the embryonic XX gonad: Loss of WNT4 or Rspondin-1 (RSPO1), which effect such signals through stabilization of β-catenin, can result in partial XX gonadal sex reversal in mice and 46,XX testicular disorders of sex development (DSD) or virilization in humans (10⇓⇓⇓–14). Mechanistically, R-spondins, in association with LGR4/5 cell surface receptors, promote WNT signaling by binding to and sequestering the transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases ZNRF3 and RNF43; these two molecules, in turn, inhibit WNT signaling by targeting Frizzled receptor for degradation by ubiquitination and increased membrane turnover (15⇓⇓⇓–19). Loss of function genetic studies show that testis determination requires the inhibition of proovarian canonical WNT/β-catenin signals (7, 20), and these observations are consistent with the report that ectopic stabilization of β-catenin in transgenic XY mice can disrupt testis development (21). However, the molecular effectors of this inhibition of WNT/β-catenin during testis determination have not been identified. Components of the core sex-determining pathways are only very rarely identified, but, given their inhibition by RSPO1 in other contexts, ZNRF3 and RNF43 are excellent candidates for gene products that act to inhibit canonical WNT signaling during sex determination to tilt the balance toward the testicular fate.Here, we report testis determination defects, including gonadal sex reversal, in mice lacking ZNRF3. In contrast, RNF43 is not required for testis determination. Loss of ZNRF3 results in ectopic canonical WNT signaling in XY gonads at the sex-determining stage of 11.5 days post coitum (dpc) and a consequent reduction in Sox9 expression. We also report variants in human ZNRF3 associated with 46, XY DSD and show that two missense substitutions identified can disrupt ZNRF3’s anti-WNT activity in a cell line and zebrafish embryos. Our data reveal an antagonistic molecular interaction, between RSPO1 and ZNRF3, at the heart of the sex-determining mechanism.We examined Znrf3 expression in somatic (Sf1(Nr5a1)-positive) cells of the developing XY and XX gonads between 10.5 and 16.5 dpc using single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). This revealed early Znrf3 expression in progenitor cells and supporting cells in both sexes, but with no significant sexual dimorphism before 13.5 dpc, by which time primary sex determination is complete. In contrast, Sox9 expression was enhanced in XY supporting cells and Rspo1 expression was enhanced in XX supporting cells from around 11.5 dpc (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 B and C), as previously described (12). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses of Znrf3 expression in XY and XX Sf1-positive cells and whole gonads at 11.5 dpc also revealed no sexual dimorphism (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 D and E). These data indicate that ZNRF3 activity in developing gonadal somatic cells may be regulated in a sexually dimorphic fashion primarily due to the enhanced expression of Rspo1 in XX supporting cells: ZNRF3 activity is predicted to be higher in XY cells than in XX cells due to RSPO1-mediated membrane clearance in XX cells.We then tested directly whether loss of ZNRF3 disrupted testis determination in the mouse. XY fetal gonads homozygous for a Znrf3 null allele (16) on the C57BL/6J (B6) background exhibited pronounced defects in testis determination with variable severity at 14.5 dpc (Fig. 1). The most severely affected appeared sex-reversed, with an ovarian morphology characterized by the absence of Sox9 expression and patchy Stra8 expression throughout (Fig. 1 A and B). Stra8 expression is indicative of germ cell meiotic entry, normally only detectable in XX gonads at this stage. Other mutants developed ovotestes, with only particular regions of the gonad expressing significant Stra8 or Sox9. The least affected class exhibited disruption to morphology with irregular testis cords and restricted areas containing Stra8-positive cells. XY mutant gonads had significant numbers of FOXL2-positive cells, depending on the degree of sex reversal, indicating ovarian granulosa cell differentiation (Fig. 1 A and B). Significantly, phenotypic variability in the degree of sex reversal was observed between gonads of an individual mutant fetus at 14.5 dpc (Fig. 1C), indicating innate phenotypic stochasticity in the absence of ZNRF3, in addition to any contributions made by residual genetic background differences.Testis determination defects in XY gonads lacking ZNRF3. (A) Wild-type controls. (B) XY gonads (14.5 dpc) lacking ZNRF3 exhibit severe morphological abnormalities in comparison with wild-type controls. WMISH with Sox9 (Top, upper row) reveals mutant gonads with a sex-reversed (ovarian) morphology (left and center) and either a major reduction in levels of Sox9 or no detectable expression. Less affected gonads have higher Sox9 levels but abnormal testis cords (right). WMISH with Stra8 (Top, lower row) reveals a significant number of meiotic germ cells in ZNRF3-deficient gonads. Gonadal sex reversal in XY gonads lacking ZNRF3 is confirmed by immunostaining of 14.5 dpc gonadal sections for AMH (red), a Sertoli cell marker, and FOXL2 (green), a granulosa cell marker (Bottom). (C) Pairs of gonads dissected from individual Znrf3 fetuses (14.5 dpc) exhibit asymmetry. Note rudimentary testis cord formation in one gonad (asterisk), but not the other (Left). Center shows distinct Sox9 expression profiles in two fetal gonads. Right shows, remarkably, an ovary on one side and a well-formed testis on the other. (Scale bar, 250 μm.)We also examined the consequences of loss of ZNRF3 for XY gonad development on the B6.YAKR genetic background, which is highly sensitized to disruptions to testis determination due to the presence of the Mus domesticus AKR Y chromosome (22, 23). Embryos lacking ZNRF3 on B6.YAKR consistently exhibited complete gonadal sex reversal, having an ovarian morphology and lacking Sox9 expression and often containing large numbers of Stra8-positive cells (Fig. 2A). Heterozygous embryos lacking just a single copy of Znrf3 also had severe gonadal defects, but with variable severity (Fig. 2B). Some developed ovotestes, with central gonadal Sox9 expression, some exhibited Sox9 expression but lacked testis cords, and others had an ovarian morphology with no detectable Sox9 expression. Adult B6.YAKR heterozygous mice are viable, unlike homozygotes, which die at around birth (15). B6.YAKR adult heterozygotes exhibited a range of gonadal abnormalities; remarkably, a minority (2/5) developed as phenotypic XY females with internal genitalia and anogenital distances grossly similar to XX controls (Fig. 2C and SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Others either contained an ovary-like gonad on one side and a very small contralateral testis or contained two small testes (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). These data establish ZNRF3 as testis-determining in the mouse. In contrast, B6 XY embryos lacking the functionally related paralogue RNF43 (16, 18, 24) develop testes as normal (SI Appendix, Fig. S4).Znrf3 mutants exhibit gonadal sex reversal phenotypes on B6.YAKR. (A) B6.YAKR embryonic gonads lacking ZNRF3 at 13.5 (Right, upper row) and 14.5 dpc (Right, lower row) have an ovarian morphology. They lack Sox9 expression and have variable numbers of Stra8-positive germ cells. Stra8 is also expressed in a more restricted and transient fashion at the poles of the B6.YAKR wild-type controls (Left, lower row). Sox9 expression is expressed in testis cords of controls (Left, upper row). (B) Fetal XY gonads lacking a single functional copy of Znrf3 exhibit variable degrees of sex reversal, revealed by Sox9 WMISH (upper row) and Stra8 WMISH (lower row). (C) Female phenotypic sex in an adult B6.YAKR mouse lacking one copy of Znrf3 (Top, center). Sex-reversed animals have an anogenital distance (vertical white bar) usually found in XX controls. Mammary gland pigmentation is also visible in the XY female mouse (center). Examination of internal genitalia in XY heterozygotes reveals uterine horns and bilateral ovaries (Bottom, center). [Scale bar, 500 μm (A and B); 1 cm (C, Top, in black); 0.5 cm (C, Bottom, in white).]To determine the basis of the observed testis determination defects at 14.5 dpc, we performed molecular analyses around the time of sex determination, from 11.5 dpc to 12.5 dpc, in XY Znrf3 mutant gonads and controls. No overt disruption to Sry expression was detected by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3A). In contrast, Sox9 expression was either reduced or absent compared with XY controls (Fig. 3 B and C). These data suggest that disruption to Sox9, rather than Sry, accounts for the failure to undergo normal testis determination in homozygous XY embryos. Gonadal somatic cell proliferation was also reduced in Znrf3 mutants at 11.5 dpc, consistent with their feminization (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). We then tested whether disruption to Sox9 expression is caused by elevated canonical WNT signaling in XY mutant gonads due to the absence of ZNRF3-mediated clearance of Frizzled receptor. Lef1, which is positively regulated by WNT/β-catenin signals, was detected at higher levels in XY mutant homozygotes than XY controls at both 11.5 and 12.5 dpc (Fig. 3 D and F). Similarly, Axin2 levels were also elevated in XY gonads lacking ZNRF3 (Fig. 3E). By contrast, expression of the somatic cell marker Sf1 and the primordial germ cell marker Oct4 were not affected at 12.5 dpc (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). Interestingly, proovarian Wnt4 expression was enhanced by loss of ZNRF3, both at 11.5 and 12.5 dpc, with noticeable variability in expression levels between distinct mutant XY gonads (Fig. 3G and SI Appendix, Fig. S6). These data suggest that testis determination defects in XY gonads lacking ZNRF3 are caused by ectopic canonical WNT signaling resulting in significant reduction in levels of Sox9 in supporting cell precursors at 11.5 dpc. The inhibitory effect of β-catenin on gonadal Sox9 expression has been previously reported and explained by disruption to SF-1−mediated activation of its gonad-specific enhancer, testis-specific enhancer core (TESCO) (25), although disruption to other Sox9 enhancers is conceivable (26). SRY-dependent promotion of SOX9 transcription may sometimes tilt the balance toward the testicular fate in XY mutants, generating an inherently unstable sex-determining network, accounting for some of the phenotypic variability observed.Ectopic activation of canonical WNT signaling and disruption to Sox9 expression during sex determination in XY Znrf3 homozygotes. (A) The qRT-PCR shows that Sry is expressed in Znrf3 homozygous mutant embryos at 11.5 dpc with no significant difference to controls. (B) The qRT-PCR showing Sox9 expression is significantly reduced in mutants. (C) Reduced Sox9 expression is observed in some mutant gonads (left-hand mutant) following WMISH, while expression is negligible in others. Sox9 expression in XY control gonads is strong. (D) WMISH shows Lef1 expression is elevated in XY homozygous mutant gonads at 11.5 dpc. (E) Expression of Axin2 is also elevated in XY homozygous mutant gonads at 12.5 dpc, although not to XX control levels. (F) Lef1 expression is also clearly detectable in XY homozygotes at 12.5 dpc, in contrast to controls. (G) Expression of Wnt4 is also elevated in XY homozygotes at 12.5 dpc, although, again, not to XX control levels. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. NS, not significant.Finally, we tested whether ZNRF3 mutations might disrupt human sexual development, by performing next-generation sequencing of whole exomes from a cohort of patients with very rare 46,XY DSD (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Supplementary Methods). We identified two novel ZNRF3 variants and two known variants in five individuals, including four with 46,XY female presentation (Table 1). No other DSD-associated variants were present in these patients. We then assessed the functional consequences of two of the missense variants. Human cell line transfection assays (Fig. 4A) and zebrafish embryo assays (Fig. 4B) indicate that the Ser554Asn amino acid substitution (patient 2, 46,XY complete gonadal dysgenesis) disrupts the ability of ZNRF3 to inhibit canonical WNT signals compared with wild-type ZNRF3. Both assays also demonstrated that the Arg768Gly substitution (patients 3 and 4, 46,XY DSD of unknown gonadal phenotype) acts to enhance WNT/β-catenin signaling (Fig. 4). Thus, both human variants tested can disrupt ZNRF3’s role in inhibiting canonical WNT signals in both a cellular and organismal context.ZNRF3 variants detected by exome sequencing of DSD patientsHuman ZNRF3 variants disrupt ZNRF3 activity. (A) Effects of overexpressing wild-type and variant ZNRF3 on WNT/β-catenin signaling was tested by SuperTOPFlash luciferase reporter assay in KGN (ovarian granulosa cell tumor) cells for 48 h. The reporter constructs were transfected into KGN cells with either the empty vector (EV), wild-type (WT), or variant ZNRF3 expression vectors. The values are expressed relative to ZNRF3-WT. Each data point represents the mean of the value of each experiment ± SEM (n = four independent experiments; each experimental measurement was performed in quadruplicate). Pairwise comparison between the effect of ZNRF3-WT and all of the other conditions was performed using a two-tailed Student t test. ***P ≤ 0.0001. (B) Lateral views of 58-h postfertilization uninjected control (i and v) or injected (12.5 pg, ii–iv; 50 pg, vi–viii) zebrafish embryos. Embryos injected with 12.5 pg of ZNRF3-WT or ZNRF3-S554N show no defects, but ZNRF3-R768G−injected embryos display reduction of the forebrain and either loss (iv) or reduction (Inset in iv) of the eyes. At the 50-pg dose, ZNRF3-WT embryos displayed dorsalization (vi), while ZNRF3-S554N−injected embryos showed no axis patterning defects (vii). At 50 pg, ZNRF3-R768G−injected embryos exhibited posteriorization of anterior structures (viii).Here we report detailed analysis of a developmental role for ZNRF3, a known tumor suppressor (27, 28). The testis determination defects described here in ZNRF3-deficient fetuses are associated with a clear elevation of canonical WNT signaling in the developing XY gonad, consistent with the known role of ZNRF3 in increasing membrane turnover of Frizzled receptor and thereby inhibiting WNT signaling (15, 16). The basis of the sex reversal phenotypes observed at 14.5 dpc is the reduction of Sox9 seen at 11.5 dpc, when commitment to either the testicular or ovarian fate is decided. The simplest explanation of this loss of Sox9 expression is the elevation in canonical WNT signals: In other genetic contexts, forcing stabilization of β-catenin can disrupt testis determination (21). Phenotypic variability in the severity of the XY gonadal defects in mutants indicates a degree of instability in the sex-determining mechanism in the absence of ZNRF3; however, while the Znrf3 mutant line was maintained on C57BL/6J for several generations, we cannot exclude residual genetic background differences as a contributory factor. It is worth noting here too that large-scale phenotypic studies of mouse knockouts reveal that incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity are common even on pure genetic backgrounds (29). This phenomenon, like pronounced phenotypic variability between the gonads of a single fetus (Fig. 3C), cannot clearly be explained by genetic mechanisms.The role of ZNRF3 in testis determination and that of RSPO1 in ovary development (12⇓–14) indicates an antagonistic molecular interaction at the heart of mammalian gonad development (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Our studies suggest that Znrf3 is expressed at equivalent levels in supporting cells of the XY and XX gonads at the time of sex determination. This suggests that Znrf3 is not an obvious target for transcriptional up-regulation by testis-determining factors such as SRY, SOX9, or FGF9, despite the known role of FGF signals in opposing WNT signals in the mouse (7, 20). We do not, of course, rule out posttranscriptional mechanisms of activation. RSPO1 promotes WNT signaling by inducing membrane clearance of ZNRF3, and the related molecule RNF43 (17), and given the elevated levels of Rspo1 in the XX gonad at the sex-determining stage, we conclude that ZNRF3 activity is reduced in XX supporting cells and therefore elevated in XY cells. In XY cells, ZNRF3 acts to inhibit canonical WNT signaling by increasing membrane turnover of Frizzled receptor, and the consequences of removing that inhibition in the XY gonad are the testis determination defects described here, mediated by suppression of Sox9 expression. Thus, during gonad development, RSPO1 acts to inhibit an inhibitor of canonical WNT signaling, a double-negative operation that is familiar in models of sex determination (30). While loss of RSPO1 results in masculinization of the XX supporting cell lineage only in the postnatal period, this may be due to a number of factors, including the availability of proovarian FOXL2 and/or other pro-WNT signaling factors, the complexity of the ovarian somatic cell lineages, or the contribution of germ cells to ovary development (13, 31, 32). It will be interesting to determine the consequences of removal of both ZNRF3 and RSPO1 on XX and XY gonad development. Likewise, it will be interesting to determine the consequences of Znrf3 overexpression on XX gonad development.We report that two human ZNRF3 variants, associated with 46,XY DSD and causing amino acid substitutions, can disrupt the role of ZNRF3 in inhibiting canonical WNT signaling. All variants detected map to the long intracellular domain of ZNRF3, the function of which is unclear (24). Affected individuals are heterozygous carriers of each variant identified, and not all are novel. However, in this context, it is very important to reconsider the role played by genetic background in the penetrance and expressivity of sex determination phenotypes. Sex reversal in some B6.YAKR mice lacking just one copy of Znrf3 suggests that heterozygosity for a disruptive ZNRF3 mutation may be sufficient to cause 46,XY DSD, including complete gonadal dysgenesis, in the relevant human genetic background. Taken together, our data establish a testis-determining function for ZNRF3. ZNRF3 inhibits canonical WNT signaling in XY gonads during sex determination, permitting the establishment of robust Sox9 expression. Our data reveal a molecular conflict between ZNRF3 and RSPO1 that governs mammalian sex determination.Mice used were bred with licensed approval from the UK Home Office (PPL 30/2877 and 70/8988). Mice were housed in individually ventilated cages in a specific pathogen-free environment. Mice harboring Znrf3 and Rnf43 floxed alleles have been previously described (16). Sf1-eGFP reporter mice (33) were a kind gift from J. Bowles and P. Koopman (University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia). All lines were maintained on C57BL/6J (B6) for at least six generations.Noon on the day of the copulatory plug was counted as 0.5 dpc. Embryos collected at 11.5 dpc were staged accurately based on the number of tail somites. Whole-mount in situ hybridization (WMISH) analysis of embryonic tissues and probes for Sox9, Wnt4, and Stra8 have been previously described (34).

At least three independent biological samples from a given group were analyzed with a particular marker.Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy plus micro kit (Qiagen), and reverse transcription (RT) was carried out with 250 ng of total RNA using the High capacity cDNA RT kit (Applied Biosystems). The qRT-PCR was performed with Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Life Technologies) on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). RNA expression levels were normalized to those of Hrpt1 (endogenous control) using the ΔΔCt method. At least three samples for each genotype were analyzed.

At least two independent biological replicates for each sex and genotype were analyzed in immunohistochemistry experiments.Dams were injected with 9 mg/kg 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (C10339; Thermofisher) and killed 1 h later. Gonads/mesonephroi were dissected from embryos and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 h at 4 °C or 2 h at room temperature. Gonads underwent Click-iT chemistry according to manufacturer’s instructions. GATA4 immunostaining was then performed before imaging using a Zeiss 710 multiphoton microscope.The wild-type ZNRF3 construct (ZNRF3-HA) has been previously described (15). Point mutations were generated using site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit; Agilent) according to manufacturer’s instructions. T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) binding-site/mutated binding-site (TOPFlash/FOPFlash) reporter plasmids (M50 Super 8x TOPFlash and M51 Super 8x FOPFlash mutant; Addgene) were used for the detection of β-catenin−driven WNT transcriptional activity. See SI Appendix for further details.To determine the effect of human variants on ZNRF3 function, we used an overexpression assay in zebrafish that assesses the impact of low (12.5 pg) and high (50 pg) doses of injected ZNRF3 messenger RNA on early embryogenesis. Plasmids containing ZNRF3-HA were mutagenized using the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent) to incorporate the S554N and R768G point mutations.

Knockouts of Foxl2 and Cyp19a1 in goat, mouse, and zebrafish have revealed similar but not identical functions across species. Functional analyses of these two genes in other animals are needed to elucidate their conserved roles in vertebrate sexual development. In this study, we established foxl2 and cyp19a1a mutant lines in Nile tilapia. Both foxl2−/− and cyp19a1a−/− XX fish displayed female-to-male sex reversal. Sf1, Dmrt1, and Gsdf were upregulated in the foxl2−/− and the cyp19a1a−/− XX gonads. Downregulation of Cyp19a1a and serum estradiol-17β level, and upregulation of Cyp11b2 and serum 11-ketotestosterone level were observed in foxl2−/− XX fish. The mutant phenotype of foxl2−/− XX individuals could be rescued by 17β-estradiol treatment from 5 to 30 days after hatching (dah). Upregulation of Star1, the enzyme involved in androgen production in tilapia, was also observed in the foxl2−/− XX gonad at 30 and 90 dah. In vitro promoter analyses consistently demonstrated that Foxl2 could suppress the transcription of star1 in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, compared with the control XX gonad, fewer germ cells were detected in the foxl2−/− XX, cyp19a1a−/− XX, and control XY gonads 10 dah. These results demonstrate that Foxl2 promotes ovarian development by upregulating Cyp19a1a expression and repressing male pathway gene expression. These results extend the study of Foxl2 and Cyp19a1a loss of function to a commercially important fish species.Forkhead box protein L2 (Foxl2), a member of the Fox gene family, is involved in ovarian differentiation and oogenesis in vertebrates (1). It is a transcription factor characterized by an evolutionary well-conserved DNA binding domain known as the Fox domain, which contains 80 to 100 amino acids (2). The involvement of Foxl2 in ovarian development was first demonstrated in type I blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome, which causes premature ovarian failure in women (3). Foxl2 is also involved in the polled intersex syndrome in goats (Capra hircus), where a natural deletion of 300 kb extinguishes Foxl2 ovarian expression and triggers female-to-male sex reversal (4). Subsequent studies have confirmed that Foxl2 is a crucial female reproductive factor. Experimental knockout of Foxl2 also triggers XX sex reversal in goats, demonstrating that this is a key ovarian determining gene (5). It has been concluded that Foxl2 is necessary for the development of the ovary and for maintaining its fate throughout life by preventing the expression of male cues (5). Foxl2 knockout experiments have also been performed in mouse (Mus musculus) (6, 7). Loss of Foxl2 function in the female mouse triggered sterility: the ovaries were small and disorganized where primary follicles were not formed and could not complete maturation (7). FoxL2 is also highly expressed in the ovary of birds (8), reptiles (9–11), and amphibians (12–14), suggesting a conserved function for Foxl2 among tetrapods.Fishes are the largest group of vertebrates and provide valuable comparative material for studying the function of genes in sexual development. Foxl2 genes have been cloned from numerous fishes (15–20). In almost every species studied, foxl2 showed sexually dimorphic expression in the differentiating and adult gonads, with higher expression in ovaries compared with testes (15, 16, 21–24). Like mammals, fish foxl2 is expressed predominantly in the ovary granulosa cells (16, 18, 25, 26), which are likely to be the primary source of circulating estrogens, the key hormone involved in fish ovarian development. Foxl2 expression was detected at the critical time for sex determination, 5 days after hatching (dah), in tilapia and willow minnow (Gnathopogon caerulescens) (25, 27). Moreover, very high foxl2 expression was detected even as early as the gastrula stage in half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) (17). Foxl2 was reported to be a regulator of cytochrome P450 aromatase (Cyp19a1a), the key enzyme involved in the synthesis of estrogens, in tilapia and Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) (25, 28).These studies led us to hypothesize that Foxl2 functions to determine and maintain ovarian development via estrogen synthesis in fish. In our previous studies, overexpression of the Foxl2 dominant-negative mutant in XX tilapia triggered female-to-male sex reversal, suggesting that Foxl2 acts as an antitestis gene (25). Consistently, female-to-male sex reversal was also observed in Foxl2 knockdown tilapia (29). Recently, mutation of both foxl2 and cyp19a1a has been reported in zebrafish (Danio rerio), and female-to-male sex reversal was observed for both homozygotes (30–32).Nile tilapia, a gonochoristic fish with an XX/XY sex-determining system, with well-studied developmental pattern of gonads and available genetic all-XX and all-XY fish, provides an excellent model for studying sex determination and differentiation (33–37). Recently, genome editing tools (29, 38) and genome sequences (39) have been reported in tilapia. Here, we report the establishment of foxl2 and cyp19a1a mutant lines in Nile tilapia. We found that foxl2−/− and cyp19a1a−/− XX fish each developed as male. We then analyzed gonadal gene expression, germ cell number, and serum 17β-estradiol (E2) and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) levels in the mutant and control fish.Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) were kept in recirculating, aerated freshwater tanks at 26°C under a natural photoperiod. Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the regulations of the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Committee of Laboratory Animal Experimentation at Southwest University.The tilapia foxl2 and cyp19a1a F0 XX mutants (foxl2 F0 and cyp19a1a F0) were generated by TALEN-induced gene mutation (29). XY female (foxl2+/+ and cyp19a1a+/+) were obtained by E2 (200-μg/g diet; Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany) treatment from 5 to 30 dah, as reported previously (37). F1 offspring were produced by crossing F0 XX males with sex-reversed wild-type XY females. Male and female siblings of the heterozygous F1 mutants (i.e., foxl2+/− and cyp19a1a+/−) carrying the same mutation were mated to generate homozygous F2 mutants (foxl2−/− and cyp19a1a−/−). Heteroduplex mobility assays were performed using polyacrylamide gels electrophoresis to detect the mutations, as reported previously (40). Primer sequences used for mutant screening are listed in Supplemental Table 1. In-frame and frame-shift deletions were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The sex of each fish was determined by genotyping with a sex-linked DNA marker (40).Six fish of each genotype, foxl2−/−, foxl2+/−, cyp19a1a−/−, cyp19a1a+/− XX fish, and control XX and XY (foxl2+/+ and cyp19a1a+/+) were analyzed. Gonads were dissected at 5, 30, and 90 dah, and then fixed in Bouin’s solution for 24 hours at room temperature, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Tissue blocks were cut into 5-μm sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or used for immunohistochemical analysis. Antibodies against Sf1 [research resource identifier (RRID): AB_2650454], Dmrt1 (RRID: AB_2650456), Gsdf (RRID: AB_2650457), Cyp11b2 (RRID: AB_2650466), and Star1 (RRID: AB_2650467) were prepared in our laboratory. The specificity of these antibodies has been analyzed previously (37, 40–43). The Cyp19a1a antibody (RRID: AB_2629226) was a gift from Prof. Yoshitaka Nagahama, National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan (44). Antibodies against Sf1, Dmrt1, Gsdf, Cyp19a1a, Cyp11b2, and Star1 were diluted at 1:1000, 1:100, 1:1000, 1:3000, 1:500, and 1:1000, respectively.Three parallel samples (each composed of gonads from six individuals) were prepared from foxl2−/−, foxl2+/−, cyp19a1a−/−, cyp19a1a+/− XX fish, and control XX and XY fish at 90 dah to evaluate gene expression. Total proteins were extracted from gonads and diluted to a final concentration of 20 mg/mL and stored at −20°C until use. Western blots for Sf1, Dmrt1, Gsdf, Cyp19a1a, Cyp11b2, and Star1 were performed as reported previously (40). The gene expression levels were measured by densitometry with Fusion-CAPT software (Vilber Lourmat, Marne-la-Vallée, France) and normalized using α-tubulin (RRID: AB_2619646) as the reference protein.Three parallel samples (each composed of gonads from six individuals) were prepared from foxl2−/−, foxl2+/−, cyp19a1a−/−, cyp19a1a+/− XX fish, and control XX and XY fish at 90 dah. Total RNAs were extracted and treated with Dnase I (Takara, Shiga, Japan) to eliminate genomic DNA contamination. First-strand cDNAs were synthesized using PrimeScript RT Master Mix Perfect Real Time Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Takara). Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed on an ABI-7500 real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the protocol of SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM II (Takara). Primer sequences used for qRT-PCR are listed in Supplemental Table 1. The efficiency and specificity of primers used for qRT-PCR have been evaluated previously (41, 45, 46). The relative abundances of mRNA transcripts were evaluated using the following formula: R = 2-△△Ct (47). The arithmetic mean of the copy number of the three reference genes (β-actin, gapdh, and eef1a1) was used to normalize the expression values.Blood samples were collected from groups of six fish of each genotype (foxl2−/−, foxl2+/−, cyp19a1a−/−, cyp19a1a+/− XX fish, and control XX and XY fish). Blood was collected from the caudal vein at 90 dah and centrifuged at 10,000g for 5 minutes at 4°C. The sera were collected and stored at −20°C until use. Serum E2 and 11-KT levels were measured using the Enzyme Immunoassay Kit (Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Before measuring the samples, linearity of the assays was checked in serial dilutions of three samples from the XX and XY control group (Supplemental Fig. 1).The foxl2−/− XX fish were divided into an E2-treatment group and a control group. The treatment fish were fed a diet sprayed with 95% ethanol containing E2 at 200 μg/g feed, as reported previously (40), whereas control fish were fed a diet sprayed with 95% ethanol only. The treatment was applied from 5 to 30 dah, then both groups were fed a normal diet until 60 dah. The gonads of six fish from each treatment group were sampled at 60 dah for histology analyses.Tilapia star1 gene sequences were obtained from the Nile tilapia genome assembly Orenil1.0 (http://asia.ensembl.org/Oreochromis_niloticus/Info/Index). In silico analyses of Foxl2 binding sites within the 2-kb sequence upstream of the ATG initiation codon were performed by searching of the consensus cis-regulatory elements [(G/A (T/C) (C/A) A A (C/T)A] (25).Cell culture, transient transfection, and luciferase assay were performed as reported previously (25). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293) were maintained at 5% CO2 at 37°C with Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 IU/mL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL). HEK293 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and the following three plasmids: 500 ng/well of constructs of the star1 promoter (2-kb upstream of the ATG initiation codon) cloned into the pGL3-basic luciferase reporter vector; 0 to 250 ng/well of pcDNA3.1 expression plasmid, containing cDNA encoding Foxl2 (49); and pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI) 100 ng/well. Renilla luciferase from pRL-TK was used as the internal control for transfection efficiency. Cells were seeded into 24-well plates the day before so that the population was 95% confluent on the day of transfection. The transfection solution consisted of 100 μL of Opti-MEM I reduced-serum medium (Gibco) containing precomplexed DNA and 2 μL of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline 48 hours after transfection, and lysed in 100 μL of luciferase lysis buffer. Firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase readings were obtained using a Luminoskan Ascent luminometer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). Relative luciferase activity was calculated by dividing firefly luciferase activity by Renilla luciferase activity.The gonads of six fish of each genotype (foxl2−/− XX, cyp19a1a−/− XX fish, control XX and XY fish) were dissected at 10 dah, fixed in Bouin’s solution for 24 hours at room temperature, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Tissue blocks were sectioned longitudinally at 5 μm and used for immunohistochemical analysis. Antibody against Vasa (RRID: AB_2650465), a gift from Prof. Yoshitaka Nagahama, National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan (48), was diluted at 1:1000. The germ cell numbers were estimated as the number of Vasa-positive cells. The number of germ cells was counted for the foxl2−/− XX, cyp19a1a−/− XX, control XX, and control XY gonads. Total RNAs were extracted from the gonads of 20 fish from each genotype (foxl2−/− XX, cyp19a1a−/− XX, control XX, and control XY) at 10 dah and treated with Dnase I to eliminate the genomic DNA contamination. The relative vasa expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR as described previously. The primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Table 1. The efficiency and specificity of the primers have been evaluated previously (41).Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Significant differences in the data between groups were tested by one-way analysis of variance with a post hoc test. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.The F0 foxl2-positive mutant fish were obtained as reported previously (29). F1 mutant fish were obtained by crossing an F0 XX male with a sex-reversed, wild-type XY female. Heterozygous foxl2 F1 offspring with a 2-bp deletion in the exon were selected to breed the F2 generation (Supplemental Fig. 2). This frame-shift mutation resulted in the premature termination of Foxl2 translation on the Fox domain (Supplemental Fig. 2). A heteroduplex mobility assay identified the heterozygous foxl2+/− individuals as those possessing both heteroduplex and homoduplex amplicons vs the foxl2+/+ and foxl2−/− individuals with only homoduplex amplicons (Supplemental Fig. 3). The sex of F2 fish was genotyped by a sex-linked DNA marker (Supplemental Fig. 3).We analyzed the sex phenotype of F2 offspring at 90 dah. The foxl2+/− XX and foxl2+/+ XX fish developed as female and the foxl2−/− XX and foxl2+/+ XY fish developed as male [Fig. 1(a)]. immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses revealed that Sf1, Dmrt1, and Gsdf (male-dominant genes) were upregulated in foxl2−/− XX gonads, compared with foxl2+/− XX gonads, which displayed no difference to the control XX gonads [Fig. 1(a-c); Supplemental Fig. 4). On the other hand, qRT-PCR showed that the expressions of β-cat1, β-cat2, and figla (female-dominant genes) were downregulated in the foxl2−/− XX gonads, similar to the control XY, compared with the foxl2+/− XX and control XX gonads at 90 dah [Fig. 1(d-f)]. No significant differences in fertilization rate were observed between the foxl2−/− XX male and the control XY male fish when mated with normal XX females (Supplemental Fig. 5).Homozygous mutation foxl2 resulted in female-to-male sex reversal in XX tilapia. At 90 dah, the foxl2+/+ XX (C, G, and K) and foxl2+/+ XY (D, H, and L) gonads developed as ovary and testis, respectively, whereas the foxl2−/− XX (A, E, and I) gonad developed as testis and the foxl2+/− XX (B, F, and J) gonad developed as ovary. (a) Immunohistochemistry and (b, c) Western blot analyses revealed that Sf1, Dmrt1, and Gsdf were highly expressed in the foxl2−/− XX and foxl2+/+ XY gonads, whereas in the foxl2+/− and foxl2+/+ XX gonads, Sf1 and Gsdf were expressed weakly and Dmrt1 was not expressed. (d–f) qRT-PCR revealed the expression of β-cat1, β-cat2, and figla in the foxl2−/− XX and foxl2+/+ XY gonads was significantly lower than in the foxl2+/− and foxl2+/+ XX gonads. Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Significant differences in the data between groups were tested by one-way analysis of variance with a post hoc test. Bars bearing different letters indicate significant differences (P < 0.05).The expression of Dmrt1 (a Sertoli cell marker) in the gonad of F2 fish was analyzed at 5 and 30 dah by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Dmrt1 was detected in the foxl2−/− XX and control XY gonads but not in the foxl2+/− XX and control XX gonads (Fig. 2).Dmrt1 was detected in foxl2 homozygous mutant gonads from as early as 5 dah. IHC analyses revealed that Dmrt1 was expressed in the foxl2−/− XX (A and E) and foxl2+/+ XY (D and H) gonads but not in the foxl2+/− (B and F) and foxl2+/+ (C and G) XX gonads at 5 and 30 dah.By IHC, Cyp19a1a was found to be expressed in the control XX and foxl2+/− XX gonads but not in the control XY and foxl2−/− XX gonads at 5, 30, and 90 dah [Fig. 3(a)]. Western blot confirmed the immunohistochemical results at 90 dah [Fig. 3(b) and 3(c); Supplemental Fig. 6]. A significantly lower level of serum E2 was consistently observed in the control XY and foxl2−/− XX fish compared with the control XX and foxl2+/− XX fish [Fig. 3(d)].E2 synthesis was blocked in foxl2 XX homozygous mutants and the phenotype of the mutants could be rescued by E2 treatment. (a) Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that Cyp19a1a was not expressed in the foxl2−/− XX (A, E, and I) and foxl2+/+ XY (D, H, and L) gonads but was expressed in the foxl2+/− (B, F, and J) and foxl2+/+ (C, G, and K) XX gonads at 5, 30, and 90 dah. (b, c) Western blot analyses further confirmed that Cyp19a1a was not expressed in the foxl2−/− XX and foxl2+/+ XY gonads but was expressed in the foxl2+/− and foxl2+/+ XX gonads at 90 dah. (d) Consistently, the serum E2 level in the foxl2−/− XX and foxl2+/+ XY fish was significantly lower than that in the foxl2+/− and foxl2+/+ XX fish at 90 dah. (e) When examined at 60 dah, the E2-treatment (XX foxl2−/− + E2; B) and control XX (C) gonads developed as ovaries, whereas the foxl2−/− XX (A) and control XY (D) gonads developed as testes. Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Significant differences in the data between groups were tested by one-way analysis of variance with a post hoc test. Bars bearing different letters indicate significant differences (P < 0.05).Histologically, all E2-treatment (XX foxl2−/− + E2) and control XX fish developed as female, whereas all foxl2−/− XX and control XY fish developed as male when examined at 60 dah [Fig. 3(e)].Cyp11b2 (the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of 11-KT) expression and serum 11-KT level in the foxl2−/− XX fish were upregulated to a level similar to that of the control XY fish as compared with that of the control XX and foxl2+/− XX fish [Fig. 4(a-d); Supplemental Fig. 7). Star1, controlling the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis, was expressed as expected in the control XY gonads but not in control XX gonads. Star1 expression was observed in the foxl2−/− XX gonads at 30 and 90 dah but not at 5 dah and not in the foxl2+/− XX gonads at 5, 30, and 90 dah [Fig. 4(e)]. Western blots confirmed the immunohistochemical results at 90 dah [Fig. 4(f); Supplemental Fig. 8]. In silico analyses of the tilapia star1 promoter revealed three putative Foxl2 binding sites at −830, −1439, and −1608. Luciferase assay using HEK293 cells revealed that Foxl2 alone can activate star1 transcription in a dose-dependent manner (10 to 250 ng) [Fig. 4(g)].Androgen synthesis was stimulated in the foxl2 XX homozygous mutant. (a) Immunohistochemical and (b, c) Western blot analyses revealed that Cyp11b2 was expressed in the foxl2−/− XX (A) and foxl2+/+ XY (D) gonads but not in the foxl2+/− (B) and foxl2+/+ (C) XX gonads at 90 dah. (d) The serum 11-KT level was significantly higher in the foxl2−/− XX and foxl2+/+ XY fish than that in the foxl2+/− and foxl2+/+ XX fish at 90 dah. (e) IHC revealed Star1 expression in the foxl2−/− XX (A, E, and I) and foxl2+/+ XY (D, H, and L) gonads at 30 and 90 dah but not at 5 dah, and not in the foxl2+/− (B, F, and J) and foxl2+/+ XX gonads at 5, 30, and 90 dah. (f) Western blot analyses revealed that Star1 was expressed in the foxl2−/− XX and foxl2+/+ (C, G, and K) XY gonads but not in the foxl2+/− and foxl2+/+ XX gonads at 90 dah. (g) Three putative Foxl2 binding sites were found in the tilapia star1 promoter and Foxl2 repressed the transcription of star1 in a dose-dependent manner (10 to 250 ng). Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Significant differences in the data between groups were tested by one-way analysis of variance with a post hoc test. Bars bearing different letters indicate significant differences (P < 0.05).Cyp19a1a F0 mutant fish were obtained as reported previously (29). F1 mutant fish were obtained by crossing F0 XX males with sex-reversed wild-type XY females. Heterozygous cyp19a1a F1 offspring with a 7-bp deletion in the first exon were selected to breed the F2 generation. This frame-shift mutation resulted in the premature termination of Cyp19a1a translation before the P450 superfamily conserved domain (Supplemental Fig. 9). A heteroduplex mobility assay identified the heterozygous cyp19a1a+/− individuals as those possessing both heteroduplex and homoduplex amplicons vs the cyp19a1a+/+ and cyp19a1a−/− individuals with only homoduplex amplicons (Supplemental Fig. 10). The sex of F2 fish was determined by genotyping with a sex-linked DNA marker (Supplemental Fig. 10). Histological analyses revealed that all cyp19a1a+/− XX and cyp19a1a+/+ XX fish developed as females, whereas all cyp19a1a−/− XX and cyp19a1a−/− XY fish developed as males [Fig. 5(g)]. Significantly lower levels of serum E2 were found in the control XY and cyp19a1a−/− XX fish compared with the control XX and cyp19a1a+/− XX fish [Fig. 5(a)]. Western blot analyses showed that the expression of Sf1, Dmrt1, Gsdf, and Cyp11b2 was upregulated in cyp19a1a−/− XX gonads. Expression of these genes was similar to that in the control XY fish, and distinct from their expression in the control XX and cyp19a1a+/- XX gonads [Fig. 5(b) and 5(c); Supplemental Fig. 11]. qRT-PCR showed that the expression of β-cat1, β-cat2, and figla was downregulated in the cyp19a1a−/− XX gonads, similar to the control XY, and distinct from the levels of expression in the cyp19a1a+/− XX and control XX gonads at 90 dah [Fig. 5(d-f)]. Ontogenetic analyses revealed that Dmrt1 was expressed in the cyp19a1a−/− XX and control XY gonads but not in the cyp19a1a+/− XX and control XX gonads at 5, 30, and 90 dah by IHC [Fig. 5(g)]. No significant differences in fertilization rate were observed between the cyp19a1a−/− XX male and the control XY male fish when mated with the normal XX females (Supplemental Fig. 5).Homozygous mutation cyp19a1a resulted in female-to-male sex reversal in XX tilapia. The serum E2 level was significantly lower in the cyp19a1a−/− XX and cyp19a1a+/+ XY fish than in the cyp19a1a+/− and cyp19a1a+/+ XX fish at 90 dah. (b, c) Western blot analyses revealed that Sf1, Dmrt1, Gsdf, and Cyp11b2 were highly expressed in the cyp19a1a−/− XX and cyp19a1a+/+ XY gonads, whereas Sf1 and Gsdf were weakly expressed and Dmrt1 and Cyp11b2 were not expressed in the cyp19a1a+/− and cyp19a1a+/+ XX gonads at 90 dah. (d–f) qRT-PCR revealed that the expression of β-cat1, β-cat2, and figla was significantly lower in the cyp19a1a−/− XX and cyp19a1a+/+ XY gonads than in the cyp19a1a+/− and cyp19a1a+/+ XX gonads at 90 dah. (g) When examined at 90 dah, the cyp19a1a+/+ XX (K) and cyp19a1a+/+ XY (L) gonad developed as ovary and testis, respectively, whereas the cyp19a1a−/− XX (I) gonad developed as testis and the cyp19a1a+/− XX (J) gonad developed as ovary. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that Dmrt1 was expressed in the cyp19a1a−/− XX (A, E, and I) and cyp19a1a+/+ XY (D, H, and L) gonads but not in the cyp19a1a+/− (B, F, and J) and cyp19a1a+/+ (C, G, and K) XX gonads at 5, 30, and 90 dah. Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Significant differences in the data between groups were tested by one-way analysis of variance with a post hoc test. Bars bearing different letters indicate significant differences (P < 0.05).There were fewer Vasa-positive germ cells in the foxl2−/−, cyp19a1a−/− XX and control XY gonads than in the control XX gonads [Fig. 6(a) and 6(b)]. qRT-PCR showed that vasa expression was much lower in the foxl2−/−, cyp19a1a−/− XX and control XY gonads than the control XX gonads [Fig. 6(c)].Fewer germ cells were observed in foxl2 and cyp19a1a XX homozygous mutant gonads compared with the control XX gonads. (a) The gonads of the foxl2−/− XX, cyp19a1a−/− XX, control XX and XY fish are encircled by the dotted line. (b) The number of germ cells (Vasa-positive cells) was significantly lower in the foxl2−/−, cyp19a1a−/− XX and control XY gonads than those of the control XX gonad at 10 dah. (c) qRT-PCR revealed that the expression of vasa was significantly lower in the foxl2−/−, cyp19a1a−/− XX, and control XY gonads than that in the control XX gonad at 10 dah. Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Significant differences in the data between groups were tested by one-way analysis of variance with a post hoc test. Bars bearing different letters indicate significant differences (P < 0.05).The evolutionarily conserved family of Fox genes is involved in many developmental processes, including sex determination and sexual differentiation. Our previous studies of Foxl2 in Nile tilapia provided important clues to its function in females, which were consistent with the generally accepted concept that Foxl2 plays a major role in ovarian differentiation (15, 25, 29). By mutating the foxl2 gene in tilapia, we provide, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive and conclusive genetic evidence so far in any nonmammalian species for the role of Foxl2 in female sex determination. A complementary study describing the knockout of zebrafish Foxl2a and Foxl2b was published while this manuscript was under revision (32).The gonads of foxl2−/− XX fish developed as testis, suggesting that loss of Foxl2 in XX tilapia resulted in female-to-male sex reversal. Sex reversal was confirmed by the observation that male-dominant genes (i.e., Sf1, Dmrt1, and Gsdf) were upregulated and female-dominant genes (i.e., figla, β-cat1, and β-cat2) were downregulated in the foxl2−/− XX fish. This is similar to the situation observed in the Foxl2 knockdown XX tilapia (29), Foxl2−/− XX goat (5), and homozygous foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/− double-mutant zebrafish (32), whose gonads all developed as testes. Furthermore, the sperm produced by the sex-reversed males were capable of fertilizing the eggs from wild-type females and showed no substantial difference in fertilization rate compared with wild-type males.It is well documented that Sf1 is essential for gonadal development and sexual determination or differentiation (50, 51). Our 2016 study demonstrated the negative regulation of Sf-1 expression by Foxl2 in gonads (40), which agrees with the reports in mouse (52, 53). Therefore, upregulation of Sf1 in foxl2−/− XX gonads could be explained as released suppression of sf1 transcription due to loss of Foxl2. Dmrt1 is an important transcription factor implicated in early testicular differentiation in vertebrates and is specifically expressed in Sertoli cells of the testis. It is well accepted that Foxl2 and Dmrt1 play antagonistic roles in sex differentiation, at least in mammal (54–57) and fish (29, 37, 58). As expected, similar to Sf1 expression, Dmrt1 was observed in the foxl2−/− XX gonads due to the loss of Foxl2. The same phenomenon was also observed in mouse gonads after Foxl2 ablation (54). Gsdf, a gene downstream of dmrt1 in the male pathway, is required for testicular differentiation in Nile tilapia (58). Moreover, in vitro promoter analyses demonstrate that Dmrt1 activates gsdf expression in the presence of Sf1, suggesting a synergism between Dmrt1 and Sf1 in activating gsdf transcription (58). Altogether, available data suggest that in the foxl2−/− XX gonads, the expression of Dmrt1 and Sf1 enhanced the subsequent expression of Gsdf, which is reported to be sufficient to induce the male sex differentiation pathway in the XX gonads of tilapia and lead to testis fate (59).Estrogens are necessary for promoting ovarian development and maintaining the female phenotype (60, 61). Aromatase (Cyp19A1) is the key enzyme for estrogen biosynthesis in vertebrates (62). Due to the teleost-specific whole-genome duplication, bony fish have two genes encoding aromatase, cyp19a1a and cyp19a1b. In mammals, Cyp19a1 is expressed in both the ovary and the brain, whereas, in tilapia, the expression of cyp19a1a appears to be restricted to the ovary, and cyp19a1b is most highly expressed in the brain (63). Therefore, cyp19a1a is likely the key gene that regulates tilapia female sexual development. Foxl2−/− XX gonads failed to express Cyp19a1a from 5 dah, resulting in a failure of estrogen synthesis. Foxl2 upregulates cyp19a1a gene expression by direct binding to the promoter (25). Moreover, the sex reversal caused by foxl2 mutation could be rescued by E2 treatment. Based on these data, we concluded that estrogen deficiency in foxl2 homozygous mutants was responsible for the sex reversal. The absence of Cyp19a1a expression and the presence of Dmrt1 expression in the foxl2 mutant gonad at 5 dah, the critical time for molecular sex determination in tilapia, suggest that the foxl2−/− XX fish shifted directly to the male pathway without any female differentiation.In teleosts, 11-KT, recognized as one of the major androgens, can regulate male spermatogenesis (64, 65). Cyp11b2 is the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of 11-KT (66). The elevated Cyp11b2 expression and serum 11-KT level in the foxl2−/− XX gonads promoted testicular development and spermatogenesis, and subsequently maintained the fertility of the sex-reversed fish. Star1, which is responsible for transportation of cholesterol to the inner membranes of mitochondria for conversion to other downstream steroid hormones, controls the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis (67, 68). Given that Star1 has previously been considered to play a critical role in promoting androgen production (43), we attempted to relate the star1 expression to the transcription factor Foxl2 using in vitro promoter analyses. Intriguingly, like human FOXL2 (68), tilapia Foxl2 activated star1 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Star1 was consistently expressed in the foxl2 mutant gonad at 30 and 90 dah, similar to the wild-type testis, as reported previously (43). Thus, we conclude that one function of Foxl2 is to repress Star1 expression in the ovary. Loss of Foxl2 led to Star1-dependent androgen production, which, in turn, promoted testicular development and spermatogenesis in the sex-reversed gonad.As expected, low levels of E2 (similar to that of the wild-type male) and female-to-male sex reversal were observed in the XX homozygous cyp19a1a mutants. These results are consistent with recent reports in zebrafish (31, 32). Sex reversal was confirmed by observation of an upregulation of male-dominant genes (Sf1, Dmrt1, Gsdf, and Cyp11b2) and a downregulation of female-dominant genes (figla, β-cat1, and β-cat2). The in vitro analysis revealed that tilapia Dmrt1 repressed basal as well as Sf1-activated cyp19a1a transcription. Moreover, transgenic overexpression of Dmrt1 in XX tilapia resulted in decreased Cyp19a1a expression, decreased E2 levels, and eventually led to sex reversal (66). In contrast, knockdown of Dmrt1 in mosaic F0 tilapia resulted in increased Cyp19a1a expression and E2 levels (29). Inhibition of endogenous estrogen synthesis using an aromatase inhibitor has been shown to induce masculinization in fishes (69–73), amphibians (74), reptiles (75), and birds (76). Like the foxl2 homozygous mutants, the cyp19a1a−/− XX tilapia shifted to the male pathway at as early as 5 dah, as reflected by the gonadal expression of Dmrt1. Furthermore, like foxl2−/− XX and the wild-type XY males, the cyp19a1a−/− XX males were fertile. Our results further demonstrate that Cyp19a1a and estrogens are critical for female sex determination in nonmammalian vertebrates.The number of germ cells is one of the key factors involved in fish sex determination (77). In tilapia, germ cell numbers showed no significantly change in either sex from 5 to 8 dah. However, the germ cell number increased significantly after 8 dah in XX female gonads, whereas it remained unchanged from 9 to 14 dah in XY male gonads (78). The number of germ cells in the foxl2−/− XX and cyp19a1a−/− XX fish was similar to that of the XY fish at 10 dah, indicating that germ cell proliferation was suppressed and affected the sexual fate of the homozygous mutants. Given that Cyp19a1a is expressed in XX gonads around 5 dah, and that estrogens play a key role in sex determination in tilapia, we speculated that estrogens might regulate germ cell proliferation. Estrogen deficiency may be responsible for the lower number of germ cells in the XY fish and the homozygous mutants.There are reports showing that the sexual phenotype is influenced by the epigenetic status (hypermethylation) of cyp19a1a (79, 80). There is also a report showing transmission of the epigenetic status of pseudomale tongue sole to the next generation, which resulted in more males (81). In the current study, the mutant lines of foxl2 and cyp19a1a were generated using a sex-reversal approach that exposes XY fish to high concentrations of E2 to feminize them. There may be other radical changes to the epigenetic status of these animals that are passed along to the F2 generation as a result of this manipulation. However, crossing E2-induced XY female mutant fish with wild-type XX males produced equal numbers of males and females in F1 progenies, and crossing of XX and XY F1 siblings resulted in equal numbers of males and females in F2 progenies, as expected. Similarly, in tilapia, crossing an XX pseudomale (induced by Fadrozole treatment) with a wild-type XX female produces all-female progenies (29, 40). Therefore, it seems that epigenetic modifications are not passed to the next generation in tilapia.In summary, we established foxl2 and cyp19a1a mutant lines in Nile tilapia. Foxl2−/− and cyp19a1a−/− XX fish displayed female-to-male sex reversal. The foxl2 mutant phenotype could be rescued by E2 treatment. Our results demonstrated that Foxl2 promotes ovarian development by upregulating Cyp19a1a expression, increasing germ cell number, and repressing male pathway gene expression (Fig. 7). To our knowledge, this is the first report of a loss function study of Foxl2 and Cyp19a1a in a commercially important fish.Schematic representation of the role of Foxl2 on male pathway genes, steroidogenesis, germ cell number, and gonadal phenotype in tilapia.

In zebrafish, ovarian differentiation appears to be dictated by an oocyte-derived signal via Cyp19a1a aromatase-mediated estrogen production. Androgens and aromatase inhibitors can induce female-to-male sex reversal, however, the mechanisms underlying gonadal masculinisation are poorly understood. We used histological analyses together with RNA sequencing to characterise zebrafish gonadal transcriptomes and investigate the effects of 17α-methyltestosterone on gonadal differentiation.At a morphological level, 17α-methyltestosterone (MT) masculinised gonads and accelerated spermatogenesis, and these changes were paralleled in masculinisation and de-feminisation of gonadal transcriptomes. MT treatment upregulated expression of genes involved in male sex determination and differentiation (amh, dmrt1, gsdf and wt1a) and those involved in 11-oxygenated androgen production (cyp11c1 and hsd11b2). It also repressed expression of ovarian development and folliculogenesis genes (bmp15, gdf9, figla, zp2.1 and zp3b). Furthermore, MT treatment altered epigenetic modification of histones in zebrafish gonads. Contrary to expectations, higher levels of cyp19a1a or foxl2 expression in control ovaries compared to MT-treated testes and control testes were not statistically significant during early gonad development (40 dpf).Our study suggests that both androgen production and aromatase inhibition are important for androgen-induced gonadal masculinisation and natural testicular differentiation in zebrafish.Natural and synthetic steroid hormones influence gonadal sex differentiation and sex ratios in teleost fish [1,2,3,4,5]. In particular, androgens regulate testicular development, spermatogenesis, male secondary sex characteristics, sexual behaviour and maintenance of male sexual phenotype in teleosts [4, 6,7,8,9]. The major natural androgen in teleost fish is 11-ketotestosterone [4], which is converted from androstenedione and testosterone via the steroidogenic enzymes 11β-hydroxylase (Cyp11c1) and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Hsd11b2) [10,11,12,13]. The effects of these androgens are mediated by androgen receptors [10, 14].Synthetic androgens are structural mimics of the native androgen receptor ligands testosterone and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT). They include 17α-methyltestosterone (MT), 17α-methyldihydrotestosterone, 17β-trenbolone, mibolerone and mesterolone [15]. Treatment with exogenous androgens at the labile stage during early development triggers testicular development, stimulates precocious spermatogenesis along with phenotypic and behavioural masculinisation, skews sex ratios towards males in gonochoristic fish [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24] and accelerates female-to-male sex change in protogynous hermaphroditic fish [25,26,27,28,29]. Studies suggest that androgen-induced female-to-male phenotypic sex reversal is functional and persistent [30,31,32,33]. Androgen induction of female-to-male sex reversal [15, 34] is routinely used for sex control in aquaculture [35], with MT being the most frequently used androgen for production of all-male populations in commercial settings [15] because of its high masculinising potency [15].Two hypotheses exist for the mode of action of androgens for induction of testicular differentiation: (1) indirect, via aromatase inhibition which reduces estrogen production [36,37,38] and (2) direct, via interactions with androgen receptor [36]. Prior studies of androgen-induced gonadal masculinisation in European seabass [39], Japanese flounder [19], groupers [26, 29], Nile tilapia [40] and rainbow trout [41,42,43,44,45] using candidate gene and microarray approaches [46] support the aromatase inhibition hypothesis. The gonadal masculinisation observed in zebrafish following treatment with aromatase inhibitor also strongly supports this hypothesis [38]. However, recent studies in tilapia and grouper implicate androgen receptor in androgen-induced phenotypic masculinisation [36, 47]. Overall, the molecular mechanisms underpinning androgen-induced gonadal masculinisation in fishes remain to be clarified.Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a popular toxicological model and has been used extensively to study the effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals on gonad development and sexual phenotype [24, 30,31,32, 48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57]. The primary sex determining region present in wild zebrafish strains appear to have largely been lost in laboratory strains through the domestication process [58]. Almost all zebrafish in the world are derived from domesticated strains, with most from the AB strain and its derivatives except for the WIK strain. Domesticated zebrafish use a polygenic sex determination system [59] vulnerable to the effects of high temperature [60, 61], hypoxia [62], rearing density [63, 64], inbreeding, out-crossing [65, 66] and hormones [30]. Zebrafish is a juvenile hermaphrodite, wherein all individuals initially develop a non-functional ‘juvenile ovary’ [67,68,69,70]. Oocytes undergo apoptosis in juvenile ovaries of presumptive males during juvenile ovary-to-testis gonadal transformation [71]. In contrast, oocytes continue oogenesis and oocyte maturation in presumptive females [68] via unknown ovarian aromatase (Cyp19a1a)-mediated mechanisms [70]. Depending on the dosage, treatment with exogenous androgens can induce female-to-male sex reversal [24, 30,31,32,33] and paradoxical feminisation in zebrafish [72]. The Tg(vas:egfp) zebrafish line exhibits sexually dimorphic expression of green fluorescent protein which facilitates in vivo sex identification during early gonad development [73]. It has been used to study estrogenic effects in zebrafish [74].Little is known about the direct transcriptional effects of MT during gonad masculinisation. In this study, we treated juvenile Tg(vas:egfp) transgenic zebrafish with 100 ng/L MT from 20 days post fertilisation (dpf) to 40 dpf and 60 dpf. These time points were selected to reflect the onset (20 dpf) and completion (40 dpf) of juvenile ovary-to-testis transformation as well as the onset of female puberty (60 dpf) in zebrafish [68, 69, 75]. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to profile global gene expression patterns in MT-treated gonads. The gonadal transcriptomes of MT-treated zebrafish were compared with those of control zebrafish testes and ovaries to provide insights into the molecular basis for MT-induced gonadal masculinisation in zebrafish.This study was approved by the University of Otago Animal Ethics Committee (AEC No. 101/09). All experiments were performed in accordance with the Good Practice Guide for the use of animals in research, testing and teaching.Zebrafish were maintained according to Westerfield [76]. We used larval and juvenile transgenic zebrafish expressing an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the vasa promoter, Tg(vas:egfp), derived from the domesticated Tübingen/AB strains [73]. EGFP expression in Tg(vas:egfp) transgenic zebrafish enables visualisation and isolation of gonads before the gonads can be unequivocally distinguished from other tissues [77]. Higher levels of fluorescence are detected in ovaries than testes [69, 73], which can be used to distinguish the phenotypic sex of the fish.17α-methyltestosterone (MT) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich Sweden AB, Stockholm, Sweden) and dissolved in 100% ethanol to prepare stock solutions of 50 mg/L. At 18 to 19 dpf, juvenile zebrafish were transferred from 4 L tanks into petri dishes where they were size-sorted by visual inspection. Zebrafish that were unusually small (<5.5 mm) or large (>8.5 mm) were removed. The remaining juvenile zebrafish (between 5.5 to 8.5 mm in length) were transferred into 4 L tanks containing 3.5 L of system water at a density of 20 individuals per tank.For the MT exposure, the juvenile zebrafish were exposed to system water containing either 100 ng/L of MT dissolved in 0.0001% ethanol (100 ng/L MT) or 0.0001% ethanol alone (solvent control). Each exposure group consisted of 3 biological replicates comprising 20 juvenile zebrafish each. The exposure was performed continuously under a semi-static system for 20 or 40 days extending from 20 dpf to 40 dpf or 60 dpf. Water with equivalent concentrations of MT and ethanol was used to replace half of the water in each beaker every second day for the MT treatment and solvent control groups respectively.At the termination of the treatment at 40 dpf and 60 dpf, the juvenile zebrafish were sacrificed via snap chilling in ice water. EGFP expression of each zebrafish was observed under a Leica M205 FA fluorescence dissecting stereo microscope (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, Illinois, USA) to determine the gonadal sex of each fish and sex ratios for each exposure group. Between 18 to 24 fish per exposure group (comprising 6 to 8 fish from each of the 3 replicates per time point) were selected for histological analysis to confirm gonadal sex as determined by EGFP expression and to determine the developmental stages of each gonad. Whole zebrafish were fixed overnight in 10% neutral buffered formalin, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Haematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were examined under light microscopy to determine gonadal sex. Ovaries were classified as Stage I or Stage II [75], based on the absence or presence of Stage II oocytes containing cortical alveoli, respectively [78]. Testes were categorised into transition gonads, immature testes or mature testes. Gonads with basophilic apoptotic bodies and infiltration of stromal tissue were classified as transition gonads [68]. Testes were classified as immature or mature depending on the absence or presence of spermatozoa [79]. Spermatids differentiate into spermatozoa, through a series of morphological changes inclusive of nuclear compaction and flagellum formation, which are released into the seminiferous tubule lumen at the end of spermiogenesis [80].The juvenile zebrafish gonads were dissected and placed into aliquots of RNAlater (Invitrogen, ﻿﻿Life Technologies GmbH / ThermoFisher Scientific﻿﻿, Darmstadt, Germany) or Lysis buffer (RLT buffer from an RNeasy Mini kit, Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany or RA1 lysis buffer from a Nucleospin RNA II kit, Macherey-Nagel ﻿﻿﻿﻿GmbH & Co. KG﻿﻿, Düren﻿﻿, Germany) and stored at −80 °C for subsequent RNA isolation. The gonads from ten individuals per exposure group were pooled together for RNA extraction. Gonads were homogenized by passing through a 20 gauge needle or using 2 cycles of the TissueLyser II system (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) set at 20 Hz for 1 min per cycle.RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) or a Nucleospin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel ﻿﻿GmbH & Co. KG﻿﻿, Düren, Germany) and eluted in 53ul of RNase-free water.Three biological replicates of gonad pools consisting of 10 individuals each were generated for each exposure group (MT exposure and solvent control), sex (male or female) and time point (40 dpf or 60 dpf) (Fig. 1). The RNA samples were quantified and integrity was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, California, USA). RNA samples with RNA Integrity Numbers (RIN) ≥7.0 (majority with RIN ≥ 8.0 to 9.0) were used for RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq).General overview schematic of the zebrafish gonad RNA-Seq experiment. RNA was isolated from pools of gonads dissected from 10 individuals and subjected to RNA-Seq analyses. The gonads were pooled according to sex (male, female and masculinised male), developmental period tested (40 dpf and 60 dpf) and treatment group (solvent control and 17α-methyltestosterone treatment). Gonad RNA pools were analysed in triplicateThe Illumina TruSeq RNA sample preparation kit v2 (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California, USA) was used with 1 μg of starting total RNA from the gonad pools to generate 100 bp paired end (PE) cDNA libraries in accordance to the manufacturer’s instructions. Three biological replicates were generated for each exposure group except for the 40 dpf MT-treated testis group, which was limited to two biological replicates. A total of seventeen gonad tagged cDNA libraries were sequenced: 40CO1–3 (40 dpf control ovary pools 1 to 3), 40CT1–3 (40 dpf control testis pools 1 to 3), 40MT1–2 (40 dpf MT-treated testis pools 1 and 2), 60CO1–3 (60 dpf control ovary pools 1 to 3), 60CT1–3 (60 dpf control testis pools 1 to 3), and 60MT1–3 (60 dpf MT-treated testis pools 1 to 3), on a HiSeq 2000 sequencer (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California, USA) at the New Zealand Genomics Limited Otago facility (Otago Genomics and Bioinformatics Facility, University of Otago, Dunedin,﻿ Otago, New Zealand) (Table 1). The raw sequencing reads have been submitted to NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) repository under accession number SRP102493.The quality of the raw reads was assessed using the FastQC software [81] and the sequencing QC report tool in CLC Genomics Workbench 6.0.2 software (Qiagen Bioinformatics GmbH, Hilden, Germany). CLC Genomics Workbench was used to trim low quality sequences (phred-based error probability threshold of 0.05) and to remove TruSeq adapter sequences from the raw reads. Trimmed reads from each pool were mapped and aligned to the Zebrafish Zv9 reference sequence (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current_fasta/danio_rerio/dna/) from the ENSEMBL database. Annotation of the Zebrafish ZV9 reference genome was performed using the respective GTF file (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current_gtf/danio_rerio/) using the CLC Genomics Workbench 6.0.2 ‘Annotate with GFF/GTF’ plug-in. In order to correct for differences in transcript length and library size, transcript abundance was normalised using the reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) method [82]. Transcripts with RPKM value greater than or equal to 1.0 (RPKM ≥1.0) were regarded as expressed. Transcripts with RPKM value greater than or equal to 5.0 (RPKM ≥5.0) were regarded as reliably expressed.Differentially expressed transcripts were identified in the zebrafish gonad transcriptomes across different conditions (sex, age, MT treatment and gonad phenotype) using the proportions-based beta-binomial Baggerley’s test [83]. The RPKM data was transformed by adding a constant (1.0) and then normalised using a quantile normalisation. Transcripts responsive to MT were identified via pairwise comparisons of MT-treated gonads with age-matched control ovaries and testes. Transcripts were regarded as differentially expressed if they complied with (1) the normalised fold change threshold of greater than or equal to two for upregulated transcripts and smaller than or equal to minus two for downregulated transcripts (≥ 2.0-fold) and (2) a false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p-value of ≤0.05 (p ≤ 0.05) [84].To investigate the overall gene expression patterns across the treatment conditions and phenotypic sexes, we performed hierarchical clustering using Pearson correlation distance with complete linkage, and Principal Component Analyses (PCA), as implemented and visualised in CLC Genomics Workbench. The sets of differentially expressed transcripts that overlapped or differed between treatments were visualised using Venn diagrams plotted using the Venny software (http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/).Gene Ontology Consortium (GO) [85] functional annotation terms and categories were assigned to the differentially expressed genes with the ‘Add Annotations’ tool of CLC Genomics Workbench. The GO terms, IDs and annotations were downloaded from the Gene Ontology database in the 20 May 2013 release of the ZFIN Zebrafish GO gene association file (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.downloads.annotations.shtml).Biological functions and metabolic pathways significantly overrepresented among the differentially expressed genes were identified using Metacore (GeneGo, Thomson Reuters, Carlsbad, California, USA). This approach utilizes Fisher’s exact test with an FDR correction for multiple testing. Differentially expressed genes were defined as genes where (1) the absolute value for normalised fold change was greater than or equal to two and (2) the FDR adjusted p-value was less than 0.05 [84].Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted on 12 differentially expressed transcripts identified from the RNA-seq data. TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) specific to our genes of interest were used with a Stratagene Mx3000P (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA) Real Time-PCR thermal cycler. Each qPCR reaction was performed in triplicate. β-actin 1, ribosomal protein L13 alpha (rpl13α) and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1, like 1 (eef1a1l1) were tested for their utility as the reference genes for this study. Previous studies have shown that the expression levels of these genes remain fairly constant across different developmental periods, treatment conditions, sexes and tissue types in zebrafish [86, 87]. In this study, minor differences in β-actin 1 expression were found between different pooled ovary samples however the expression levels of rpl13α and eef1a1l1 were consistent across different tissue types (adult testes and ovaries) as previously reported [88] (data not shown). eef1a1l1 gave the highest average expression stability values with the geNorm algorithm [89].The comparative CT method (ΔΔCt) was used to determine relative gene expression compared to the reference gene eef1a1l1. The female ovary groups (40CO and 60CO) were used as the calibrator for calculation of relative expression. Relative expression was expressed as fold change (Fold Change = 2 − ΔΔCt). Complete details of the genes selected, TaqMan Gene Expression Assays and qPCR cycling conditions are provided in Additional file 1.Sex ratios were determined via visualisation of EGFP fluorescence intensity of Tg(vas:egfp) zebrafish under a fluorescence microscope. Gonads exhibiting low and high EGFP fluorescence were classified as testes and ovaries respectively [69, 73]. Male and female zebrafish were present in the control at 40 dpf and 60 dpf. The control sex ratios were 32% males at 40 dpf and 45% males at 60 dpf (Additional file 2). The mortality rates were very low (≤10%) for the control with no significant difference (p-value > 0.05) observed between replicates (Additional file 2).To determine the effects of MT on zebrafish gonad development, we treated juvenile zebrafish with 100 ng/L MT from 20 dpf to 40 dpf and 60 dpf. All MT-treated zebrafish had testes except for one individual at 40 dpf (40 dpf: 59/60 individuals and 60 dpf: 98/98 individuals) (Additional file 2) suggesting that MT treatment had stimulated gonadal masculinisation.The EGFP fluorescence signal was considerably fainter in 40 dpf testes than for 40 dpf ovaries. A few gonads (4/4 males) appeared to be undergoing gonadal transformation into testes at 40 dpf and were classified as presumptive testes (Fig. 2a). Several residual bodies indicative of apoptotic oocytes were present. The remaining oocytes in these gonads had lost their tight contact and showed signs of degeneration including shrinkage, irregularity of shape and basophilic cytoplasm. Stromal tissue had infiltrated the inter-oocyte spaces. In a few individuals, the germ cells had re-arranged to form tubule-like structures.Histological analysis of gonads of 40 dpf control (a and b) and MT-treated juvenile zebrafish (c-f). a Presumptive testis characterised by the presence of residual bodies (RB), an indicator of oocyte degeneration, infiltration of stromal (Str) cells and spermatogenic tubule-like structures (→). b Ovary with Stage IA (IA) and Stage IB (IB) oocytes. c Transforming gonad. d Immature testis with spermatogonia (Sg), spermatocytes (Sc) and spermatids (St). e Mature testis possessing spermatogonia (Sg), spermatocytes (Sc), spermatids (St) and spermatozoa (Sz). f Ovary with Stage IA (IA) and Stage IB (IB) oocytes. Bar = 100 μmRegardless of the stage of ovarian development, intense EGFP fluorescence signals were detected in ovaries of 40 dpf and 60 dpf zebrafish. At 40 dpf, all control females analysed using histological examination possessed ovaries at early stages of development (14 /14 individuals). These immature ovaries were predominantly filled with tightly packed Stage IB oocytes although pre-meiotic Stage IA oogonia were located at the caudal edges of the ovaries (Fig. 2b). Most MT-treated zebrafish had mature testes at 40 dpf (17/22 individuals) (Fig. 2e). One was undergoing juvenile ovary-to-testis transformation (Fig. 2c). The remaining three individuals possessed immature testes (Fig. 2d). In contrast, control males had testes which had just completed juvenile ovary-to-testis transformation (4/4 individuals) (Fig. 2a).Similar to 40 dpf control ovaries, the 40 dpf MT-treated ovary contained Stage IB oocytes (Fig. 2f). Early range-finding experiments testing different periods of MT exposure suggested that occasionally a few individuals exposed to MT from 20 dpf to 40 dpf or 50 dpf were refractory to the masculinising effects of MT treatment (data not shown).Testes at 60 dpf barely exhibited any EGFP fluorescence. There were three types of 60 dpf control testes: presumptive (2/10 males), immature (4/10 males) and mature testes (4/10 males) (Fig. 3a – c). 60 dpf presumptive testes resembled 40 dpf presumptive testes which were populated with a few degenerative oocytes and large volumes of stromal tissue (Fig. 3a). Most 60 dpf control testes (8/10 individuals) were at a more advanced stage of differentiation than those at 40 dpf (Fig. 3b and c). Well-differentiated spermatogonial cysts containing spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids were observed in 60 dpf control immature and mature testes (Fig. 3b and c). The lumens of mature 60 dpf control testes were filled with mature spermatozoa (Fig. 3c).Histological analysis of gonads of 60 dpf untreated control (a - f) and MT-treated juvenile zebrafish (g). a Presumptive testis comprising infiltration of stromal (Str) cells and spermatogenic tubule-like structures (→). b Immature testis containing spermatogonia (Sg), spermatocytes (Sc) and spermatids (St). c Mature testis containing spermatogonia (Sg), spermatocytes (Sc), spermatids (St) and spermatozoa (Sz). d Ovary with Stage IA (IA) and Stage IB (IB) oocytes. e Ovary with Stage I IA (IA), Stage IB (IB) and Stage II (II) oocytes. f Ovary with Stage I IA (IA), Stage IB (IB) and Stage II (II) oocytes. g Mature testis possessing spermatogonia (Sg), spermatocytes (Sc), spermatids (St) and spermatozoa (Sz). Bar = 100 μmConsiderable individual differences in the extent of ovarian development were seen in 60 dpf control females. A few ovaries (6/13 females) consisted primarily of Stage IB oocytes (Fig. 3d). Others (7/13 females) contained oocytes at more advanced stages of development such as Stage II cortical alveolar oocytes (Fig. 3e and f).Greater numbers of 60 dpf MT-treated zebrafish possessed mature testes (21/21 individuals) (Fig. 3g) than control males (17/22 individuals) whose testes were at various stages of spermatogenesis (Fig. 3a - c).To elucidate the genes involved in zebrafish sexual differentiation, we compared the transcriptomes of developing zebrafish testes and ovaries using RNA Sequencing. Gonads were classified as testes or ovaries on the basis of EGFP expression in the juvenile Tg(vas:egfp) zebrafish as described above. Greater numbers of gene transcripts were present in the zebrafish testis than zebrafish ovary at both 40 dpf and 60 dpf (Additional file 3). About 12,000 transcripts were consistently expressed (RPKM ≥ 5) in zebrafish testes (Table 2). In contrast, ~8000 transcripts were expressed in zebrafish ovaries at 40 dpf and 60 dpf (Table 2).Developing zebrafish testes and ovaries showed striking differences in the numbers of differentially expressed transcripts at 40 dpf and 60 dpf. At 40 dpf, over 5000 transcripts were differentially expressed (≥ 2-fold, FDR-adjusted p-value ≤0.05) between testes and ovaries (Fig. 4a and b). Of these, half were preferentially expressed in testes and half were expressed more highly in ovaries. Significantly greater numbers of sexually dimorphic transcripts were identified at 60 dpf than at 40 dpf. At 60 dpf, the number of sex differentially expressed transcripts had risen to almost 8500 (Fig. 4c and d). Similar to what was observed at 40 dpf, the proportion of testis-enriched transcripts and ovary-enriched transcripts were approximately the same at 60 dpf.Comparison of differentially expressed genes in MT-treated zebrafish testes with testis-enriched and ovary-enriched genes of control zebrafish ovaries and testes. n = 3 pools of 10 individuals each. a Venn diagram of numbers of genes which showed upregulated expression in 40 dpf MT-treated testes (40MT) overlapped with 40 dpf testes (40CT) and 40 dpf ovaries (40CO). b Venn diagram of numbers of genes which showed downregulated expression in 40 dpf MT-treated testes (40MT) overlapped with 40 dpf testes (40CT) and 40 dpf ovaries (40CO). c Venn diagram of numbers of genes which showed upregulated expression in 60 dpf MT- treated testes (40MT) overlapped with 60 dpf testes (60CT) and 60 dpf ovaries (60CO). d Venn diagram of numbers of genes which showed downregulated expression in 60 dpf MT-treated testes (40MT) overlapped with 60 dpf testes (60CT) and 60 dpf ovaries (60CO)Transcripts with pro-male roles in fishes (dmrt1, amh, gsdf and sox9a) and genes encoding steroidogenic enzymes for 11-oxygenated androgen production (cyp11c1, cyp17a1, hsd11b2, nr5a1a and star) and androgen receptivity (ar) were more highly expressed in control testes than control ovaries during gonadal transformation and testicular differentiation (Table 3, Additional file 4). We also found upregulation of genes involved in gamma-aminobutyric acid (gabrr2b and glsb) and dopamine (drd2l) signalling, immune response (il1b, mif and irf9) and encoding histone variants (h1f0, h1fx, h2afy2, histh1l and hist2h2l) in control testes (CT) compared to control ovaries (CO) (Table 3, Additional file 4). The gene names and IDs can be found in Additional file 5.There were developmental stage-specific differences in expression levels of testis-biased transcripts (Table 3). G ata4, pdgfra and tp53 expression in testes were significantly higher in testes than ovaries at 40 dpf (early testicular development) but not 60 dpf (Table 3, Additional file 4). The magnitude of testis-biased expression of several pro-male genes (dmrt1, gsdf, wt1a, nr0b1 and amh) was significantly higher at 40 dpf than 60 dpf (Table 3﻿, Additional file 4). Genes encoding sperm tail proteins septin3, septin8b and odf3b had been upregulated in testes compared to ovaries at 60 dpf but not 40 dpf (Table 3, Additional file 4, Additional file 6 ).Transcripts implicated in teleost fish female sex determination, ovarian development, oogenesis and folliculogenesis (foxl2, cyp19a1a, lhx8a, figla, bmp15, gdf9, zp21. and zp3b) were more highly expressed in control ovaries than control testes (Table 4, Additional file 4). The gene names and IDs can be found in Additional file 5.We observed stage-dependent differences in ovarian expression patterns. Genes involved in fish folliculogenesis (bmp15, figla, gdf9, lhx8a, zp2.1, zp3b and vldr) had been more highly expressed in ovaries than testes from 40 dpf (Table 4). However, the expression levels of several pro-female transcripts (foxl2, cyp19a1a, esr2a and vtg1) had only been significantly upregulated in ovaries compared to testes at 60 dpf (Table 4). We also found higher expression of several genes involved in histone modification and DNA methylation (ehmt1a, ehmt2 and dnmt1) and encoding histone variants (h2afx and h1m) in ovaries compared to testes (Table 4).The expression patterns of a few transcripts with established roles in female sex determination and sex differentiation (sox9b, ctnnb1, ctnnbip1, wnt4a and rspo1) were not identified as sexually dimorphic in this study (Additional file 4).Substantially fewer transcripts were differentially expressed between MT-treated testes and control testes in comparison with control ovaries, particularly at 60 dpf (Table 5). Although more than five thousand transcripts were differentially expressed in MT-treated gonads compared to control ovaries at 40 dpf (Table 5), only about a thousand differentially expressed transcripts separated the transcriptomes of MT-treated gonads from control testes transcriptomes (Table 5). The transcripts differentially expressed in 40 dpf MT-treated testes compared to control ovaries overlapped considerably with those differentially expressed between control testes and control ovaries (Fig. 4a and b).At 60 dpf, the number of transcripts differentially expressed in MT-treated testes relative to control ovaries rose to seven and a half thousand (Table 5). At the same time, the number of transcripts differentially expressed between the MT-treated gonads and control testes fell to 20 (Table 5).Marked changes indicating masculinisation and de-feminisation of the gonad transcriptome were observed in testes treated with MT to 40 dpf and 60 dpf. Among the two and a half thousand transcripts with upregulated expression in 40 dpf MT-treated testes relative to 40 dpf control ovaries (Table 5), 61% were more highly expressed in control testes than control ovaries i.e., testis-enriched (Fig. 4a). Many of these transcripts have established roles in vertebrate testicular development and spermatogenesis (Table 6, Additional file 7).Of nearly three thousand transcripts showing downregulated expression in 40 dpf MT-treated testes compared to 40 dpf control ovaries (Table 4), 74% were more highly expressed in control ovaries than control testes i.e., ovary-enriched (Fig. 4b). Genes previously implicated in fish folliculogenesis were included among the transcripts more highly expressed in ovaries compared to MT-treated testes (Table 7, Additional file 7). The proportions of transcripts with testis-enriched and ovary-enriched expression in 60 dpf MT-treated testes rose to 92% of the three and a half thousand upregulated transcripts (Fig. 4c and Table 5) and 87% of the four thousand downregulated transcripts (Fig. 4d and Table 5), respectively. This confirms that the correlation between the expression profiles of MT-treated gonads and control testes increased with developmental stage.The overlap between the testis-biased transcripts and transcripts showing upregulated expression in MT-treated testes relative to ovaries at 40 dpf was higher for 60 dpf control testes (96%) than 40 dpf control testes (61%) (Fig. 5a). A similar pattern was observed for the transcripts which exhibited downregulated expression in 40 dpf MT-treated testes. A greater proportion of transcripts exhibiting downregulated expression in 40 dpf MT-treated testes was shared with 60 dpf control testes (89%) than 40 dpf control testes (74%) (Fig. 5b). A comparison between the transcriptomes of 40 dpf MT-treated testes and 60 dpf control testes revealed a difference of just 136 differentially expressed transcripts (Additional file 8).Comparison of differentially expressed genes in MT-treated zebrafish testes with testis-enriched genes of 40 dpf and 60 dpf control testes. n = 3 pools of 10 individuals each with the exception of 40MT which comprised of 2 pools. a Venn diagram of numbers of genes which showed upregulated expression in 40 dpf MT-treated testes (40MT) overlapped with numbers of genes upregulated in 40 dpf testes (40CT) and 60 dpf testes (60CT). b Venn diagram of numbers of genes which showed downregulated expression in 40 dpf MT-treated testes (40MT) overlapped with numbers of genes downregulated in 40 dpf testes (40CT) and 60 dpf testes (60CT). c Venn diagram of numbers of genes which showed upregulated expression in 60 dpf MT-treated testes (60MT) overlapped with numbers of genes upregulated in 40 dpf testes (40CT) and 60 dpf testes (60CT). d Venn diagram of numbers of genes which showed downregulated expression in 60 dpf MT-treated testes (60MT) overlapped with numbers of genes downregulated in 40 dpf testes (40CT) and 60 dpf testes (60CT)The pattern continued at 60 dpf where 92% of transcripts exhibiting upregulated expression in 60 dpf MT-treated testes overlapped with 60 dpf testis-biased transcripts compared to 55% for 40 dpf testis-biased transcripts (Fig. 5c). 87% of transcripts with downregulated expression in 60 dpf MT-treated testes compared to 60 dpf control ovaries was shared with 60 dpf control testis as compared to 56% for 40 dpf control testis (Fig. 5d).The minor differences in the genetic cascades of 40 dpf MT-treated testes and 60 dpf control testes concurs with the gonad histological data which suggested that 17α-methyltestosterone had accelerated testicular development (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3).The pathways enriched with genes exhibiting sexually dimorphic expression in zebrafish testes and ovaries were markedly different (Additional file 9). Similarly, the pathways overrepresented in MT-treated testes were considerably different from those in ovaries (Additional file 9). There was, however, substantial overlap between the pathways overrepresented in testes and MT-masculinized gonads, particularly at 60 dpf (Additional file 9).‘Cell cycle’, ‘reproduction - progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation’ and ‘transcription’ pathways were highly enriched in zebrafish ovaries during early ovarian development (40 dpf) (Additional file 9). Zebrafish testes showed an enrichment of genes involved in ‘cytoskeleton remodelling’, and ‘immune response’, 'TGFβ signalling' and 'G-protein signalling' pathways at 40 dpf (Additional file 9).Genes related to ‘cell cycle’, ‘reproduction - progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation’, ‘development-WNT signalling pathway’ and ‘protein folding and maturation_Angiotensin system maturation’ pathways were highly overrepresented in 60 dpf ovaries (Additional file 9). A significant overrepresentation of genes required for ‘cytoskeleton remodelling’ and ‘G-protein signalling’ were observed in 60 dpf testes (Additional file 9).While 40 dpf zebrafish ovaries were highly enriched in genes for ‘cell cycle’, ‘development’ and ‘transcription’ pathways, MT-treated testes were enriched in genes involved in ‘immune response’, ‘cytoskeleton remodelling’ and different ‘cell cycle’ pathways (Additional file 9).At 60 dpf, canonical 'Wnt signalling', 'integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration', 'progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation' pathways were highly overrepresented in ovaries (Additional file 9). 60 dpf MT-treated testes were significantly enriched in ‘oxidative phosphorylation’, ‘immune response’ and ‘cell cycle’ pathways (Additional file 9).Mitotic ‘cell cycle’ and nucleotide metabolism pathways were overrepresented in 40 dpf MT-treated testes (Additional file 9). In contrast, there was significant overrepresentation of pathways involved in ﻿'apoptosis' , Brca1 mediated regulation of transcription, the synthesis of cortisone, cortisol and androgen signalling in 40 dpf control testes (Additional file 9).Although 60 dpf testes were highly enriched in ﻿'DNA replication', ﻿'relaxin signalling', nucleotide metabolism and ﻿'fatty acid biosynthesis' pathways (Additional file 9), no pathways were overrepresented in 60 dpf MT-treated testes.To validate the RNA-Seq results, qPCR was conducted on 12 differentially expressed genes from four pairwise comparisons based on sex and treatment: 40CT vs. 40CO, 40MT vs. 40CO, 60CT vs. 60CO and 60MT vs. 60CO (Additional file 10). The direction of fold-change for the two platforms agreed for most of the genes (10/12 genes tested) (Additional file 10) confirming the accuracy of the RNA-Seq data.In this study, we investigated the effects of MT treatment on zebrafish gonadal transcriptomes during gonadal differentiation. We found that MT treatment masculinises gonadal transcriptomes and is accompanied by morphological changes consistent with male gonad development. MT activated pro-male gene expression (dmrt1, amh and gsdf) and induced steroidogenic enzymes required for production of 11-oxygenated androgens (cyp11c1 and hsd11b2). MT treatment also repressed gonadal expression of pro-female genes cyp19a1a, foxl2, bmp15 and gdf9, particularly during folliculogenesis at 60 dpf. Taken together, our data suggest that MT-induced masculinisation involves both activation of androgen receptor-mediated pathways and inhibition of aromatase.We found strong upregulation of dmrt1 expression in both control and MT-treated testes in this study, consistent with its essential role in zebrafish testis development [90]. In tilapia, upregulation of dmrt1 expression is associated with androgen-induced gonadal masculinisation [91]. Similarly, dmrt1 expression increased following MT treatment of XX medaka [92], and upon temperature-dependent induction of gonadal masculinisation in European seabass [93], tilapia [94], medaka [95] and pejerrey [96]. We suggest that the activation of dmrt1 may be one of the key steps underpinning hormonal and environmental gonadal masculinisation in fish.MT treatment increased amh expression in zebrafish gonads. Amh operates downstream of dmrt1 in zebrafish [90] and is highly expressed in zebrafish transforming testes where it may inhibit cyp19a1a expression [13, 97]. Defective amh/amhr signalling in medaka causes excessive germ cell proliferation and male-to-female sex reversal in half of XY hotei mutants [98, 99]. The data are collectively consistent with the idea that amh signalling operates downstream of MT to repress female patterns of germ cell proliferation in teleosts.MT treatment upregulated gsdf gonadal expression in zebrafish, consistent with a recent study in medaka demonstrating that MT induced gsdf expression in gonads [92]. In medaka, gsdf is involved in early testicular differentiation and is a key regulator of male-specific gene expression [100,101,102,103]. Gsdf expression has not been characterised in zebrafish. Our results suggest gsdf may be important for zebrafish testicular differentiation.Interestingly, we found higher expression of gabrr2b and drd2l in control and MT-treated testes than control ovaries. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and dopamine are important regulatory neurotransmitters in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis. In teleost fish, both GABA and dopamine modulate production of hypothalamic gonadotrophin releasing hormone and pituitary gonadotrophins [104,105,106,107,108,109,110].GABA A receptor has been implicated in Leydig cell proliferation in mice [111, 112]. GABA may regulate androgen production in rodent testes [113,114,115]. Dopamine type 2 receptor has been reported in mammalian testes and male germ cells where it regulates sperm capacitation and motility [116, 117]. Although dopamine antagonists are used with gonadotrophin analogues (eg. Ovaprim) for induced spawning in aquaculture [118, 119], the role of dopamine signalling in fish spermatogenesis has not been studied. Our expression data suggests that GABAergic and dopamine signalling may be important for teleost testicular development.Genes encoding the cytokines mif and il1b had been upregulated in control and MT-testes compared to control ovaries. GO pathways involved in immune response pathways had been significantly upregulated in control testes and MT-treated testes compared to control ovaries. MIF-JAB1 and interleukin 1 signalling pathways were significantly over-represented in testes. MIF and IL-1β are cytokines involved in innate immunity and inflammation. Both act as paracrine factors responsible for regulation of testosterone production by Leydig cells in rat testes [120,121,122,123,124]. MIF is produced by Leydig cells and Sertoli cells where it is involved in the cross-talk between Leydig cells and testicular seminiferous tubule somatic cells, spermagonial cell migration and may be involved in regulation of sex hormone production and spermiogenesis [125,126,127,128]. IL-1β is expressed in mice testicular germ and somatic cells [129]. Interleukin 1 is important for Sertoli cell proliferation [130, 131]. Our data suggests that mif and il1b may mediate androgen-induced sex reversal in zebrafish.Unexpectedly, we found that a few irf genes which included irf9 were more highly expressed in control and MT-treated testes than control ovaries. A truncated form of irf9 was identified as the master sex determining gene in rainbow trout [132]. Our expression data supports Yano et al. 2014’s hypothesis that interferon signalling may be involved in teleost testicular development and spermatogenesis. It may be worthwhile to study possible roles of interferon in teleost testes.In this study, MT upregulated gene expression for several histone variants (h1f0, h1fx, h2afy2, histh1l and hist2h2l) compared to ovaries. Interestingly, gene expression of these histones had also been significantly upregulated during heat-induced masculinisation of zebrafish [61]. Testis-specific histone variants eg. histone HI variant H1t [133], histone H2B variant TSH2B [134, 135], histone H3 variant H3t [136, 137], histone H1 like [138] have been identified in mammals. Some of the testis-specific histone variants have been implicated in mammalian spermatogenesis [134, 136, 138, 139]. Chromatin compaction during spermiogenesis requires epigenetic modification of histones [139, 140], via mechanisms including chromatin modification via exchange of histone variants and histone modification [141].MT treatment caused strong inhibition of bmp15 expression in zebrafish gonads. Bmp15 is necessary for activation of cyp19a1a expression and therefore estrogen production in granulosa cells surrounding Stage II oocytes [142]. Loss of cyp19a1a expression in juvenile zebrafish ovaries leads to germ cell apoptosis and female-to-male sex reversal [70]. Our results suggest that MT treatment may suppress ovarian development by preventing bmp15-mediated cyp19a1a expression in granulosa cells. MT treatment also strongly inhibited genes involved in Wnt signalling pathways. Wnt signalling is important for ovarian differentiation in zebrafish [143], medaka [144, 145] and rainbow trout [146] so its repression is consistent with masculinisation.We found that MT downregulated expression of genes involved in chromatin histone modification and DNA methylation pathways in epigenetics (dnmt1, hdac11, ehmt1a and ehmt2) compared to control ovaries. Interestingly, hdac11 and ehmt2 expression had been upregulated with heat-induced masculinisation in European seabass [93]. The expression levels of the histone variants h2afx and h1m had been lower in MT-treated testes than ovaries, similar to reported female-biased expression in Olive flounder [147].Consistent with observations during MT-induced gonadal masculinisation in tilapia [40], we found cyp11a1, hsd3b1 and cyp19a1a transcripts were reduced when juvenile zebrafish were treated with MT. We also found that MT treatment actively promoted cyp11c1 and hsd11b2 expression in zebrafish gonads. Cyp11c1 works together with hsd11b2 to convert androgens into 11-oxygenated androgens. This contrasts with studies in rainbow trout which found downregulated cyp11c1 expression during androgen-induced gonadal masculinisation using 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione [41, 45]. Despite both being 11-KT precursors, MT and 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione produce different intermediate products with different androgenic potencies. It is possible that MT induces gonadal masculinisation by different mechanisms to those employed by 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione, perhaps via these differing intermediate products.Our results suggest that androgen production may also be important for natural juvenile ovary-to-testis gonadal transformation in zebrafish. Cyp11c1 and hsd11b2 expression was higher in transforming testes than juvenile ovaries during juvenile ovary-to-testis transformation at 40 dpf. This concurs with the higher levels of cyp11c1 expression previously reported in juvenile ovotestes compared to juvenile ovaries amid zebrafish juvenile ovary-to-testis transformation [13, 143]. This indicates that the steroidogenic enzymes required for androgen production are active during early stages of juvenile ovary-to-testis transformation. We found that pathways involved in cortisol biosynthesis from cholesterol and cortisone biosynthesis and metabolism and androgen receptor nuclear signalling were higher in transforming testes than MT-treated testes at 40 dpf. Cortisol and androgen signalling pathways were shown to be linked in high temperature-induced masculinisation of pejerrey via hsd11b2 [148]. This suggests that hsd11b2-mediated androgen production may be important for testicular differentiation in zebrafish.Taken together, our data show that increased 11-oxygenated androgen production and decreased aromatase expression may be equally important for MT-induced gonadal masculinisation in zebrafish.The juvenile ovary-to-testis transformation process in zebrafish is characterised by oocyte apoptosis [71]. In zebrafish, genes in pro-apoptotic pathways (tp53) have been implicated in testicular differentiation [149], while anti-apoptotic pathways (NF-κB) promote ovarian differentiation [150]. Partial or complete germ cell depletion in gonads invariably leads to gonadal masculinisation [88, 149, 151, 152].Gonadal hormones can regulate germ cell apoptosis in vertebrates [153, 154] including teleost fish [5]. In zebrafish, 17α-ethinylestradiol and fadrozole can alter germ cell apoptosis and proliferation during gonad differentiation [54]. Several genes that regulate cell apoptosis and proliferation are also involved in gonadal sexual differentiation [155]. A threshold of germ cells or meiotic oocytes is required for ovarian development in zebrafish [152, 156] such that the phenotypic sex in zebrafish depends critically on the number of germ cells in gonads during early development [88, 152, 157]. How germ cell numbers maintain female identity is not fully understood.We observed that MT treatment downregulates genes involved in DNA replication in early S phase, Estrogen Receptor 1 (Esr1) regulation of G1/S phase, mitogenic action of Estradiol /Esr1 and ligand-dependent activation of the Estrogen receptor 1/ Specificity Protein (Esr1/Sp) pathway in 40 dpf juvenile ovaries. We suggest that androgens may induce female-to-male sex reversal via modulation of germ cell proliferation rates. MT-induced repression of estrogen-activated mitotic pathways in juvenile ovaries leads us to hypothesise that MT may trigger female-to-male sex reversal via inhibition of estrogen-activated proliferation of oocytes in zebrafish ovaries. This would reduce oocyte numbers below the threshold, leading to activation of male-specific gene expression in gonadal somatic cells.In this study, we used transgenic zebrafish derived from domesticated zebrafish strains. Domesticated zebrafish strains use polygenic sex determination [58, 59] and are sensitive to environmental and hormonal factors [32, 53, 61, 63, 158]. The sensitivity of domesticated zebrafish strains to hormonal effects on gonad development render them good models for determining the mode of action of androgens on induction of testicular differentiation. Evidence comparing Atlantic Silverside utilising genetic sex determination (GSD) and temperature sex determination (TSD) suggest that expression of cyp19a1a, a key gene in ovarian development, was earlier, stronger, more sexually dimorphic and less temperature sensitive in GSD strains than TSD strains [159]. It is possible that the thresholds of environmental and hormonal sensitivity for key sex determining loci may vary between wild (ZZ/ZW sex determination) and domesticated (polygenic sex determination) zebrafish strains. Different mechanisms may be activated for androgen-induced sex reversal of wild zebrafish populations. Future studies using wild strains would facilitate elucidation of the pathways involved. Due to the polygenic mode of sex determination and lack of sex-linked markers in domesticated zebrafish strains, we were unable to distinguish between male and female zebrafish prior to morphological gonadal differentiation. Therefore, the MT treatment was conducted on zebrafish with unknown proportions of male and female sexual genotypes. This resulted in production of populations comprising males and neo-males. The development and use of all-male and all-female zebrafish lines [160] in future studies would help further clarify whether MT treatment has different effects on genetic males and females.In conclusion, zebrafish MT-induced gonadal masculinisation involves activation of pro-male gene expression and repression of pro-female gene expression. Steroidogenic enzymes critical for 11-oxygenated androgen production (cyp11c1 and hsd11b2) and estrogen production (cyp19a1a) were among genes differentially expressed in response to MT treatment suggesting that androgen production and aromatase inhibition appear to both be important for zebrafish androgen-induced gonadal masculinisation. MT-induced epigenetic modification of histones and inhibition of estrogen-activated germ cell proliferation via cyp19a1a downregulation may be two of the key mechanisms which mediate female-to-male sex reversal in zebrafish.Control ovaryControl testisDays post fertilisationEstrogen Receptor 1Gene ontology consortium17α-methyltestosteronePolymerase chain reactionQuantitative real-time polymerase chain reactionRNA sequencingReads per kilobase per million mapped readsSpecificity Protein transcription factorSegner H, Casanova-Nakayama A, Kase R, Tyler CR.

View our privacy policyDead end (dnd), vertebrate-specific germ cell marker, had been demonstrated to be essential for primordial germ cell (PGC) migration and survival, and the link between PGC number and sex change had been revealed in some teleost species, but little is known about dnd in hermaphroditic vertebrates. In the present study, a protogynous hermaphroditic orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) dnd homologue (Ecdnd) was identified and characterized. Quantitative real-time PCR and in situ hybridization analysis revealed a dynamic and sexually dimorphic expression pattern in PGCs and germ cells of gonads. During sex changing, the Ecdnd transcript sharply increased in early transitional gonad, reached the highest level at late transitional gonad stage, and decreased after testis maturation. Visualization of zebrafish PGCs by injecting with RFP-Ecdnd-3′UTR RNA and GFP-zfnanos3-3′UTR RNA confirmed importance of Ecdnd 3′UTR for the PGC distribution. In addition, knockdown of EcDnd by using antisense morpholinos (MO) caused the ablation of PGCs in orange-spotted grouper. Therefore, the current data indicate that Ecdnd is essential for PGCs survival and may serve as a useful germ cell marker during gametogenesis in hermaphroditic grouper.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Although much work has been reported on nERs in the zebrafish, there is a lack of direct genetic evidence for their functional roles and importance in reproduction. To address this issue, we undertook this study to disrupt all three nERs in the zebrafish, namely esr1 (ERα), esr2a (ERβII), and esr2b (ERβI), by the genome-editing technology clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and its associated nuclease (CRISPR/Cas9). Using this loss-of-function genetic approach, we successfully created three mutant zebrafish lines with each nER knocked out. In addition, we also generated all possible double and triple knockouts of the three nERs. The phenotypes of these mutants in reproduction were analyzed in all single, double, and triple nER knockouts in both females and males. Surprisingly, all three single nER mutant fish lines display normal reproductive development and function in both females and males, suggesting functional redundancy among these nERs. Further analysis of double and triple knockouts showed that nERs, especially Esr2a and Esr2b, were essential for female reproduction, and loss of these two nERs led to an arrest of folliculogenesis at previtellogenic stage II followed by sex reversal from female to male. In addition, the current study also revealed a unique role for Esr2a in follicle cell proliferation and transdifferentiation, follicle growth, and chorion formation. Taken together, this study provides the most comprehensive genetic analysis for differential functions of esr1, esr2a, and esr2b in fish reproduction.Estrogens, the major female sex steroids, have well-known functions in both reproductive and nonreproductive processes, and they act throughout the whole lifespan of females from embryonic development to adult life (1–4). Despite the discovery of a membrane G protein–coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1/GPR30) for nongenomic actions of estrogens (5), the majority of estrogenic activities is believed to be mediated via nuclear estrogen receptors (nERs), which function as transcription factors upon ligand binding for genomic responses (6, 7).In most vertebrates, including mammals, birds, and some lower vertebrates, two estrogen receptors (ERs) have been identified—namely ERα and ERβ—and they are encoded by two distinct genes ESR1 and ESR2, respectively (8). Both ERs belong to the nuclear receptor family, which mostly function as ligand-dependent transcription factors (9). Following their specific interaction with the ligands or estrogens, the ligand/receptor complex dimerizes to recognize and bind with high affinity to specific DNA sequences, or estrogen response elements, located in promoter regions of target genes, where they interact with other transcription factors to modulate gene transcription (7, 9).The nERs and their functions have been extensively studied both in vivo and in vitro in various model systems, and the most direct evidence for nER functions has been provided by nER knockout (KO) mice (2, 10). In ERα KO (αERKO) mice, the females are infertile, and their ovarian follicles fail to mature and ovulate, forming hemorrhagic cysts. Interestingly, the male KO is also infertile (11, 12). In contrast, the ovary of βERKO mice appears grossly normal with follicles at all stages of development; however, there are fewer corpora lutea in the ovary, and the animals are subfertile. In contrast to αERKO, βERKO males are fertile (13, 14). In addition, mice lacking both receptors (αβERKO) are viable but infertile in both sexes (8, 15, 16), and αβERKO females show a phenotype of cell transdifferentiation from granulosa cells to Sertoli cells, consistent with the phenotype observed in aromatase-deficient mice (17).In teleosts, in addition to the two nERs just mentioned, there are two ERβ subtypes, namely ERβI and ERβII, which appear to arise from specific duplication of the ERβ gene in fish lineage (18–20). ERα shows homology across vertebrates, whereas teleost ERβII is conserved with mammalian ERβ and ERβI has no mammalian homolog. The three nERs in fish have been extensively studied for subtype-specific functions by using nER-dependent receptor-reporter assays, subtype-specific RNA interference, and subtype-selective ligands (21–23). In contrast to that in mammals, fish ERβ forms bind estradiol (E2) with higher affinity than does ERα in several species, including the Atlantic croaker, channel catfish, and zebrafish (24).In the zebrafish, there also exist three subtypes of nERs—Esr1/esr1 (ERα), Esr2a/esr2a (ERβII), and Esr2b/esr2b (ERβI)—and they are expressed widely in both reproductive and nonreproductive tissues at varying expression levels (19). In the brain, the three nERs exhibit distinct expression patterns and, in the liver, they respond to E2 differently, with esr1 increasing its expression, esr2b decreasing, and esr2a showing no response to the treatment (19, 25). During embryonic development, high levels of esr2a and esr2b transcripts of maternal origin were demonstrated by whole-mount in situ hybridization; however, the expression level of esr1 was low in the embryos at 24 hours postfertilization (hpf) (26). The experiments with morpholino knockdown suggested that esr2a was involved in neuromast development, and disrupting maternal esr2a caused alteration of a range of transcripts in early embryos, resulting in lethal malformations in the zebrafish larvae (27, 28). More recently, a study of morpholino-mediated knockdown of esr1, esr2a, and esr2b in zebrafish embryos indicated that esr1 and esr2a acted separately or cooperatively on specific target genes, whereas the role of esr2b was still unclear (29).Although much work has been reported on nERs in the zebrafish, it is still difficult to describe the exact roles of each subtype in vivo, especially the potential subfunctionalization of the two ERβ subtypes. To address this issue, we undertook this study to analyze reproductive functions of each nER subtype in vivo by using a reverse genetics approach. Using the emerging genome editing technology, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated nuclease (Cas9), we successfully created three mutant zebrafish lines with each nER knocked out. In addition, we also generated all possible double and triple knockouts of the three nERs. The phenotypes of reproductive development and function were analyzed in all single, double, and triple nER knockouts in both females and males. This study provides the most comprehensive genetic analysis for differential functions of esr1, esr2a, and esr2b in teleosts.The wild-type (WT) zebrafish of AB strain was used in the current study to produce mutant lines. Zebrafish were maintained in the ZebTEC multilinking rack system (Tecniplast, Buguggiate, Italy) with water temperature at 28 ± 1°C, conductivity at 400 μS/cm, pH at 7.5 and photoperiod of 14 hours (light) to 10 hours (dark). All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines and approval of the Animal Ethics Committee of University of Macau.The zebrafish esr1, esr2a, and esr2b single mutants were generated by CRISPR/Cas9-induced gene KO method. Briefly, the CRISPR/Cas9 target sites were designed by using the online tool (ZiFiT Targeter Version 4.2). The Cas9 messenger RNA and target single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were generated by in vitro transcription from pCS2-nCas9n and DraI-digested pDR274 sgRNA constructs respectively with the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 or T7 kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The plasmids used were obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA). The Cas9 messenger RNA and sgRNA were comicroinjected into one- or two-cell–stage embryos using the Drummond Nanoject injector (Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA). The F0 founders carrying mosaic mutations were identified by high-resolution melt analysis and heteroduplex motility assay, and mated with WT fish to generate heterozygous F1 offspring as described in our previous reports (30, 31). The esr1 single mutant was created by segmental deletion involving coinjection of two sgRNAs targeting two CRISPR/Cas9 sites, resulting in a deletion of –83 base pairs (bp) fragment between the two target sites.For double gene knockouts, the esr2a heterozygotes (esr2a+/−) and esr2b heterozygotes (esr2b+/−) were outcrossed to obtain esr2a+/−;esr2b+/− heterozygotes first followed by self-crossing to obtain the esr2a−/−;esr2b−/− homozygous mutants. Mutant genotypes were confirmed by high-resolution melt analysis and sequencing. The esr1−/−;es2b−/− double mutants were obtained in the same way. However, esr1 and esr2a are located closely on chromosome 20, making it difficult to generate the double mutant of esr1−/−;esr2a−/− by crossing. Therefore, we performed a second gene deletion for esr2a in the embryos of esr1−/− background. The F1 esr1−/−;esr2a+/− were selected to outcross with WT fish to obtain the esr1+/−;esr2a+/− with the mutation of both genes located on the same chromosome. Then, these esr1+/−;esr2a+/− heterozygotes were self-crossed to obtain the homozygous double mutant esr1−/−;esr2a−/−.For triple mutant of the three nER subtypes, the esr1+/−;esr2a+/− heterozygote described previously was crossed with the esr2b−/− single mutant to obtain the esr1+/−;esr2a+/−;esr2b+/− heterozygote followed by self-crossing to generate the esr1−/−;esr2a−/−;esr2b−/− triple mutant.The fish were sampled at different time points. They were photographed first before measuring the body weight and standard body length. Briefly, the fish were anesthetized with MS-222 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and placed on a petri dish cover to measure body length followed by weight determination on an analytical balance. The fish were immediately fixed in Bouin’s solution for at least 24 hours followed by dehydration and embedding in paraffin. The samples were sectioned at 6-μm thickness using the Leica microtome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The sections were deparaffinized, hydrated, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and mounted with Canada balsam (Sigma-Alsrich) for examination with Nikon ECLIPSE Ni-U Upright microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Sibling WT (+/+) and/or heterozygous (+/−) fish were used as control for phenotype analysis.Total RNA was isolated from ovaries and testes using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and quantified with NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) based on the absorbance at 260 nm. Reverse transcription was performed on 3 μg total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instruction, and the complementary DNA (cDNA) products were used as templates for expression analysis.Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis was used to determine the transcription levels of target genes in the gonads. The reaction was performed on the CFX96 real-time system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) in a volume of 20 μl containing 10 μl of 2 x SuperMix, 0.2 μM of each primer, and 9.5 μl of cDNA template. To control the variation due to difference in RNA loading, each sample was normalized to the expression level of the ef1a gene. The specific primers used in the qPCR were listed in Supplemental Table 1.Fertility assessment was performed as described (30). The fertility of control fish or mutants was assessed by natural mating with WT zebrafish. Individuals that failed to spawn or produce fertilized embryos after at least 10 trials were considered infertile.The expression plasmids for three WT nER subtypes (Esr1, Esr2a, and Esr2b) and pSEAP/zfLHB promoter reporter plasmid were constructed in our previous study (Lin and Ge, data not shown). The cDNA open reading frames encoding the mutant nERs were amplified from the ovary of each single mutant fish with primers listed in Supplemental Table 1 and inserted into pBK-CMV vector (Invitrogen) to generate expression plasmids for mutant Esr1, Esr2a, and Esr2b. PCR amplification was carried out with PrimeSTAR high-fidelity Taq DNA polymerase (Takara, Shiga, Japan), and the constructs were sequenced in both directions to confirm sequence authenticity.The murine gonadotroph cell line, LβT2 cells, was grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and double antibiotics (penicillin-streptomycin; Gibco). The cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2. LβT2 cells were chosen in the current study for expressing zebrafish LHβ (lhb) promoter-driven reporter secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP). For reporter gene assay, the cells were plated to 24-well plates (105 cells/well) 24 hours prior to transfection and were transiently cotransfected with the reporter pSEAP/zfLHB and WT or each mutant nER expression vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen; 1 μL/well). The amounts of vectors used were specified in the figure legends. The transfection medium was replaced 4 hours later with fresh medium without antibiotics, and the SEAP activities were measured 48 hours later with the SEAP assay kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Each transfection reaction was carried out in triplicate, and the experiments were repeated at least three times. An internal control vector for pSV-β-galactosidase was included in the transfection, and the enzyme activity was evaluated with the β-galactosidase enzyme assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). All the transfections were normalized by the activity of pSV-β-galactosidase.Ultrastructural analysis was performed on the follicles of both WT and esr2a-deficient female zebrafish at the age of 4 months. The preparation of EM samples was performed according to the established protocols (32, 33). Briefly, the fully grown follicles from both genotypes were separated from freshly dissected ovaries and fixed immediately in 25 mM CaCo buffer, pH 7.2, containing 2% glutaraldehyde (volume to volume) and 10% picric acid (weight to volume) at room temperature for 15 minutes and then 4°C overnight. After briefly washing with CaCo buffer, the follicles were incubated in the second fixative (2% osmium tetroxide and 0.5% potassium ferricyanide in 25 mM CaCo buffer, pH 7.2) at room temperature for 2 hours. After washing twice in water, the samples were dehydrated in an acetone series, infiltrated, and embedded in Spurr’s resin. The samples were thin-sectioned at 70 nm using the Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems) and stained with methanolic uranyl acetate (2%) and Reynold's lead citrate. The sections were observed on the Hitachi H-7650 transmission electron microscope with a charge-coupled device camera (Hitachi High-Technologies, Tokyo, Japan) operated at 80 kV.Data were analyzed by Student’s t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey multiple comparison test using Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). All values were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean. Significance was set at P < 0.05.To disrupt each nER subtype, we targeted esr1 exon 2, esr2a exon 2, and esr2b exon 1 within the open reading frame region and downstream of the translation start site to generate esr1, esr2a, and esr2b single mutants, respectively [Fig. 1(A)]. For esr1 mutant, an 83-bp fragment deletion with a new stop codon nearby was selected for phenotype analysis, and this mutation disrupted the major splicing variants encoding long and short isoforms, ERαL, ERαS, and ERαS-Cx, as reported previously (34). For esr2a and esr2b, a 10-bp deletion leading to frame shifting of the coding region was selected for further analysis. To demonstrate that esr1, esr2a, and esr2b were successfully disrupted in these mutants, we first examined esr1, esr2a, and esr2b transcripts in adult gonads from WT control and the mutants esr1−/−, esr2a−/−, and esr2b−/−, respectively, using reverse transcription PCR. Mutation-specific primers (F1, F2, and F3) over the deleted sequences of esr1−/−, esr2a−/−, and esr2b−/− were used for the amplification. The disruption of functional transcripts for esr1, esr2a, and esr2b was confirmed by DNA sequencing [Fig. 1(B)].Targeted disruption of three zebrafish nER subtype genes, esr1, esr2a, and esr2b.

(B) Reverse transcription PCR analysis for esr1, esr2a, and esr2b mutations. The mutation of esr1, esr2a, and esr2b genes at the transcription level was confirmed by reverse transcription PCR and DNA sequencing.

(C) Effects of the mutated Esr1, Esr2a, and Esr2b on the basal or E2-inducted zebrafish lhb promoter activity in the LβT2 cells. The pBK-CMV empty vector and the expression vectors for WT or mutated nERs (400 ng/well) were each cotransfected with the pSEAP/zfLHb (–1100) promoter construct (500 ng/well) together with the internal control pSV-β-galactosidase expression vector (400 ng/well). After 24-hour incubation, the cells were incubated with phenol red-free medium and treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (open bars) or E2 (100 nM, black bars) for 24 hours. The SEAP activity was normalized to that of β-gal and presented as the fold of the SEAP activity of the control transfected with pBK-CMV. Each bar represents mean ± standard error of the mean (n=3). ***P < 0.001 vs pBK-CMV empty vector control; #significant difference (P < 0.001) observed with mutated estrogen receptors. (D) Chromosomal location of zebrafish esr1 and esr2a genes.To further confirm the functional loss of Esr1, Esr2a, and Esr2b proteins in the mutant zebrafish, we carried out a receptor-reporter assay in the LβT2 cells based on our previous observation that zebrafish nERs significantly increased the transcriptional activity of zebrafish LHβ (lhb) promoter in this cell line (Lin and Ge, unpublished). Our data confirmed this observation. All three WT forms of zebrafish nERs could significantly increase the basal and E2-stimulated transcriptional activity of lhb promoter. In contrast and as expected, none of the three mutant nERs had any effect on the basal and E2-stimuated response [Fig. 1(C)]. These data indicate that our disruption of esr1, esr2a, and esr2b resulted in a null mutation for each gene with a loss of the functional protein.The esr2a and esr2b double heterozygous zebrafish (esr2a+/−;esr2b+/−), obtained from breeding esr2a+/− females with esr2b−/− males, were inbred to generate double homozygous mutant (esr2a−/−;esr2b−/−). The double mutant of esr1−/−;esr2b−/− was obtained in the same way. However, the same method did not work for esr1 and esr2a despite repeated trials because the two genes are located closely on the same chromosome or genetically linked [Fig. 1(D)]. To obtain esr1−/−;esr2a−/− double mutant, we performed a secondary CRISPR/Cas9 targeting for esr2a in the embryos of esr1−/− background as described in the method followed by genotyping, breeding, and selection [MUT2 with –23 bp deletion in Fig. 1(B)].To create triple mutant of the three nERs, the linked heterozygote esr1+/−;esr2a+/− and homozygote esr2b−/− were crossed to obtain triple heterozygote esr1+/−;esr2a+/−;esr2b+/−, which was then self-crossed to obtain the triple mutant triple homozygous mutant esr1−/−;esr2a−/−;esr2b−/−.When examined at 90 days postfertilization (dpf), all single nER mutants showed a male-biased sex ratio (70% to 85%) compared with the WT zebrafish (57%). Similar ratios were observed in the double mutants esr1−/−;esr2a−/− (82%) and esr1−/−;esr2b−/− (76%). The ratio of females in the double mutant esr2a−/−;esr2b−/− was the lowest among the three double mutants (93% males), which was comparable to the triple mutant [95%; Fig. 2(H)]. At the age of 4 months (120 dpf), all double mutant esr2a−/−;esr2b−/− and triple mutant esr1−/−;esr2a−/−;esr2b−/− individuals were males.Sex ratio and embryonic development of esr1, esr2a, and esr2b single, double, and triple mutants. (A–G) The fertility of homozygous male mutant fish was assessed by natural mating with WT female fish. (A′–E′) The fertility of homozygous female mutant fish were assessed by natural mating with WT male fish. There was no female in the double mutant esr2a−/−;esr2b−/− and triple mutant esr1−/−;esr2a−/−;esr2b−/−, and their males were fertile. (H) Sex ratios of all genotypes at 90 dpf.The fertility tests showed that all males of the single, double, and triple mutants were fully fertile and the embryos developed healthily and hatched normally [Fig. 2(A–G)]. For females, all single nER mutants were fertile as well as the females of double mutants esr1−/−;esr2a−/− and esr1−/−;esr2b−/− [Fig. 2(A′–E′)]. Because all individuals of the double mutant esr2a−/−;esr2b−/− and triple mutant were males at the time of fertility test (6 months), no female fertility data were available for these lines. Interestingly, although the females of esr1−/−;esr2a−/− showed normal fertility, the loss of one esr2b allele in the esr1−/−;esr2a−/− background (esr1−/−;esr2a−/−;esr2b+/−) resulted in a reduced fertility at the age of 6 months (data not shown).Histological analysis was performed on the gonads of all single, double, and triple mutants at 120 dpf. All mutant males showed normal testicular growth as compared with that of the WT control, and histological examination demonstrated normal spermatogenesis in the testes [Fig. 3(G) and 3(H); Supplemental Fig. 1]. As for females, all single mutants and double mutant esr1−/−;esr2b−/− showed normal ovarian growth and folliculogenesis as compared with the control with all stages of follicles present in the ovaries [Fig. 3(A–D) and 3(F)]. Interestingly, although the double mutant esr1−/−;esr2a−/− also showed normal ovarian growth and folliculogenesis, its previtellogenic oocytes (PV stage) were often surrounded by multilayered follicle cells instead of one in the control and other mutant lines [Fig. 3(E)]. No females were available for analysis in the double mutant esr2a−/−;esr2b−/− and triple mutant esr1−/−;esr2a−/−;esr2b−/−.Anatomical and histological analysis of the gonads at 120 dpf in the (A) control and (B–D) single, (E–G) double, and (H) triple mutants. (G and H) All individuals of the double mutant esr2a−/−;esr2b−/− and triple mutant esr1−/−;esr2a−/−;esr2b-/ were males with normal spermatogenesis. The testes of other genotypes are shown in Supplemental Fig. 1. Arrowheads show the hyperplasia of the interfollicular stromal cells.To provide evidence for roles of nERs in gonadal differentiation, we examined gonadal development at 30 dpf when the gonads start to differentiate in the zebrafish (35, 36). As shown in Fig. 4, all single, double, and triple mutants had individuals at different stages of gonadal differentiation, including the ovary with well-developed late perinucleolar oocytes, gonads with early perinucleolar oocytes (juvenile ovary), transforming gonads with degenerating oocyte-like germ cells and increased stromal tissues, and undifferentiated gonads. Some individuals showed early spermatogenesis in the gonads. We did not observe any obvious deviation from the normal course of gonadal differentiation in any mutant lines (Fig. 4).Gonad development at 30 dpf in the controls and mutants. Juvenile ovaries with typical perinucleolar oocytes were found in the control and all single, double, and triple mutants. Some individuals showed oocyte-like germ cells undergoing degeneration (arrowheads). (A′–P′) are magnified images of the boxed areas in (A–P), respectively.Our previous studies have shown that the process of gonadal differentiation in the zebrafish has completed by 45 dpf and most female fish are undergoing puberty onset, which is marked by the appearance of cortical alveoli in the oocytes (30, 35, 37). To examine if nERs play any roles at this stage of development, we performed histological analysis at 45 dpf on all single, double, and triple mutants (Fig. 5). For all genotypes analyzed, the sizes and development of testes were similar to the control [Supplemental Fig. 2(A–H) and 2(A′–H′)]. For single mutant females, the ovaries were all normal with PV follicles containing cortical alveoli in the oocytes, indicating normal puberty onset compared with the control [Fig. 5(A–D) and 5(A′–D′)]. Similarly, esr1−/−;esr2b−/− double mutant females also showed well-developed ovaries with PV follicles [Fig. 5(F) and 5(F′) and 5(J) and 5(J′)]. However, in esr1−/−;esr2a−/− double mutant females, although the ovaries also contained PV follicles, there existed a significantly higher amount of stromal cells between the follicles [Fig. 5(E) and 5(E′)]. One individual was found to have the ova-testis structure [Fig. 5(I) and 5(I′)]. For esr2a−/−;esr2b−/− double mutant and triple mutant, although all adults were males at 120 dpf as described earlier, females did exist in these mutants at 45 dpf [Fig. 5(G), 5(H), 5(G′), and 5(H′)]. Interestingly, the ovaries of these mutant females also contained increased amounts of stromal cells and large number of degenerating oocytes, which are not often seen at this stage of gonadal development [Fig. 5(K), 5(L), 5(K′), and 5(L′)].Gonad development at 45 dpf in the controls and mutants (for testis, see Supplemental Fig. 2). The gonadal differentiation had finished in all genotypes and the females were entering puberty as shown by the PV follicles in the ovaries. Two representative individuals are shown for double and triple mutants. (A′–L′) are magnified images of the boxed areas in (A–L), respectively.

To evaluate the roles of nERs in female maintenance, we investigated the developmental status of gonads in WT control and all nER mutants at 60 and 90 dpf. In our aquarium system, the zebrafish can start spawning as early as 60 dpf.The males of all single, double, and triple nER mutants showed well-developed testes at 60 dpf compared with the control [Supplemental Fig. 2(I–P) and 2(I′–P′)]. In females, the ovaries of control fish contained all stages of developing follicles from primary growth to late vitellogenic follicles [Fig. 6(A) and 6(A′)]. Compared with the age-matched controls, the ovaries from esr1−/− mutant displayed similar developmental status [Fig. 6(B) and 6(B′)]. In contrast, most individuals from single mutants esr2a−/− and esr2b−/−, double mutants esr1−/−;esr2a−/−, esr1−/−;esr2b−/− and esr2a−/−;esr2b−/−, and triple mutant esr1−/−;esr2a−/−;esr2b−/− contained PV follicles only in the ovaries with few vitellogenic ones [Fig. 6(C–H) and 6(C′–H′)] except a few individuals [Fig. 6(J) and 6(J′)]. The hyperproliferation of stromal cells and degenerating follicles was apparent in the ovaries of both esr1−/−;esr2a−/− [Fig. 6(E), 6(I), 6(E′), and 6(I′)] and esr2a−/−;esr2b−/− [Fig. 6(G) and 6(G′)] double mutants. For esr2a−/−;esr2b−/− mutants, the female ratio was lower than 4% (1/27) at 60 dpf and 18% individuals (5/27) had ova-testis gonads [Fig. 6(K) and 6(K′)], suggesting a female-to-male sex reversal. No typical ovaries were found in the triple mutant esr1−/−;esr2a−/−;esr2b−/− and all individuals examined were male [n = 15; Fig. 6(L) and 6(L′)], with only one individual having ova-testis with well-formed testicular tissue and primary growth and PV follicles [Fig. 6(H) and 6(H′)].Gonad development at 60 dpf in the controls and mutants (for testis, see Supplemental Fig. 2). Compared with the (A) age-matched controls, the ovary of (B) esr1−/− mutant displayed similar developmental status with vitellogenic follicles of advanced stages; however, the ovaries of the (C–H and I) other genotypes all contained PV follicles only with few vitellogenic ones except (F) a few individuals. Ovotestes were commonly observed in both esr2a−/−;esr2b−/− double mutant and triple mutant. No typical ovaries were found in the triple mutant esr1−/−;esr2a−/−;esr2b−/−. (A′–L′) are magnified images of the boxed areas in (A–L), respectively. Arrowheads show the hyperplasia of the interfollicular stromal cells in the ovaries of double mutants esr1−/−;esr2a−/− and esr2a−/−;esr2b−/− and triple mutant esr1−/−;esr2a−/−;esr2b−/−.Zebrafish becomes sexually mature at 90 dpf. All nER mutants had normal testes in males with spermatogenesis comparable to that in the control (Supplemental Fig. 3). As for females, the three single mutants and double mutants esr1−/−;esr2a−/− and esr1−/−;esr2b−/− were fertile with normal folliculogenesis in the ovaries comparable to that in the control (Fig. 7) although the hyperplasia of somatic cells continued to exist in the esr1−/−;esr2a−/− ovary [Fig. 7(E) and 7(E′)]. In contrast, the double mutant esr2a−/−;esr2b−/− and triple mutant esr1−/−;esr2a−/−;esr2b−/− were all males with no females identified at 90 dpf except a few intersexual fish with ovo-testis [Fig. 7(G), 7(H), 7(G′), and 7(H′)].Gonad development at 90 dpf in the (A and A′) controls and mutants (for testis, see Supplemental Fig. 3). (B–F) As for females, the three single mutants and double mutants esr1−/−;esr2a−/− and esr1−/−;esr2b−/− were fertile with normal folliculogenesis in the ovaries comparable to that in the control. (G and H) The double-mutant esr2a−/−;esr2b−/− and triple-mutant esr1−/−;esr2a−/−;esr2b−/− had no true females except intersexual individuals. (A′–H′) are magnified images of the boxed areas in (A–H), respectively. Arrowheads show the hyperplasia of the interfollicular stromal cells.Although all single nER mutants were fertile in both males and females, esr2a−/− mutant exhibited an interesting phenotype. The fertilized eggs from female esr2a−/− mutant exhibited enlarged and deformed chorion, which often resulted in an oval or pear-shaped envelope after fertilization [Fig. 8(I) and 8(J)]. As a result, the embryos started to hatch as early as 24 hpf [Fig. 8(K) and 8(O)], and most had hatched by 48 hpf [Fig. 8(L) and 8(P)], earlier than those in the control [Fig. 8(C) and 8(D)] and esr1−/− mutant [Fig. 8(G) and 8(H)]. Similarly, eggs from the double mutant esr1−/−;esr2a−/− females also exhibited the same envelope after fertilization [Fig. 8(M) and 8(N)]. These results suggested that esr2a might have a potential role in the formation of the chorion during folliculogenesis.Phenotypic analysis of zebrafish embryos from 3 to 48 hpf. Homozygous mutant female (E–H) esr1−/−, (I–L) esr2a−/−, or (M–P) esr1−/−;esr2a−/− were crossed with heterozygous control males, respectively. Fertilized embryos were collected from (A–D) WT control and (E–T) mutants for phenotypic analysis. (Q–T) Embryos from heterozygous control female and male double mutant esr1−/−;esr2a−/− were used as the control. Arrowheads in (I), (J), (M), and (N) show deformed weak chorion. The insets are magnified images.To test this hypothesis, we examined the expression levels of the genes encoding major proteins of the envelope or zona pellucida (zp), including zp2, zp3, zp3a, zp3b, and zp3c, in the follicles of control and esr2a−/− mutant (Fig. 9). The qPCR analysis showed that three major components of the zp cluster genes, zp2, zp3, and zp3a, were significantly reduced in follicles of different stages in esr2a−/− mutant, especially early vitellogenic follicles. The other two, zp3b and zp3c, also showed a declined expression, but not significantly [Fig. 9(A)]. To provide evidence for the weak chorion of esr2a−/− eggs at ultrastructural level, we examined the chorion structure in fully grown follicles with transmission electron microscope. Surprisingly, no significant difference was observed between the control and esr2a−/− mutant [Fig. 9(B)].(A) Expression of zp proteins in the follicles of control and esr2a−/− mutant.

We did not observe drastic compensatory expression among the three nERs except that esr2b expression increased in the ovary of esr2a−/− mutant. Interestingly, the expression of esr2a decreased in the testes of esr1−/− and esr2b−/− mutants (Fig. 10).Expression of esr1, esr2a, and esr2b in the ovaries and testis of control and each single esr-deficient adult zebrafish. Total RNA from each ovary or testis was reverse transcribed for real-time PCR quantification of messenger RNA (mRNA) expression, which was normalized to ef1a (mean ± standard error of the mean, n = 6) and the control. *P < 0.05 vs control.Estrogens are essential female sex steroids that control all aspects of female development and function (4, 41). Estrogens signal through both nuclear and membrane receptors, with most reported effects of estrogens being mediated via the nERs (42, 43). In the current study, we disrupted all three forms of nERs in the zebrafish and analyzed the impact of their loss on reproduction in both females and males. The success of gene disruption was confirmed by the lhb promoter-driven reporter assay, which is highly responsive to nERs. In addition to single mutants esr1−/−, esr2a−/−, and esr2b−/−, we also created and analyzed all possible double (esr1−/−;esr2a−/−, esr1−/−;esr2b−/−, and esr2a−/−;esr2b−/−) and triple (esr1−/−;esr2a−/−;esr2b−/−) KO mutants. With these mutant lines, we focused on several key points of gonadal development for analysis, including gonadal differentiation at 30 dpf, puberty onset at 45 dpf, and maturation in adults at 60 and 90 dpf.Zebrafish is considered a juvenile hermaphroditic fish, whose gonad first develops as so-called juvenile ovary with oocyte-like germ cells at the early perinucleolar stage, followed by sexual differentiation into testis or true ovary, with fully developed oocytes of the late perinucleolar stage (35, 44, 45). The current study demonstrated that disruption of all three nERs individually had no effect on folliculogenesis in the ovary and spermatogenesis in the testis, and all single mutants were fertile in both sexes. Despite this, the nERs seem to play a role in influencing sex differentiation because all single, double, and triple mutants exhibited a male-biased sex ratio, and esr2a−/−;esr2b−/− and esr1−/−;esr2a−/−;esr2b−/− mutants showed all-male phenotype at 120 dpf. Some males in the mutants were obviously derived from female-to-male sex reversal because intersexual fish with ovo-testis were often observed from 45 to 90 dpf after the window of sex differentiation at 30 dpf. These results suggest a role for nERs in maintaining female status in adults.Recently we characterized the three nERs during folliculogenesis in the zebrafish. Interestingly, esr1 and esr2b were exclusively expressed in the somatic follicle cells, whereas esr2a was expressed in both follicle cells and oocytes. Furthermore, esr2a was the most abundantly expressed form during follicle growth among the three, and esr1 was the least abundant form during folliculogenesis (46). This result points to esr2a as the major indispensable form of nERs in the zebrafish ovary because it is the only form expressed in both compartments of the follicle with the highest expression level. The three nERs may compensate functions for each other in the somatic follicle cells because of their coexpression; however, the function of esr2a in the oocyte may not be compensated by the other two forms. This idea is supported by our KO work in the current study. As the least abundant form in the ovary, esr1 was dispensable among the three in both ovary and testis. In contrast, esr2a was the only form that exhibited significant phenotypes upon sex maturation (i.e., the deficient chorion and early hatching). Furthermore, the combination of esr2a−/− with either esr1−/− (esr1−/−;esr2a−/−) or esr2b−/− (esr2a−/−;esr2b−/−) caused a significant increase in the gonadal somatic cells, a sign toward maleness (44). Previous studies have reported a phenotype of somatic cell transdifferentiation in both αERKO and αβERKO mice in which the Sertoli-like cells were observed in adult ovaries (8, 16). This and our result suggest that nERs may play a role in gonadal differentiation or maintenance by influencing somatic environment in the gonads. Interestingly, despite the increase in somatic follicle cells in both esr1−/−;esr2a−/− and esr2a−/−;esr2b−/−, the follicles in esr1−/−;esr2a−/− could still proceed normally to late vitellogenic stages; in contrast, the follicles in the ovary of esr2a−/−;esr2b−/− mutant were completely arrested at PV stage. The same phenotype was also exhibited by the triple KO esr1−/−;esr2a−/−;esr2b−/−. These results strongly suggest that esr2a and esr2b have compensatory functions in maintaining female status. The loss of each gene individually had no phenotypic effect on ovarian development and function, but double mutation of both led to severe phenotype of follicle arrest followed by sex reversal to males. This is illustrated by the all-male phenotype and ovo-testis in both esr2a−/−esr2b−/− and esr1−/−;esr2a−/−;esr2b−/−. The functional compensation of esr2a and esr2b may likely occur in the somatic follicle cells where they are coexpressed.Among the three nERs, esr2a was the only one expressed in the oocytes (46). Its function in the oocytes may not be compensated by either esr1 or esr2b. This is supported by the unique phenotype of weakened chorion and early hatching displayed by esr2a−/− mutant by not the other two. This phenotype may be due to reduced expression of zp proteins including zp2, zp3, and zp3a, which are all expressed in the oocytes (47) and are likely the target genes of Esr2a. Interestingly, ultrastructural analysis with electron microscope did not show obvious difference in chorion structure between WT and esr2a−/− mutant, suggesting that the phenotype of deformed chorion displayed during embryonic development was likely due to changes of chorion structure at the molecular level.One intriguing observation of the current study was that the disruption of nERs in the zebrafish in any combination including the triple KO could not fully phenocopy the mutation of ovarian aromatase (cyp19a1a). Our recent study demonstrated that deletion of cyp19a1a gene by TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 in the zebrafish caused all-male development and the mutant failed to develop true ovary from the juvenile ovary-like gonad (36). In contrast, the triple nER mutant could form well-developed juvenile ovaries at 30 dpf and develop the true ovary at 45 dpf with PV follicles, which is the marker for female puberty onset (35). Therefore, despite all-male phenotype in both nER and cyp19a1a mutants, the underlying mechanisms were obviously different. The loss of aromatase blocked ovarian differentiation whereas the lack of nERs failed to maintain female status resulting in sex reversal from females to males. This result indicates that the process of gonadal differentiation is nER-independent in the zebrafish and E2 signaling during ovarian differentiation may involve alternative mechanisms. This nER-independent action of E2 has been reported in mammals and humans both in vivo (48) and in vitro (49), but the mechanism remains unclear. Other potential estrogen signaling pathways include membrane ER GPER1 (50) and estrogen-related receptors (ESRRs). ESRRs are orphan nuclear receptors with sequence and target gene similarity with nERs (51). Five forms of ESRR (α, β, γ, β/γ, and δ) have been identified in the zebrafish (52). A recent study showed that bisphenol A, an endocrine-disrupting chemical with estrogenic activities, could signal through ESRRγ (esrrga) in the zebrafish (53). The mechanism by which estrogens control ovarian differentiation in the zebrafish will be an interesting issue to address in future studies, which promise to provide clues to noncanonical signaling pathways of estrogens.In summary, using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene KO technology, we provided comprehensive genetic evidence for roles of the three zebrafish nER subtypes in the processes of gonadal differentiation, ovarian development and spawning. Surprisingly, all three single nER mutant fish lines displayed normal gonadal development and reproductive function in both males and females, suggesting functional redundancy among these three nERs in reproduction. Our results suggest that (1) esr1 is the most dispensable form among the three nERs in the zebrafish as its disruption caused no significant phenotype in both sexes; (2) esr2a shows the strongest phenotype among the three in terms of chorion structure and function; (3) mutation of esr2a in combination with mutation of either esr1 or esr2b induced hyperplasia of somatic cells between follicles, suggesting a compensatory role of esr1 and esr2b for esr2a; and (4) esr2a and esr2b are important for the maintenance of female status.CRISPR-associated nucleaseclustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeatsdays postfertilizationestradiolestrogen receptorestrogen receptor knockoutestrogen-related receptorhours postfertilizationknockoutnuclear estrogen receptorpolymerase chain reactionprevitellogenicquantitative polymerase chain reactionsecreted embryonic alkaline phosphatasesingle-guide RNAwild-typezona pellucida.This work was supported by the University of Macau (Grants MYRG2014-00062-FHS, MYRG2015-00227-FHS, MYRG2016-00072-FHS, and CPG2014-00014-FHS) and The Macau Fund for Development of Science and Technology (Grants FDCT114/2013/A3 and FDCT/089/2014/A2) (to W.G).Disclosure Summary: The authors have nothing to disclose.Google ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarAddress all correspondence and requests for reprints to: Wei Ge, PhD, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau, Avenida da Universidade, Taipa, Macau, China.

It furthers the University's objective of excellence in research, scholarship, and education by publishing worldwideAdvanced SearchFoxl2 is essential for mammalian ovary maintenance. Although sexually dimorphic expression of foxl2 was observed in many teleosts, its role and regulative mechanism in fish remained largely unclear. In this study, we first identified two transcript variants of foxl2a and its homologous gene foxl2b in zebrafish, and revealed their specific expression in follicular layer cells in a sequential and divergent fashion during ovary differentiation, maturation, and maintenance. Then, homozygous foxl2a mutants (foxl2a−/−) and foxl2b mutants (foxl2b−/−) were constructed and detailed comparisons, such as sex ratio, gonadal histological structure, transcriptome profiling, and dynamic expression of gonadal development-related genes, were carried out. Initial ovarian differentiation and oocyte development occur normally both in foxl2a−/− and foxl2b−/− mutants, but foxl2a and foxl2b disruptions result in premature ovarian failure and partial sex reversal, respectively, in adult females. In foxl2a−/− female mutants, sox9a-amh/cyp19a1a signaling was upregulated at 150 days postfertilization (dpf) and subsequently oocyte apoptosis was triggered after 180 dpf. In contrast, dmrt1 expression was greater at 105 dpf and increased several 100-fold in foxl2b−/− mutated ovaries at 270 dpf, along with other testis-related genes. Finally, homozygous foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/− double mutants were constructed in which complete sex reversal occurs early and testis-differentiation genes robustly increase at 60 dpf. Given mutual compensation between foxl2a and foxl2b in foxl2b−/− and foxl2a−/− mutants, we proposed a model in which foxl2a and foxl2b cooperate to regulate zebrafish ovary development and maintenance, with foxl2b potentially having a dominant role in preventing the ovary from differentiating as testis, as compared to foxl2a.SEX is one of the most intriguing puzzles in biology since antiquity, and has been considered “the queen of problems in evolutionary biology” (Bell 1982; Bachtrog et al. 2014). Most animals reproduce sexually, but the mechanisms of sex determination (SD) and differentiation are remarkably varied (Marín and Baker 1998; Barske and Capel 2008; Bonduriansky 2009; Williams and Carroll 2009; Gui and Zhu 2012; Matson and Zarkower 2012). Sex-determining mechanisms in teleosts are rapidly evolving and highly plastic but usually depend on genetic factors, with interactions between genetic and environmental factors affecting downstream differentiation (Devlin and Nagahama 2002; Volff et al. 2007; Desjardins and Fernald 2009; Mei and Gui 2015; Li et al. 2016). Three distinct SD genes, doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1Y (Dmy/dmrt1bY) (Matsuda et al. 2002), gonadal somatic cell derived factor (gsdf) (Myosho et al. 2012), and sex-determining region Y (SRY)-box 3 (sox3) (Takehana et al. 2014), were respectively identified from three medaka species, Oryzias latipes, O. luzonensis, and O. dancena; suggesting that SD genes are diverse among different teleost species even in the same genus. An additional three SD genes—anti-Mullerian hormone receptor type 2 (amhr2) in tiger pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes) (Kamiya et al. 2012), Y-linked anti-Mullerian hormone (Amhy) in silversides (Odontesthes hatchery) (Hattori et al. 2012), and sexually dimorphic on the Y chromosome (sdY) in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) (Yano et al. 2012)—were also identified as key factors to initiate testicular differentiation. During and after gonadal cell specification, germ cells and somatic cells mutually interact to coordinate sex differentiation of the gonads (Shinomiya et al. 2000; Devlin and Nagahama 2002; Siegfried and Nüsslein-Volhard 2008; Nishimura and Tanaka 2014). In most teleost species, ovarian differentiation begins with the proliferation of somatic cells and oogonia and early oocyte differentiation, while testicular differentiation usually occurs several weeks or months later than ovarian differentiation (Nakamura et al. 1998; Devlin and Nagahama 2002; Saito et al. 2007). In addition, sex in many fishes, even in some with heteromorphic sex chromosomes, is influenced or overrode by a variety of environmental and social cues, such as sex steroids, temperature, pH, salinity, density, hypoxia, and others (Baroiller et al. 2009; Desjardins and Fernald 2009; Mei and Gui 2015).Zebrafish (Danio rerio), as a vertebrate model animal (Grunwald and Eisen 2002), has been well studied in the contexts of development and disease. Yet, its primary SD and differentiation mechanisms still remain controversial (Nagabhushana and Mishra 2016). Although differentiated sex chromosomes were not found in domesticated zebrafish strains (AB and TU) (Sola and Gornung 2001), a sex-determining region was recently demonstrated in wild zebrafish on a subtelomeric region of the long arm of chromosome 4 (Anderson et al. 2012; Howe et al. 2013; Wilson et al. 2014). Zebrafish sex may be determined by multiple genes, along with the influences of primordial germ cells and environmental factors (Liew and Orban 2013; Nagabhushana and Mishra 2016). The early gonadal development of zebrafish is a complicated process. All gonads initially develop as an undifferentiated “juvenile ovary,” but approximately half of the ovarian tissues subsequently degenerate and transform into testicular tissue (Takahashi 1976). Although several key regulation genes—such as SRY-box 9 (sox9); nuclear receptor subfamily 5 group A (nr5a); cytochrome P450, family 19, subfamily A, polypeptide 1a (cyp19a1a); anti-Mullerian hormone (amh); GATA binding protein 4 (gata4); and Wilms tumor 1 (wt1)—show sexually dimorphic expression patterns and are involved in zebrafish gonad differentiation (Chiang et al. 2001; Trant et al. 2001; Rodríguez-Marí et al. 2005; Von Hofsten and Olsson 2005; Jorgensen et al. 2008; Sreenivasan et al. 2008), it is unclear which of these or others might serve as the initiator(s) or master switch(es) for zebrafish SD and subsequent differentiation.Forkhead (FKH) box (Fox) proteins which have a highly conserved 100 amino acid FKH DNA-binding domain (FHD), play specialized functions in many key biological processes (Carlsson and Mahlapuu 2002; Benayoun et al. 2011). Named after the Drosophila melanogaster gene fork head (fkh) (Weigel et al. 1989), >2000 family members have been identified in numerous species. Based on similarities in the FHD and unified nomenclature of Fox genes (Kaestner et al. 2000), Fox proteins are divided into 19 subfamilies, from FoxA to FoxS (Fetterman et al. 2008; Hannenhalli and Kaestner 2009). Foxl2, one of the earliest known markers of ovarian differentiation (Cocquet et al. 2002), is required for granulosa cell differentiation (Schmidt 2004) and to prevent transdifferentiation of an adult ovary to a testis by suppressing the SRY target gene Sox9 (Uhlenhaut et al. 2009). FOXL2 was first identified in blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) patients with eyelid and craniofacial malformations (Crisponi et al. 2001). In addition, FOXL2 mutation leads to premature ovarian failure (POF), a reduction in the number of germ cells in some BPES patients (De Baere et al. 2003; Meduri et al. 2010). In the Foxl2 null mouse, granulosa cells fail to undergo the squamous-to-cuboidal transition, which leads to arrest of folliculogenesis and oocyte atresia (Schmidt 2004; Kocer et al. 2008). In teleosts, foxl2 is expressed predominantly during ovary development of several species (Loffler et al. 2003), including Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) (Wang et al. 2004; Ijiri et al. 2008), rainbow trout (O. mykiss) (Baron 2004), dogfish (Scyliorhinus canicula) (Wotton et al. 2007), medaka (O. luzonensis) (Nakamoto et al. 2006), honeycomb grouper (Epinephelus merra) (Alam et al. 2008), wrasse (Halichoeres trimaculatus) (Kobayashi et al. 2010), African sharptooth catfish (Clarias gariepinus) (Sridevi and Senthilkumaran 2011; Bhat et al. 2016), and sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) (Smith et al. 2013). Additional studies have focused on associations of foxl2 with aromatase and sex hormones in the brain-pituitary-gonad axis (Nakamoto et al. 2006; Nakamoto et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2007; Yamaguchi et al. 2007; Von Schalburg et al. 2010; Navarro-Martín et al. 2011; Sridevi and Senthilkumaran 2011; Sridevi et al. 2012; Crespo et al. 2013). Two foxl2 homologous genes, foxl2 and foxl2-like, have been identified in zebrafish (Crespo et al. 2013) and are referred to here as foxl2a and foxl2b, respectively, in accordance with their phylogenetic relationship and current naming conventions. The sexually dimorphic expression pattern of zebrafish foxl2a was already reported (Siegfried and Nüsslein-Volhard 2008; Siegfried 2010; Caulier et al. 2015), however, its functional role and regulative mechanism remained largely unclear and the expression pattern and function of foxl2b were completely unknown. Here, we characterized a sequential and divergent foxl2a and foxl2b expression in zebrafish. Using a transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) approach (Li et al. 2013; Ota et al. 2013; Huang et al. 2014), we constructed mutants for foxl2a and foxl2b, and identified cooperative roles for these genes in regulating ovary differentiation and maintenance.The wild-type (WT) zebrafish of strain AB was used to produce mutant lines. Embryos were produced by in vitro fertilization according to the protocol described in the zebrafish book (Westerfield 2007). Each group for expression analysis consisted of 30 mutants and 30 WT zebrafish, which was reared in recirculating freshwater tanks from 4 dpf at 28.5° on a 14 hr light/10 hr dark cycle (Westerfield 2007). All procedures were performed with the approval of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.Total RNAs were isolated at different stages using SV RNA Isolation Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) and they were reverse transcribed with M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37° with Oligo (dT) Primer. To ascertain or reexamine full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences of foxl2a and foxl2b, a zebrafish oocyte SMART cDNA library was constructed according to the SMARTer PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit User Manual (Clontech). The foxl2a and foxl2b cDNAs were amplified by 3′ and 5′ RACE with primers (Supplemental Material, Table S1) designed according to the sequences in GenBank (NM_001045252.1 and XM_009298955.1). The complete cDNA sequences of foxl2a-1, foxl2a-2, and foxl2b were deposited in GenBank (accession numbers KR232688, KR232689, and KR232690, respectively).Multiple amino acid sequence alignment was performed with the Clustal X program and refined with GeneDoc software. Phylogenetic analysis was performed with the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA 5) software (Tamura et al. 2011) and the phylogenetic tree was constructed with neighbor-joining methods and 1000 bootstrap permutations. All the amino acid sequences used in the multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis were obtained from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and RefSeq (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/). The accession numbers are as follows: Homo sapiens FOXL2, NP_075555; Mus musculus FOXL2, NP_036150; Gallus gallus FOXL2, NP_001012630; Chrysemys picta FOXL2, XP_005282573; O. niloticus Foxl2, NP_001266707; O. latipes Foxl2, NP_001098358; Salmo salar Foxl2, XP_014018845; O. mykiss Foxl2, NP_001117957; Cyprinus carpio Foxl2, AKU47820; Gobiocypris rarus Foxl2, ADN38241; D. rerio Foxl2a, NP_001038717; D. rerio Foxl2b, NP_001304690; Kryptolebias marmoratus FoxL2, XP_017277495; Fundulus heteroclitus Foxl2, JAR75273; Dicentrarchus labrax Foxl2, ACW83540; T. rubripes Foxl2, XM_003968745; Xenopus tropicalis Foxl2, XP_004917868; D. rerio Foxl3, AAI62838; T. rubripes Foxl2-like, XP_011620275; O. mykiss Foxl3, NP_001117956; S. salar Foxl2-like, ADJ38819; K. marmoratus Foxl3, APD78564; F. heteroclitus Foxl2-like, XP_012705892; D. labrax Foxl3, AFV13295; O. latipes Foxl2-like, XP_004070713; D. labrax Foxl1, CBN81215; D. rerio Foxl1, NP_957278; O. latipes Foxl1, NP_001116391; X. tropicalis Foxl1, AAI35134; G. gallus FOXL1, XP_001231599; H. sapiens FOXL1, NP_005241; and M. musculus FOXL1, NP_032050. Syntenic analyses were carried out using information extracted from the Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org) genome and the chromosomal regions around foxl2s genes in H. sapiens chromosome 3, M. musculus chromosome 9, G. gallus chromosome 9, X. tropicalis chromosome 5, and D. rerio chromosome 2 and chromosome 15 were assembled.Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed on a DNA Engine Chromo4 Real Time System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with SYBR green qRT-PCR master mix (ToYoBo, Osaka, Japan) as described (Huang et al. 2009). All qRT-PCR reactions were performed in 20 μl reactions containing 10 μl 2× SYBR green master mix (Bio-Rad), 0.5 μl (10 μM) of each primer, 1 μl reverse transcriptase RT synthetic cDNA template, and 8 μl double distilled water. Samples were run with the following program parameters: 95° for 1 min, followed by 39 cycles of 95° for 15 sec, 60° for 30 sec, 76° for 5 sec, 79° for 5 sec, and 81° for 5 sec, ending with the melt curve 65–95°, with 0.5°/sec with each temperature lasting for 0.5 sec. Negative control (no-template DNA reaction) was always included. Specificity of amplification for each reaction was analyzed by dissociation curves using CFX manager software (Bio-Rad). To determine the optimal reference genes (Bustin et al. 2009), seven housekeeping genes—including actin, β1 (actb1); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh); glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd); TATA box binding protein (tbp); eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 α1, like 1 (eef1a1l1); polymerase (RNA) II (DNA directed) polypeptide D (polr2d); and succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit A, flavoprotein (sdha)—were selected to check their expression stability at the developmental stages and in the tissues analyzed. Rank ordering of expression stability using geNorm analysis (Vandesompele et al. 2002) identified actb1 (M value = 1.387 < 1.5) and sdha (1.37) as the most stable normalizers during developmental stages and in the tissues analyzed, while eef1a1l1 (1.805), tbp (1.839), gapdh (2.206), and g6pd (2.59) were the most variable. Therefore, actb1 was selected as the normalizer for qRT-PCR in this study, and the relative expression levels of target genes were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt method (Livak and Schmittgen 2001). All the samples were analyzed in triplicates.For antisense probe synthesis, T7 RNA polymerase promoter was added to the 5′ end of reverse primers and a DIG RNA Labeling Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was used. In brief, a 775-bp cDNA fragment of foxl2a and a 528-bp cDNA fragment of foxl2b were amplified by specific primers foxl2a probe N, foxl2a probe T7C, foxl2b probe N, and foxl2b probe T7C (Table S1). The ovarian tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS at 4° overnight. After washing with PBS (pH 7.0) three times, the samples were immersed in 30% saccharose-PBS buffer overnight at 4°, then embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature compound (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and sectioned to 10 μm in thickness using frozen microtomy (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). After being dried at 37° for 1 hr, the cryostat sections were stored at −70°. Messenger RNA (mRNA) detection by sectioned tissue in situ hybridization (Stahl and Simon 2010) was performed as previously described (Yin et al. 2007). Images were acquired by Zeiss Axio Observer A1 inverted microscope (Leica).The first exon sequences of foxl2a and foxl2b genomic loci from the Ensembl zebrafish genome browser were verified by PCR and sequencing. Potential TALEN target sites in the loci were searched using the TAL Effector Nucleotide Targeter (https://tale-nt-.cac.cornell.edu/) with the following parameters: (1) spacer length of 15–20, (2) repeat array length of 12 to 19, (3) T at position 0, and (4) a restriction enzyme cutting site in the spacer. Gene-specific TALEN constructs were assembled using the FastTALE TALEN Assembly Kit (Sidansai Biotechnology). The resulting arrays with TALEN backbones (left, pCS2-PEAS; and right, pCS2-PERR) were confirmed by sequencing.For in vitro transcription of these TALENs, pCS2-PEAS-foxl2a, pCS2-PERR-foxl2a, pCS2-PEAS-foxl2b, and pCS2-PERR-foxl2b were linearized with NotI and recovered as corresponding transcription templates. The transcriptions were carried out with the mMESSAGE and mMACHINE SP6 Kit (Ambion) and then quantified using NanoDrop-2000 (Thermo Scientific). The left arm and right arm mRNAs of each TALEN pair were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1 before microinjection, and the mRNA mixtures with 200–600 pg final concentrations were directly microinjected into zebrafish embryos at the one-cell stage.The injected embryos were hatched at 28.5°. At 24 hr after injection of TALEN mRNAs, genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from 20 randomly sampled embryos to evaluate the efficiency of TALEN-induced somatic mutations. The gDNA was obtained by the NaOH method (Meeker et al. 2007). The gDNA fragments including the target site of the TALENs were amplified using foxl2a and foxl2b gene-specific primers (Table S1). After digestion with BstN I (restriction enzyme cutting site in the spacer of foxl2a) or BsrD I (restriction enzyme cutting site in the spacer of foxl2b) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) respectively at 60° and 65° for 2 hr, the uncleaved DNA fragments were separated by gel electrophoresis and cloned into pMD-18T vector (Promega). Sequence alignments were generated to analyze whether or not the gDNA fragments from embryos injected with TALEN mRNAs were mutated.The F0 founders carrying mosaic mutations were mated with WT zebrafish to generate heterozygous F1 offspring. The heterozygous individuals with frameshift or nonsense sequence alterations in the F1 generation were selected by fin-clip assay. Male and female siblings of the F1 generation carrying the same mutation were mated to generate homozygous F2 mutants as described previously (Xiong et al. 2017).All fish sampled were anesthetized with MS-222 (tricaine methanesulfonate, 250 mg/l) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to measure body length and body weight. After the measurements, gonads of the fish were collected to calculate the gonadosomatic index (GSI) (gonadal weight/total body weight) values, and fixed in 4% PFA by overnight immersion. For histochemical analyses, 10-μm-thick sections were cut with frozen microtomy (Leica), stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Yulu, Nanchang, China), and mounted in neutral balsam (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, Shanghai, China). Hematoxylin-eosin staining is performed as previously described (Xia et al. 2007). The slides were imaged by Zeiss Axio Observer A1 inverted microscope (Leica).The ovaries from WT, foxl2a−/−, and foxl2b−/− mutants at 150 dpf were sampled to isolate total RNA. Three biological replicates were analyzed per group. The transcriptome analysis, including library construction, sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis were performed by Beijing Genomics Institute, China. Briefly, after quality assessment by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and agarose gel electrophoresis, the total RNAs were used to construct libraries. A narrow 400–450 bp size range was selected and enriched. The quantification and qualification of libraries were assessed by Agilent 2100 Bioanaylzer (Agilent Technologies) and ABI StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Scientific). The flow cells amplified from qualified libraries on cBot were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 System and 150-bp pair-end reads were generated. The assembly was performed with clean reads to produce the transcripts which were mapped to the Zv10 zebrafish genome for bioinformatic analysis. Differential expression profiles between WT and mutant samples were calculated using RSEM [RNA sequencing (RNAseq) by expectation maximization] (Li and Dewey 2011). The transcripts were classified according to the official annotation of the Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium, and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichments were performed using phyper, a function of R. Statistical analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed using a relative change of ≥2 as the threshold to judge the significance of gene expression difference. False discovery rate (FDR) was used to determine the threshold of the P-value and GO or KEGG terms (FDR ≤ 0.01) were considered significantly enriched.Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS (version 13.0) and OriginPro (version 8.0). All quantitative data were expressed as the mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses of the data were performed using an ANOVA, followed by Duncan’s multiple range test. A probability of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.The DNA sequences have been deposited at National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), accession numbers from KR232688 to KR232690. The raw data of transcriptomes have been submitted to the NCBI database (accession number: SRR4239959). See Table S2 for gene symbols, full names, RefSeq identifications, and related references. All the Supplemental Table Legends have been shown in File S2.Similar to foxl2a transcripts (OTTDART00000051092 and OTTDART00000051093) in the Vertebrate Genome Annotation database (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/vega-genome-browser), two transcript variants, named foxl2a-1 (KR232688) and foxl2a-2 (KR232689), were cloned from zebrafish ovary. Although the 5′ UTR sequences are different, they have an identical ORF (Figure 1A). The 5′ UTRs are transcribed from the first and second exon, respectively, suggesting that they arise from different transcriptional start sites. Moreover, foxl2b (KR232690) was also identified from zebrafish ovary (Figure 1B). The full-length cDNAs of foxl2a-1, foxl2a-2, and foxl2b are 1080, 1066, and 1269 bp, encoding 306, 306, and 285 amino acids, respectively. Similar to other vertebrate Foxl2 proteins, the FHD of zebrafish Foxl2a and Foxl2b are highly conserved, showing 98% amino acid identity, but their full amino acid sequences have only 64% identity (Figure S1 in File S1). Like other nonmammalian Foxl2 proteins, zebrafish Foxl2a and Foxl2b both lack glycine-rich (G), polyalanine tract (A), and proline-alanine-rich domains that are present in mammalian FOXL2 (Figure S1 in File S1). Phylogenetic analysis showed that vertebrate Foxl proteins were divided into three distinctive branches (Foxl1, Foxl2, and Foxl3). As shown in Figure 1, C and D, zebrafish Foxl2a and Foxl2b are both clustered into a Foxl2 grouping, indicating foxl2 is duplicated in the zebrafish genome (Figure 1C) with paralogs on chromosomes 15 and 2, respectively (Figure 1D). Other Foxl2-like genes are grouped with Foxl3, implying that they should be renamed as Foxl3 homologs. Although there is a highly conserved synteny within genomic regions of zebrafish, human, mouse, chicken, and frog around foxl2 genes; a complementary loss/retention pattern exists in the vicinity genes of foxl2a and foxl2b between zebrafish chromosome 15 and chromosome 2 (Figure 1D), indicating that they might undergo divergent evolution after duplication.Molecular characterization of zebrafish foxl2a and foxl2b. (A and B) Genomic structure and transcript schematics of zebrafish foxl2a and foxl2b. Exons and introns are shown by boxes and horizontal lines, respectively.

The oblique line between two genes shows their discontinuity. Gene symbols, full names, RefSeq identifications, and related references are listed in Table S2. Chr, chromosome.First, sexually dimorphic expression of foxl2a and foxl2b was observed by qRT-PCR in zebrafish mature ovaries and testes. As shown in Figure 2A, foxl2a-1, foxl2a-2, and foxl2b were all expressed in mature ovaries, whereas their expression was almost absent in mature testes. Then, we analyzed their expression levels during ovary differentiation, maturation, and maintenance. As shown in Figure 2B, foxl2a including foxl2a-1 and foxl2a-2 initiated expression early during ovary differentiation, and quickly reached peak values at 45 dpf (foxl2a-1) and 35 dpf (foxl2a-2), respectively. By contrast, foxl2b expression was relatively lower and gradually increased through the early stages of ovary differentiation from 15 to 45 dpf. Then, coinciding with diminishing expression of foxl2a-1 and foxl2a-2, foxl2b expression increased and reached a peak at 105 dpf, and then remained at a relative high level in the mature ovary and stages of oocyte maintenance (Figure 2B).Expression characterization of zebrafish foxl2a-1, foxl2a-2, and foxl2b during ovary development and maintenance. (A) Sexually dimorphic expression between mature ovary and testis. (B) Sequential and divergent expression during ovary development and maintenance from 15 to 270 dpf. The qRT-PCR quantification of gene expression was normalized to actb1. The relative expression values were first calculated against actb1 and then against that of foxl2a-1 at 25 dpf. (C and D) Ovary section in situ localization at (C) 35 dpf and (D) 105 dpf. Bars are shown at bottom-right of the images.The cellular localization and spatio-temporal distribution of foxl2a and foxl2b were assessed in ovaries at 35 and 105 dpf by in situ hybridization on tissue sections. Both foxl2a and foxl2b were expressed in follicular layer cells (FLCs) around the primary-growth oocytes (POs) in 35 dpf ovary, and foxl2a transcript signal was stronger than foxl2b (Figure 2C). At 105 dpf, foxl2a transcript was mainly localized in FLCs around POs, previtellogenic oocytes (PVOs), and vitellogenic oocytes (VOs), and its signal became very weak in mature oocytes (MOs) (Figure 2D). In contrast, foxl2b transcript was ubiquitously localized in FLCs around all oocytes (POs, PVOs, VOs, and MOs), and became stronger in MOs at 105 dpf ovary (Figure 2D). Therefore, foxl2a is expressed in early FLCs and may function early in ovary development, whereas foxl2b may function later.To explore the function of foxl2a and foxl2b in zebrafish SD and differentiation, we constructed two homozygous mutant lines, foxl2a−/− and foxl2b−/−, by using TALEN. The TALEN target sites near the translation start codon were chosen to disrupt the translation of Foxl2a and Foxl2b proteins (Figure 3, A and B). Specific primers were designed to amplify a foxl2a or foxl2b DNA fragment containing the TALEN target site and a cleavage site with BstN I or BsrD I, respectively (Figure 3, A and B). A 523-bp DNA fragment of foxl2a amplified from WT embryos was completely digested by BstN І to produce two DNA fragments (307 and 216 bp), while the fragments from TALEN F0 embryos could not be completely digested (Figure 3C). This suggested that F0 embryos were chimeric for modification of the BstN І site. Indeed, a total of eight different indels modified at the target site were found from 20 embryos (Figure 3E), and the mutation frequency in F0 founders was ∼70% (14/20). Similarly, foxl2b was also successfully disrupted by the TALEN approach (Figure 3, D and F), and the mutation rate was 66.7% (8/12) in the F0 founders (Figure 3F).Establishment of foxl2a and foxl2b knockout mutant lines by TALEN. (A and B) The TALEN target sites of zebrafish (A) foxl2a and (B) foxl2b. The coding and untranslated exon regions are depicted as solid and open boxes, respectively. The left and right TALEN binding sites are indicated by underlining.

(G) Transcription-level confirmation of foxl2a and foxl2b mutants by RT-PCR. The detected primers are shown on the left, and primer P2 is specific for the deleted sequences. The actb1 was used as control. F, forward; R, reverse; M, marker.Subsequently, the remaining F0 embryos were raised to adulthood and crossed with WT zebrafish. PCR amplification and digestion were done with gDNA of F1 embryos to test for germ line transmission of induced lesions. Since the 5-bp deletion (Δ5) in foxl2a leads to a frameshift, it was chosen to be crossed with WT zebrafish to obtain F1 offspring. Sibling F1 male and female individuals carrying the same mutation were crossed with each other to produce homozygous F2 mutants (foxl2a−/−) whose genotypes were also confirmed by PCR amplification and digestion. The PCR-amplified fragment from homozygous foxl2a−/− F2 mutants could not be digested by BstN І (Figure 3C). Similarly, a 23-bp deletion (Δ23) in foxl2b leading to frameshifting of the coding sequence was also selected to successfully establish the foxl2b mutant line (foxl2b−/−) (Figure 3, D and F). To confirm successful deletion in foxl2a and foxl2b genes, RT-PCR analyses were performed to ensure no expression of functional transcripts. Indeed, no WT transcripts were detected in the mutant ovaries by using the specific primers over the deleted sequences of foxl2a−/− (Δ5) and foxl2b−/− (Δ23) (Figure 3G).To explore the function of foxl2a and exclude the effects of environmental factors on zebrafish SD and differentiation, we raised to adulthood 30 homozygous foxl2a−/− F3 individuals and 30 control individuals together in one aquarium with 6 replicates. Zebrafish females began to spawn around 3 months after hatching in our aquarium system. The gross morphology and histology of the ovaries were analyzed both in the controls (WT) and homozygous mutants (foxl2a−/−). It was difficult to identify mutants by body size and shape (Figure 4), so we randomly sampled individuals (including mutants and controls) at different ages to identify genotype and sex. As shown in Figure S2 in File S1, foxl2a−/− mutants and controls both had a normal 1:1 sex ratio. At 35 dpf, zebrafish gonads could be distinguished as either an ovary or a testis by morphology under dissection microscope. Histological analyses showed that the gonads of foxl2a−/− female mutants contained numerous POs, similar to controls (Figure S3 in File S1). At 60 dpf, some oocytes of both foxl2a−/− mutants and controls started to enter the PVO and VO stage (Figure S3 in File S1). This indicates that initial ovarian differentiation and oocyte development occur normally in foxl2a−/− mutants. At 105 dpf when adult fishes were ready for spawning, the ovaries from foxl2a−/− mutants and controls both contained large numbers of POs, PVOs, VOs, and MOs (Figure 4A). The results indicate that foxl2a−/− female mutants exhibit normal ovarian differentiation and oocyte development.Disruption of foxl2a leads to similar POF in adult females. (A–D) Gross morphology, anatomical, and histological examination of adult ovaries in WT controls and foxl2a mutants (foxl2a−/−) were analyzed at (A) 105 dpf (n = 12), (B) 150 dpf (n = 6), (C) 180 dpf (n = 3), and (D) 270 dpf (n = 6). (E) GSI values in control females and foxl2a mutant females. Data are presented as mean ± SEM * P ≤ 0.05 (Duncan’s multiple range test). Bars are shown at bottom right of the images. ♀, female; ♂, male.Considering POF in some human BPES patients with FOXL2 mutation, we continued to raise foxl2a−/− mutants and controls together after spawning, and examined the status of ovaries during later adult life. Because ovulation occurs asynchronously, zebrafish can spawn continuously after maturation. Oocytes of both foxl2a−/− mutants and controls were recruited into maturation and ovulated again at 150 dpf (Figure 4B). In contrast to controls, for which all females spawned again, ∼10 and 60% of foxl2a−/− female mutants with enlarged abdomens failed to spawn again at 180 and 270 dpf, respectively. Dissection showed that the ovaries of foxl2a−/− mutants became white at 180 dpf, and a large number of somatic cells filled in the lobules of ovarian tissues (Figure 4C). No oocytes at the previtellogenic and vitellogenic stages were observed, and only some degenerating primary-growth oocytes (DPOs) and degenerating oocytes (DOs) existed in the edges of each lobule (Figure 4C). Along with oocyte failure, the ovaries of foxl2a−/− mutants became transparent and aggravated, and only a few DPOs and vestiges of DOs were retained in lobules full of proliferating somatic cells (Figure 4D). In contrast, control individuals could persistently spawn, and the ovaries still contained POs, PVOs, VOs and MOs at 180 and 270 dpf (Figure 4, C and D). Although equal GSI values were observed among all the analyzed females at 105 and 150 dpf, the GSI values of foxl2a−/− females were much lower than those of WT females at 180 and 270 dpf (Figure 4E) (P < 0.05). The accelerated ovarian aging and oocyte failure in foxl2a−/− mutants are very similar to POF in human patients (Pal and Santoro 2002), suggesting that zebrafish foxl2a might also play a similar role in regulating ovarian senescence like its homologous gene in humans.Similarly, we also raised 30 homozygous foxl2b−/− F3 individuals and 30 control individuals together in one aquarium with six repeats. Foxl2b−/− mutants and controls both had normal 1:1 sex ratios from 35 to 150 dpf (Figure S2 in File S1). In contrast to control females that all spawned again, ∼20 and 70% of foxl2b−/− female mutants failed to spawn again at 180 and 270 dpf, respectively (Figure S2 in File S1 and Figure 5). In addition, the secondary sexual characteristics of these foxl2b−/− female individuals progressively transformed from those of males to females. At 105 and 150 dpf, these females still manifested typical secondary feminine characteristics, having a round and bluish body with a large visible urogenital papilla and an indistinct anal fin coloration (Figure 5, A and B). From 180 dpf, some foxl2b−/− females exhibited mixed secondary sexual characteristics, including a slim and reddish body, an anal fin with distinct markings and a feminine urogenital papilla (Figure S4C in File S1). This implies that the homozygous foxl2b−/− female mutants undergo sex change after maturation. To further investigate the sex in foxl2b−/− females, the ovaries were sectioned for histological analyses. The ovaries of these mutants became transparent or white and exhibited partial sex reversal with different proportions of degenerating ovarian tissue and newborn testicular structure (Figure 5, C and D). At 180 dpf, lobules contained numerous somatic cells, with DPOs and vestiges of DOs scattered in the early transitional gonads (Figure 5, C and E). Along with the process of sex reversal, some similar spermatogenic cysts (SCs) containing spermatogonia (SG), spermatocytes (SPs), and spermatids emerged at 270 dpf, and a few of vestiges of DOs were still retained in the lobules (Figure 5, D and F). However, the female foxl2b−/− mutants did not completely change to fertile males, and gradually died off after 270 dpf, likely owing to hyperplasia of testicular and kidney tissues. Meanwhile, the GSI values of foxl2b−/− females in the process of sex reversal decreased more sharply than those of WT females from 180 to 270 dpf (Figure 5G) (P < 0.05). Therefore, foxl2b might play different roles in regulating ovary development and maintenance as compared to foxl2a.Partial sex reversal toward testicular tissue in foxl2b-deficient adult females. (A–F) Gross morphology, anatomical, and histological examination of adult ovaries in controls (WT) and foxl2b mutants (foxl2b−/−) were analyzed at (A) 105 dpf (n = 13), (B) 150 dpf (n = 6), (C) 180 dpf (n = 5), and (D) 270 dpf (n = 7). Higher magnifications of the boxed areas in (C) and (D) are shown in (E) and (F). (G) GSI values in control females and foxl2b mutant females. Data are presented as mean ± SEM * P ≤ 0.05 (Duncan’s multiple range test). ♂, female; ♀, male; SD, spermatid. Bars are shown at bottom right of the images.To reveal the pathways or genes influenced early by foxl2a or foxl2b deficiency, we performed comparative transcriptome analyses to investigate DEGs between initial transformation ovaries in foxl2a−/− mutants, or foxl2b−/− mutants and normal ovaries at the same age. In mice, Foxl2 cooperates with estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) to repress Sox9 expression (Uhlenhaut et al. 2009). Before transcriptome analyses, we first tested whether this pathway was conserved in zebrafish by evaluating sox9a expression changes at 150 dpf, because significant changes in gonad histology had occurred at 180 dpf, even though no apparent abnormalities were observed at 150 dpf (Figure 4B and Figure 5B). Indeed, the expression of sox9a was up-regulated both in foxl2a−/− and foxl2b−/− mutant ovaries at 150 dpf (Figure S5 in File S1), indicating that the gonadal transformation process had already been initiated. Therefore, the ovary at 150 dpf is suitable for performing RNAseq analysis. After filtration to remove the reads with low quality or adaptors, ∼30,000,000 clean reads in each sample were obtained and assembled into ∼23,000 transcripts (Table S3). In comparison with control ovaries, a total of 6005 and 6253 DEGs were respectively revealed in foxl2a−/− and foxl2b−/− ovaries at 150 dpf (Table S4), in which 1220 and 1314 DEGs were both upregulated or downregulated in foxl2a−/− and foxl2b−/− mutant ovaries (Figure S6A in File S1 and Table S4). The pathway with most annotated unigenes of commonly upregulated DEGs in KEGG was the “TNF signaling pathway,” followed by “cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction” (Figure S6B in File S1 and Table S5), indicating the pathways involved in apoptosis or necroptosis were activated in both foxl2a−/− and foxl2b−/− mutant ovaries. In contrast, three pathways in “lipid metabolism” were found in the top 10 enriched KEGG pathways of commonly downregulated DEGs, implying the lipid synthesis or secretion was suppressed in both foxl2a−/− and foxl2b−/− mutant ovaries compared to control ovaries (Figure S6C in File S1 and Table S5).To reveal differential regulation by foxl2a and foxl2b, the DEGs specifically changed in foxl2a−/− and foxl2b−/− mutant ovaries were respectively analyzed. As shown in Figure S6A in File S1, a total of 4471 and 3719 unigenes changed their expression levels in foxl2a−/− and foxl2b−/− mutant ovaries compared to control ovaries. The KEGG mapping analysis showed the differentially enriched pathways between these DEGs (Figure S6, D–G, in File S1; Table S5). Among the top 20 enriched pathways, only one pathway (“neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction”) was shared between specifically upregulated DEGs from foxl2a−/− and foxl2b−/− mutant ovaries. Significantly, several important gonadal development-related genes (e.g., sox9a, wt1, gata4, sox3, and nr5a2) and foxl2b were specifically upregulated in foxl2a−/− mutant ovaries, while dmrt1 and sox9b were upregulated in foxl2b−/− mutant ovaries (Table S4).In consideration of the significant gonad transition that occurred in foxl2a−/− or foxl2b−/− female mutants (Figure 4 and Figure 5), we selected several genes involved in gonadal development (Table S4, Table S5, and Figure 6A) to further confirm their dynamic expression changes by using qRT-PCR analyses in transforming gonads from 105 to 270 dpf (Figure 6, B–N). This analysis revealed differential modulation of gene expression between foxl2a−/−/WT and foxl2b−/−/WT ovaries from 105 to 270 dpf. As expected, sox9a expression started to rise after the sexual maturity in foxl2a−/− female mutants at 105 dpf, and gradually increased up to 12-fold at 270 dpf. In contrast, the expression of sox9a rose at 150 dpf and increased up to 92-fold in foxl2b−/− female mutants against that of control ovaries at 270 dpf (Figure 6B). As a downstream target of sox9a, amh expression started to rise after sox9a increase (150 dpf) and reached a peak with a 10-fold increase at 180 dpf in foxl2a−/− mutants, while it maintained a low expression level until 180 dpf and increased dramatically (2255-fold) in expression at 270 dpf in foxl2b−/− female mutants (Figure 6C). cyp19a1a gradually decreased in abundance in both foxl2a−/− and foxl2b−/− female mutants, but the downward trend was more violent in latter (Figure 6D). Consistent with oocyte apoptosis and degeneration in foxl2a−/− and foxl2b−/− mutants, the expression of apoptosis-related genes casp8 and tnfrsf1a gradually increased from 105 dpf. These data support the possibility that the upregulation of sox9a-amh/cyp19a1a signaling triggers oocyte apoptosis and degeneration in both female foxl2a−/− mutants and foxl2b−/− mutants. Interestingly, the dynamic expression changes in foxl2b−/− mutants showed a delayed pattern compared to foxl2a−/− mutants (Figure 6, B–F), suggesting a transition in functional requirements from foxl2a to foxl2b at later stages.Transcriptome profiling changes of gonadal development-related genes in ovaries of foxl2a−/− and foxl2b−/− mutants. (A) Relatively transcribed changes of several kinds of gonadal development-related genes between foxl2a−/− and WT ovaries or foxl2b−/− and WT ovaries at 150 dpf. (B–N) Relative expression qRT-PCR detection of the indicated genes in WT, foxl2a−/−, and foxl2b−/− ovaries from 105 to 270 dpf (n = 3). The qRT-PCR quantification of each gene expression is normalized to actb1, and the data are presented as mean ± SEM * P ≤ 0.05 (Duncan’s multiple range test).Compared to that in corresponding control ovaries, testis differentiation-related genes, such as dmrt1, wt1a, gata4, nr5a2, and nr5a5, maintained a moderately increased expression in ovaries of foxl2a−/− mutants, while their expression in foxl2b−/− mutants increased dramatically from dozens to several 100-fold at 270 dpf (Figure 6, G–K), consistent with the sex change that occurred in foxl2b−/− mutants (Figure 5). Although nr5a1b expression was not significantly different in ovaries between the female controls and foxl2a−/− mutants, it also increased by ∼69-fold at 270 dpf in the ovotestis of foxl2b−/− mutants (Figure 6L). These results suggest that foxl2a and foxl2b might play some divergent roles in regulating ovary development and maintenance, where foxl2b is specific for inhibiting testis development.Besides the degeneration of oocytes, the massive increase of somatic cells (Figure 4, C and D) indicates that a POF might have occurred in foxl2a-deficient female zebrafish. Both germ cell marker genes piwil1 and dazl expression levels in foxl2a−/− mutant ovaries were equal to those of control ovaries at 105 and 150 dpf. However, they sharply decreased in abundance to 11 and 24% at 270 dpf, respectively (Figure 6, M and N), indicating that the germ cells largely reduce in foxl2a−/− mutant ovaries from 180 dpf. In contrast, piwil1 and dazl expression in foxl2b−/− female mutants increased in ovotestis at 270 dpf (Figure 6, M and N). This is probably due to a large number of spermatogenic cysts that contain male germ cells generated during gonad transformation from ovary to testis. Additionally, nine cytochrome P450 (cyp) genes also showed differential modulation of gene expression between foxl2a−/−/WT and foxl2b−/−/WT ovaries from 105 to 270 dpf (Figure 7), indicating that both foxl2a and foxl2b regulate the steroidogenesis in zebrafish gonads, and their effects on steroid homeostasis differ.Transcriptome profiling changes of cyp genes in the ovaries of foxl2a−/− and foxl2b−/− mutants. (A) Relatively transcribed changes of nine cyp genes between foxl2a−/− and WT ovaries or foxl2b−/− and WT ovaries at 150 dpf. (B–J) Relative expression qRT-PCR detection of nine cyp genes in WT, foxl2a−/−, and foxl2b−/− ovaries from 105 to 270 dpf (n = 3). The qRT-PCR quantification of each gene expression is normalized to actb1, and the data are presented as mean ± SEM * P ≤ 0.05 (Duncan’s multiple range test).Owing to the high identity in amino acid sequence and the sequential and divergent expression between foxl2a and foxl2b, we speculated that their functions would be compensatory in some ways. To address this, zebrafish homozygous foxl2a/foxl2b F2 double mutants (foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/−) carrying Δ5 in foxl2a and Δ23 in foxl2b were created. One-cell embryos were co-injected as described above with the two TALEN mRNAs which caused foxl2a mutation or foxl2b mutation, respectively. The heterozygous foxl2a+/−/foxl2b+/− double mutant individuals were chosen to cross with each other. In the examined 11 homozygous double mutant individuals with foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/− genotype from the crossing, interestingly, only mature males with normal testis (Figure S7 in File S1) were found, whereas no adult females were observed. To acquire more homozygous foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/− mutants, we raised offspring of foxl2a−/−/foxl2b+/− (female) crossed with foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/− (male) in one aquarium. At 105 dpf, a total of 45 individuals were randomly sampled to examine their genotypes and gonads, and 24 individuals were identified as homozygous foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/−. In comparison with normal gonads in foxl2a−/−/foxl2b+/− female and male adults (11 females and 10 males) (Figure 8A), again, no mature females with normal ovaries were observed. Only males were detected from the 24 homozygous foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/− adults, of which three individuals showed dual secondary sexual characteristics, such as feminine urogenital papilla and masculine anal fin (Figure S2 and Figure S4D in File S1), and abnormal ovotestis with DPOs and DOs as well as numerous SCs containing SG, SPs, and spermatids (Figure 8B). Another 21 individuals were found to have normal secondary masculine characteristics, including a nonvisible papillae, a slim and reddish body, and a big anal fin with distinct markings (Figure S4D in File S1), and normally developed testis full of SG, SPs and spermatids (Figure 8B). GSI values of homozygous foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/− females with sex reversal characteristics were much lower than those of heterozygous foxl2a−/−/foxl2b+/− females at 105 dpf (Figure 8C) (P < 0.05).Complete sex reversal in homozygous foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/− females. (A and B) Gross morphology, anatomical, and gonadal histology examination of (A) heterozygous double mutants (foxl2a−/−/foxl2b+/−) (n = 13) and (B) homozygous double mutants (foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/−) (n = 3) at 105 dpf. (C) GSI in foxl2a−/−/foxl2b+/− and foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/− mutants at 105 dpf. Data are presented as mean ± SEM * P ≤ 0.05 (Duncan’s multiple range test). (D) Gonadal development status of homozygous foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/− individuals from young fishes to adults at 35, 40, 50, 60, 105, and 150 dpf. (E) Gonadal histology examination of heterozygous double mutants (foxl2a−/−/foxl2b+/−) and homozygous double mutants (foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/−) at 35 dpf (n = 7), 40 dpf (n = 3), 50 dpf (n = 7), and 60 dpf (n = 9). ♀, females; ♂, males; CV, cavity; SD, spermatid. Bars are shown at bottom right of the images.To investigate when foxl2a/foxl2b deficiency affects ovary development and leads to sex reversal, we checked the gonadal development status of homozygous foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/− individuals from young to adults at 35, 40, 50, 60, 105, and 150 dpf. As shown in Figure S2 in File S1 and Figure 8D, the ratios of ovary, ovotestis, and testis in foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/− mutants were very different, changing from seven ovaries:eight testes (∼50%) at 35 dpf to 0 ovaries:15 testes (100% testes), and ∼13–38% of ovotestes existed from 40 to 105 dpf. Moreover, we examined the gonadal histology of these sex reversal individuals from 35, 40, 50, and 60 dpf. As shown in Figure 8E, in comparison with normal ovaries with POs, PVOs, and VOs in heterozygous double mutant (foxl2a−/−/foxl2b+/−) females, the female individuals in homozygous foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/− mutants began to exhibit extensive oocyte degeneration and initiative sex reversal early from 40 dpf, even though they showed normal ovary differentiation at 35 dpf. At 35 dpf, numerous POs were destined for primitive ovaries, while apoptosis seemed to occur rapidly at 40 dpf, because there were many DPOs and cavities in the gonad tissues. Along with oocyte apoptosis and degeneration from 50 to 60 dpf, testicular tissues began to differentiate and numerously proliferated spermatogenic cells including SG, SPs, and spermatids filled the differentiated testes. After 60 dpf, it became increasingly difficult to identify female individuals, and only three individuals with secondary feminine characteristics and ovaries were discovered (Figure 8D and Figure S2 in File S1). At 150 dpf, all of the homozygous foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/− individuals examined had histologically normal testes (Figure 8D and Figure S2 in File S1), and were able to produce normal sperm and fertilize eggs. These data indicate that simultaneous disruption of foxl2a and foxl2b leads to complete sex reversal, and sex reversal occurs earlier in foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/− mutants than in foxl2b−/− mutants. Therefore, the roles of foxl2a and foxl2b might be compensatory in zebrafish ovary development and maintenance.We also examined secondary sexual characteristics and testis development status of male foxl2a−/−, foxl2b−/−, and foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/− mutants at 35, 60, and 105 dpf. No significant abnormality in secondary sexual characteristics, testis differentiation and development, or spermatogenesis were observed in the males of three mutants. Similar to controls, some oocyte-like germ cells began to undergo apoptosis as demonstrated by dark-stained cytoplasm, and SCs containing SPs scattered in the gonadal tissues at 35 dpf. At 60 and 105 dpf, the male germ cells at all spermatogenic stages filled the lobules, and numerous free spermatozoa congregated into the lumen of all individuals of the three male mutants (Figure S7 in File S1). Furthermore, all male mutants were fertile because they all successfully spawned with females to produce normal offspring. Therefore, consistent with their sexually dimorphic expression, both foxl2a and foxl2b function specifically in the female gonad.To test the molecular basis of the sex reversal that occurred in homozygous foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/− mutants, we examined the expression of gonad-related genes selected as above in the gonads from foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/− mutants at 60 dpf, which were classified into three stages: ovary, ovotestis, and testis. As expected, sox9a, amh, dmrt1, and other genes involved in the male development pathway all increased by several dozen- or even several 100-fold in ovotestis and testis compared to those in ovaries (Figure 9, A, B, and F–K); while ovary-related genes, such as cyp19a1a and cyp11a1, decreased significantly in ovotestis and were hardly detected in testis (Figure 9, C and N). Expression of all other cyp genes examined; as well as tnfrsf1a, caspase-8, piwil1, and dazl (Figure 9, D, E, L, and M); increased sharply in ovotestis and testis compared to those in ovaries (Figure 9, O–V). The altered expression levels in homozygous foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/− mutants were very similar to those of foxl2b−/− mutants at 270 dpf, implying that foxl2a deficiency enhances sex reversal caused by foxl2b knockout, whereas single foxl2a mutation results in different defects.Foxl2a and foxl2b cooperatively regulate ovary differentiation and maintenance in zebrafish. (A–V) Relative expression qRT-PCR detection of the indicated genes in ovary (O), ovotestis (O/T), and testis (T) of homozygous double mutants (foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/−) at 60 dpf (n = 3). Gene names are indicated at the top. (W–Y) Relative expression qRT-PCR detection of (W) foxl2a-1, (X) foxl2a-2, and (Y) foxl2b in the ovaries of WT and foxl2b mutants (foxl2b−/−) or foxl2a mutants (foxl2a−/−) from 35 to 270 dpf, respectively (n = 3). The qRT-PCR quantification of each gene expression is normalized to actb1, and the data are presented as mean ± SEM * P ≤ 0.05 (Duncan’s multiple range test).To test whether the functions of foxl2a and foxl2b are compensative in ovary development and maintenance, we assessed the expression changes of foxl2a in foxl2b−/− mutants and vice versa. Interestingly, the mRNA expression levels of both foxl2a-1 and foxl2a-2 were upregulated in the gonads of foxl2b−/− mutants before 180 dpf (Figure 9, W and X), and the reverse was also true (Figure 9Y). It seems that foxl2a and foxl2b can increase in expression to compensate for reduced expression at the other locus, eventually causing normal ovary development in both mutant backgrounds. However, foxl2a and foxl2b transcripts started to decrease in abundance from 180 dpf, when the mutants underwent POF or sex reversal. The pathological changes in the ovary might reduce or destroy the pathways involved in female gonad maintenance. This also suggests that the compensation between foxl2a and foxl2b in this process is partly divergent, causing the different phenotypes in two single mutants. Taken together, these results indicate that foxl2a and foxl2b cooperatively regulate zebrafish ovary differentiation and maintenance, whereas foxl2b plays more specific roles in maintaining female identity and preventing male transformation.Although SD and differentiation have been well studied in mammals and several sex-determining genes have been identified from different teleost species, this process is still a complicated affair in zebrafish (Liew and Orban 2013; Nagabhushana and Mishra 2016). Here we have revealed a sequential and divergent expression pattern between two zebrafish foxl2 homologs, foxl2a and foxl2b, during oogenesis. Via histological and transcriptomic analyses of the foxl2a−/− and foxl2b−/− mutants, we propose a hypothesized model in which foxl2a and foxl2b cooperatively regulate zebrafish ovary differentiation and maintenance. As shown in Figure 10, unlike normal testis development, ovary development and oogenesis are significantly affected by loss of foxl2a, foxl2b, or both genes. Germ cell marker loci piwil1 and dazl are sharply downregulated and the sox9a-amh/cyp19a1a signaling pathway and foxl2b are upregulated, which thereby results in POF in female foxl2a−/− mutants. In contrast to expression changes in foxl2a−/− premature ovaries, some testis differentiation and androgen-producing genes, such as dmrt1, sox9, amh, wt1a, gata4, nr5a2, nr5a5, nr5a1b, cyp17a, and cyp11a2 are upregulated in female foxl2b−/− mutants and trigger partial sex reversal, although foxl2a expression increases. In homozygous foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/− females, a complete sex reversal occurs early, and numerous genes in the testis development pathway are sharply activated to lead to complete sex reversal and formation of ovotestis and testis.A hypothesized diagram for cooperative regulation between foxl2a and foxl2b in ovary development and maintenance of zebrafish. Different gonad development stages; expression level changes of foxl2a-1, foxl2a-2, and foxl2b; different status gonads including normal testis, normal ovary, premature ovary, and ovotestis; different germ cells and gonad-related somatic cells; different gonadal development-related genes; and their upregulation and downregulation expression are indicated in detail. Red ↑, upregulation; blue ↓, downregulation.Consistent with other teleosts (Caulier et al. 2015), zebrafish foxl2a1/2 and foxl2b all showed sexual dimorphism. Zebrafish foxl2a transcripts are mainly expressed in the ovary at 35 dpf and decline while maturation proceeds. In mice, Foxl2 is expressed initially at 12.5 days postconception, and occurs in the granulosa cells of early follicles but gradually reduces as oocytes proceed to maturation (Schmidt 2004; Nakamoto et al. 2006). Foxl2 is also highly expressed in Nile tilapia XX gonads as early as 5 days after hatching (dah), increases linearly until 35 dah, and remains high at 70 dah (Ijiri et al. 2008). However, foxl2b increases from immature stages and peaks at the mature and spawning stage (Figure 10), similar to Foxl2 in chicken (Govoroun et al. 2004), Korean rockfish (Mu et al. 2013), and African sharptooth catfish (Sridevi and Senthilkumaran 2011). The sequential and divergent expression patterns of zebrafish foxl2a and foxl2b during oogenesis (Figure 10) indicate that foxl2a and foxl2b may have undergone subfunctionalization after their divergence.The role of Foxl2 is complicated because of the disparate effects in humans and other mammals, such as mouse and goat (Ottolenghi et al. 2007). Its functions in development were first suggested by studying BPES, which is characterized by eyelid/forehead anomalies associated with POF, an early loss of normal ovarian function (Crisponi et al. 2001; De Baere et al. 2003; Meduri et al. 2010). Foxl2−/− mice showed craniofacial and eyelid defects, a complete failure of follicle formation, and partial sex reversal in females (Schmidt 2004; Uda et al. 2004; Ottolenghi 2005; Ottolenghi et al. 2007). Conditional loss of Foxl2 in the adult ovary resulted in autonomous reprogramming of oocyte-supporting granulosa cells into testis-specific Sertoli-like cells (Uhlenhaut et al. 2009). In goats, FOXL2 mutation led to the polled intersex syndrome, which associated polledness and XX female-to-male sex reversal in a recessive manner (Pailhoux et al. 2001). In our study, zebrafish homozygous foxl2a−/− F3 females showed normal ovarian differentiation and growth at the onset of sexual maturity, but ∼60% of foxl2a−/− females exhibited ovarian histological changes at 270 dpf, with the degeneration of ovarian tissue, presence of atretic follicles, reduction of germ cells, and proliferation of somatic cells (Figure 4 and Figure S2 in File S1), similar to the ovarian senescence that occurred in the 18-month-old female zebrafish (Turola et al. 2015). However, no WT zebrafish exhibited ovarian senescence before 270 dpf, indicating that ovarian senescence was promoted in the foxl2a−/− mutants. The accelerated ovarian aging phenotype in foxl2a−/− mutants is reminiscent of human BPES. Meanwhile, disruption of zebrafish foxl2b led to partial sex reversal from female to male after spawning a few times (Figure 5), similar to the case in mouse and goat. Furthermore, the expression of genes related to gonad development was also different in foxl2a−/− and foxl2b−/− mutants (Figure 6, Figure 7, and Table S4). Therefore, zebrafish foxl2a and foxl2b have evolved functional divergence. On the other hand, the complete sex reversal (Figure 8) and robust increasing expression of testicular differentiation genes occurred earlier (Figure 9) in foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/− double female mutants than those in any single mutants, suggesting the compensation and redundancy between foxl2a and foxl2b. Indeed, the compensation to a deficiency in either gene was not only observed in the transcriptome profiling comparisons (Table S4), but also confirmed by qRT-PCR (Figure 9, W–Y). Taken together, foxl2a and foxl2b work differentially and cooperate to manipulate zebrafish ovary differentiation and maintenance.Foxl2 and Sox9, as the yin and yang of sex maintenance, antagonize each other’s actions in the establishment and maintenance of granulosa cells and Sertoli cells (Uhlenhaut et al. 2009). In this case, a significant increase of sox9a transcript takes place both in foxl2a−/− and foxl2b−/− mutated ovaries at 150 dpf (Figure 6, A and B, and Table S4), although no apparent abnormalities of ovarian morphology and histology were observed (Figure 4B). The upregulation of sox9a in foxl2a−/− and foxl2b−/− mutated ovaries suggests that zebrafish sox9a transcription might be directly repressed by Foxl2s in the ovary, similar to mouse. A cis-regulatory element for testis-specific Sox9 expression (TESCO) has been identified in mouse Sox9 (Sekido and Lovell-Badge 2008) and proven to be negatively modulated by FOXL2 (Uhlenhaut et al. 2009). However, the well-conserved 1.4-kb TESCO sequence was only found in placental mammals, not in chicken, Fugu, or zebrafish (Sekido and Lovell-Badge 2008). Further analyses revealed that a 180-bp evolutionarily conserved region (ECR) within the SOX9 testis enhancer containing the conserved FHD binding site was identified in chicken, lizard, and frog, but not in fish (Bagheri-Fam et al. 2010). After searching the zebrafish draft genome by using frog ECR as the query, a 180-bp sequence showing a 43% identity to frog ECR was found in the 68.1 kb upstream of the zebrafish sox9a gene, where seven conserved FHD binding sites occured. This suggests that zebrafish Foxl2s might also inhibit the testis-differentiation program, mainly through repressing sox9a as occurs in mouse (Uhlenhaut et al. 2009). Interestingly, sox9a expression changes corresponding to the disruption of foxl2a and foxl2b are not the same (Figure 6B), implying that a subtle differential regulatory mechanism remains for further investigation in zebrafish. During mammalian male fetal sex differentiation, Sox9 activates the expression of Amh (de Santa Barbara et al. 1998), which induces the degeneration of Müllerian ducts (Behringer et al. 1994) and inhibits Cyp19a1 expression (Rouiller-Fabre et al. 1998). Along with the upregulation of sox9a, amh increased in expression while cyp19a1a decreased in abundance in all three zebrafish mutant ovaries (Figure 6, B–D, and Figure 9, A–C), implying that a sox9a-amh/cyp19a1a pathway should be highly conserved in vertebrates.Dmrt1 is a central regulator in vertebrate testis determination and differentiation (Xia et al. 2007; Matson and Zarkower 2012; Li et al. 2014). It is required for mammalian postnatal testis differentiation (Raymond et al. 2000), and its homologous genes were identified as SD genes in chicken (Smith et al. 2009), X. laevis (Yoshimoto et al. 2008), and medaka (Matsuda et al. 2002). In conditional Foxl2 deletion mice ovotestis, Dmrt1 is one of the most upregulated genes, indicating that FOXL2 may directly repress Dmrt1 transcription (Uhlenhaut et al. 2009). Interestingly, sox9a and dmrt1 exhibited differentially dynamic expression patterns between foxl2a−/−/WT and foxl2b−/−/WT ovaries (Figure 6, B and G). In accordance with no sex reversal individuals observed in foxl2a−/− mutants, dmrt1 only slightly increased in expression at 270 dpf. However, dmrt1 and other testicular differentiation genes, such as sox9a (Chiang et al. 2001), amh (Schulz et al. 2001), wt1a (Hammes et al. 2001), gata4 (Tevosian et al. 2002), nr5a2, nr5a5, and nr5a1b (Luo et al. 1994; Von Hofsten et al. 2005a,b), were all robustly upregulated in ovotestis of foxl2b−/− mutants along with sex reversal (Figure 6, B, C, and G–L), which indicated that foxl2b might play a more dominant role in suppressing testis-differentiation signaling than foxl2a. Although many key players, such as foxl2a, sox9, amh, dmrt1, and cyp19a1, show sexually dimorphic expression in zebrafish, the interactions within the proposed transcriptional network are unclear. The establishments of the foxl2a−/−, foxl2b−/−, and foxl2a−/−/foxl2b−/− mutants in this study will provide a model to definitively clarify the regulatory interactions among these factors.The CYP enzymes catalyze oxidation reactions and have diverse functions in vertebrates. It is well known that some cyp family members play essential roles in steroidogenesis, including estrogen production (Stoilov 2001; Payne and Hales 2004; Chang et al. 2005; Baldwin et al. 2009; Huang et al. 2009; Heule et al. 2014). Many studies have been done to reveal the relevance of foxl2, aromatase, and sex hormones in the teleost brain-pituitary-gonad axis, in which foxl2 was found to regulate estrogen synthesis via transcriptional regulation of cyp19 (Baron 2004; Wang et al. 2007; Navarro-Martín et al. 2011; Sridevi et al. 2012; Crespo et al. 2013), and in turn, the ovarian foxl2 was upregulated by estrogen treatment (Baron 2004; Liu et al. 2007; Wu et al. 2008; Jiang et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2012). Zebrafish have a total of 94 cyp genes (Goldstone et al. 2010), in which 59 cyp genes were identified from transcriptome files (Table S4) and 9 cyp genes showing dynamic expression changes in three mutants were confirmed by qRT-PCR (Figure 7 and Figure 9). The differential effects of foxl2a and foxl2b on gonadal steroidogenesis need further investigation to determine the regulatory mechanisms between foxl2s and cyps.Zebrafish male development undergoes a transformation of juvenile ovary to testis in adolescence (Uchida et al. 2002; Maack and Segner 2003). During this process, the sox9a-amh/cyp19a1a pathway linked to MAPK-p53 signaling precedes oocyte apoptosis and degeneration, and the expression of sox9a increased in the transforming gonads activates stromal cells and increases extracellular matrix (ECM) production (Sun et al. 2013). Similarly, we observed the DOs surrounded by gonadal matrix and a massive increase of somatic cells in the three mutants (Figure 4, Figure 5, and Figure 8). The comparative transcriptome analyses revealed that the TNF signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and “ECM-receptor interaction” pathways were enriched in both foxl2a−/−/WT and foxl2b−/−/WT ovaries (Table S5). Meanwhile, the DOs were dissociated from adjacent cells with a marked vacuolation in the three female mutants (Figure 4, Figure 5, and Figure 8), implying that the oocytes and follicle cells lost their tight junctions with adjacent cells. Consistent with these changes, the top 30 pathways in both foxl2a−/−/WT and foxl2b−/−/WT ovaries include several pathways involved in cell adhesion, such as cell adhesion molecules, focal adhesion, gap junction, and regulation of actin cytoskeleton (Table S5).In conclusion, this study established foxl2a knockout, foxl2b knockout, and double knockout zebrafish and revealed POF, partial sex reversal, and complete sex reversal in the three mutants, respectively. Based on the comparative transcriptome analyses and dynamic expression patterns of DEGs, we propose that foxl2a and foxl2b cooperate with each other to regulate zebrafish ovary differentiation and maintenance, and that foxl2b plays a dominant role in preventing the ovary from differentiating as testis. In addition, these foxl2-related mutants also provide some model systems to study human POF and the mechanism determining fish sex.We are grateful to Wenhua Li and Chenyan Mou for helping to construct the transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) plasmids and to screen the mutants.

Michael Roberts, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, and approved December 20, 2016 (received for review June 13, 2016)Fish exhibit remarkable sexual plasticity. However, the underlying mechanism of heat-induced sex reversal is still unclear. Here we first established the conditions for heat-induced reprogramming of sexual phenotypes in zebrafish through sex ratio analysis and gonad transcriptomics. Sex ratio response to heat was family-specific and resulted in masculinization. We observed two heat-induced gonadal transcriptomic profiles per sex in adults, among them neomales and, strikingly, females with an ovary but a “male-like” transcriptome. The latter indicates major transcriptomic reprogramming with preserved organ structure, an interesting observation in vertebrates. In all heat-treated juveniles, we also observed a male-like transcriptome. Overall, this study reveals novel lasting thermal effects on fish gonads, with practical implications for studying the effects of global warming in natural populations.Understanding environmental influences on sex ratios is important for the study of the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms and for evaluating the effects of global warming and chemical pollution. Fishes exhibit sexual plasticity, but the underlying mechanisms of environmental effects on their reproduction are unclear even in the well-established teleost research model, the zebrafish. Here we established the conditions to study the effects of elevated temperature on zebrafish sex. We showed that sex ratio response to elevated temperature is family-specific and typically leads to masculinization (female-to-male sex reversal), resulting in neomales. These results uncovered genotype-by-environment interactions that support a polygenic sex determination system in domesticated (laboratory) zebrafish. We found that some heat-treated fish had gene expression profiles similar to untreated controls of the same sex, indicating that they were resistant to thermal effects. Further, most neomales had gonadal transcriptomes similar to that of regular males. Strikingly, we discovered heat-treated females that displayed a normal ovarian phenotype but with a “male-like” gonadal transcriptome. Such major transcriptomic reprogramming with preserved organ structure has never been reported. Juveniles were also found to have a male-like transcriptome shortly after exposure to heat. These findings were validated by analyzing the expression of genes and signaling pathways associated with sex differentiation. Our results revealed a lasting thermal effect on zebrafish gonads, suggesting new avenues for detection of functional consequences of elevated temperature in natural fish populations in a global warming scenario.A major paradox in developmental biology is the lack of conservation of sex-determining mechanisms even in closely related taxa (1). Thus, in mammals and birds, sex is genetically canalized by a chromosomal sex determination (CSD) system of male (XX/XY in mammals) or female (ZW/ZZ in birds) heterogamety, driven by the action of a master sex-determining gene: sry in mammals and dmrt1 in birds (1). In contrast, fish sex can be very plastic, with the combination of genetic and environmental influences (2). In addition to fish species with CSD, there are species with polygenic sex determination (PSD), in which sex depends on the combined action of several promale and profemale genetic factors, and species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) (3). Understanding how the environment influences sex ratios in vertebrates is of fundamental importance in the study of the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms (4, 5). It is also of practical relevance in evaluating the effects of climate change and chemical pollution (6, 7).The effects of temperature on gene expression during sex differentiation have been investigated in different teleost species, including the African catfish, Clarias gariepinus (8), European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax (9, 10), Japanese flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus (11), pejerrey, Odontesthes bonariensis (12), and Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (13, 14). Regardless of the actual underlying sex-determining mechanism, a shared characteristic of all fish species in which temperature can alter sex ratios is that exposure to heat during early development up-regulates the expression of genes related to testis differentiation with a concomitant down-regulation of genes related to ovarian differentiation, as assessed in several species (e.g., 9, 13, 15⇓–17). This results in an increase in the proportion of males (18) and implies that some genetic females (XX or ZW females) in CSD species, or fish that otherwise would develop as females in a PSD system, end up developing as phenotypic males despite their genetic makeup. These masculinized or sex-reversed females are called “neomales,” and have testicular structure (19) and gene expression profiles similar or identical to those of males (20, 21) and can produce viable sperm. In fact, in several farmed species with male heterogametic sex determination, hormone- or heat-induced XX neomales are crossed with regular XX females and used for the production of all-female stocks (22). However, a complete picture of the underlying molecular mechanisms of heat-induced sex reversal in fish, including signaling pathways, is far from clear. In addition, interesting problems such as why some females resist heat-induced masculinization whereas others do not and whether there are morphological and/or transcriptomic differences between these two classes of females have never been investigated.The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a small tropical fish that has become an established model for many fields of research. Sex differentiation starts about 10 d post fertilization (dpf) with the development of a juvenile ovary in all individuals, regardless of the actual sexual genotype (23, 24). Then, during the 21- to 35-dpf period, in the future males the juvenile ovaries undergo apoptosis and are transformed into testes, with interindividual variation in the timing and duration to complete this process. In contrast, ovarian differentiation continues in the future females (25), with an increase in cytoplasm volume of oocytes at around 60 dpf. Transcriptomic analysis of zebrafish sex differentiation has shown that apoptosis (24), activated by the p53 signaling pathway (26), is required for testis differentiation, whereas up-regulation of the canonical Wnt and NF-κB signaling pathways is needed for ovarian differentiation (27, 28).Zebrafish sex differentiation is, therefore, well-understood in its major aspects. In contrast, its primary sex-determining system was unclear until recently. Data from most cytogenetic studies (for a review, see ref. 29) and breeding experiments (30, 31) indicated the lack of sex chromosomes, pointing to PSD, whereas a hormonal sex reversal experiment (32) and restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) mapping data from crosses involving wild-type parents pointed toward a ZZ/ZW CSD system (33, 34). Eventually, comparative analysis of wild-caught and domesticated lines indicated the presence of sex chromosomes in the former and the apparent loss of the region harboring the sex-determining gene during the domestication process in the latter (34). This change in the mode of SD might be the cause for domesticated zebrafish being more susceptible to environmental changes and therefore well-suited for studying the effects of elevated temperature on its development.In domesticated zebrafish, the effects of elevated temperature have been studied after exposure periods concerning embryos (35), juveniles (36, 37), or development until adults (38, 39). In agreement with the general pattern in fish (18), elevated temperatures result in a higher number of males, although, surprisingly, one study reported more females (40). However, most of the above experiments involved progeny derived from a single family, mixtures of several broods, low sample sizes, or offspring from gynogenetic parents, the latter raising the possibility of unaccounted effects of inbreeding. In addition, transcriptomic studies in zebrafish on the effect of exposure to heat are limited and were usually performed shortly after heat treatment (41). Therefore, a detailed study on how elevated temperature affects sex ratios in a family-dependent manner and the long-term transcriptomic effects in domesticated zebrafish with PSD is not available.Thus, domesticated strains of zebrafish, by virtue of having lost the primary switch of their SD system, provide an excellent opportunity to investigate, in a well-established model rich in genomic resources, the influences of the environment on sex determination and gonad differentiation. In this study, we used a combination of approaches to characterize the sex ratio response to temperature in this model and, importantly, to study the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for heat-induced masculinization.The sex ratio determined for 11 different pairs of the AB strain by growing their offspring to maturity at control temperature (28 °C) ranged from 13 to 100% males (Fig. 1A; for details, see SI Appendix, Materials and Methods). First, we performed experiments to determine whether temperature affected the adult sex ratio and, if so, to delineate the optimal conditions of heat treatment for this study. Thus, we subjected eight families (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11) to four different temperatures: 22 °C, 28 °C, 34 °C, and 36 °C. Treatments were administered during three different developmental periods: 0 to 14, 7 to 21, and 18 to 32 dpf. The lowest temperature (22 °C; LT) did not cause a significant change in sex ratio compared with untreated controls in any of the three periods tested (SI Appendix, Fig. S1), and therefore this temperature was not further considered. Temperature treatment during the 0- to 14-dpf period resulted in survival rates below the acceptable standards recommended by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)’s Fish Sexual Developmental Test on zebrafish (42), and thus this period was excluded from the following experiments. The analysis of the 7- to 21- and 18- to 32-dpf periods gave similar results, so we chose the latter because fish were more robust after that treatment. Results obtained after applying 34 °C indicated that there was little or incomplete masculinization. At 36 °C (HT), a significant increase in the masculinization rate was observed compared with the control temperature (28 °C; CT) (P < 0.05; Fig. 1B). Although masculinization was still incomplete, the proportion of males obtained was higher than at 34 °C. Thus, we performed the subsequent heat treatments at 36 °C and during the exposure period of 18 to 32 dpf.Masculinizing effect of early high-temperature treatment in zebrafish. (A) Sex ratio variability in zebrafish broods originating from 11 different families when reared at control temperature (28 °C). For five families (4 to 7 and 9), where two to six broods from repeated crosses were analyzed, the mean ± SEM is shown. A total of 1,202 fish were used. (B) Early treatment (18 to 32 dpf) with high temperature (36 °C) increased the proportion of males. The mean ± SEM of six independent families for control (28 °C; n = 421) and treated (36 °C; n = 316) groups is shown. Statistically significant differences were found between the two sex ratios (P < 0.05; χ2 test). (C) Genotype-dependent variation of the sex ratio response to high temperature (36 °C), as illustrated by the broods originating from six different families. Lines between data points represent significant (solid) and nonsignificant (dashed) differences between control (28 °C) and heat-treated (36 °C) groups. The number of offspring individuals sexed per family were as follows: family 1, n = 110; family 2, n = 92; family 4, n = 112; family 6, n = 168; family 8, n = 56; family 9, n = 199. # indicates family IDs from A. (D) Increase in male proportion at 90 dpf after early exposure to high temperature (36 °C; 7 to 32 dpf; n = 51) in a zebrafish brood originating from a family (#2) that produced a female-biased offspring (70% females) when reared at control temperature (28 °C; n = 41). FCT, females control temp. FHT, females high temp. MCT, males control temp. MHT, males high temp. (E) Clustering of untreated controls (28 °C; blue) and heat-treated (36 °C; orange) 90-dpf fish based on their gonadal transcriptome profiles by principal component analysis (PCA). Whereas the majority of males and females formed a tight group each, two males (MHT2) and two females (FHT2) with different profiles could be observed in both sexes among fish exposed to 36 °C.When the offspring from six families (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9; Fig. 1A) were subjected to heat treatment (36 °C; 18 to 32 dpf) and were compared with their respective controls, three of them (1, 2, and 6) had a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the proportion of males, two of them (4 and 9) had a modest, nonsignificant (P = 0.07) increase, whereas for family 8 the sex ratio of the offspring remained unchanged (Fig. 1C). These results show that, although the extent of masculinization was family-specific, in most cases higher temperatures led to an increased proportion of males, denoting the existence of a clear genotype-by-environment (GxE) interaction during gonad differentiation. One of the families (2; 30% males; Fig. 1D) shows a female-biased family at control temperature that became male-biased (90% males) after heat treatment. Thus, it was estimated that a substantial proportion (60%) of the heat-treated fish underwent sex reversal to become phenotypic males (neomales; Fig. 1D). The remaining 10% in the population represent heat-resistant individuals that continued to develop as females despite the heat treatment. Whether there is an underlying genetic difference between these females and the neomales is not known.The survival of control and heat-exposed fish was measured at three different time points: 6, 50, and 90 dpf. Survival was always within the acceptable limits defined by OECD-recommended standards (42). There was an overall significant (P < 0.01) reduction in the number of fish surviving at 50 dpf compared with 6 dpf for both control and heat-treated groups (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A), indicating that the mortality was not due to temperature. Thereafter, the number of surviving fish did not significantly change until they were sampled at the end of the experiment at 90 dpf. Furthermore, at each considered age there were no significant differences between the survivals of heat-treated fish compared with controls (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A). Therefore, observed sex ratio results are not due to differential survival of one sex with respect to the other.At 90 dpf, there were no statistically significant differences between the body weight and standard length of males and females exposed to elevated temperature during the thermosensitive period compared with controls of the same sex (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B). These results indicated that effects observed in the gonadal transcriptome (see section below) of heat-exposed individuals were due to a direct temperature effect on the gonads and not to indirect temperature effects through possible differences in size.When the maturation level of gonads was checked visually and histologically at 90 dpf, we found three types of gonads in both sexes: immature (type 1), maturing and differentiating (type 2), and mature and differentiated (type 3) (for a detailed description of these three gonadal types in both sexes, see SI Appendix, Materials and Methods, Fig. S3, and Table S1). We found differences in gonadal maturation depending on temperature treatment and sex. At control temperature, type 1 gonads were observed in more than half of the males examined, as opposed to only one-fifth of the females (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 C and D, respectively). Interestingly, at high temperature, a significantly higher percentage of type 3 gonads was observed in males (43.8% vs. 21.8%; P < 0.001) compared with controls (SI Appendix, Fig. S2C), whereas, in contrast, in females the proportion of type 3 gonads was reduced from ∼50% in the controls to ∼37% in the fish exposed to 36 °C, although differences were not statistically significant (SI Appendix, Fig. S2D).Compared with 34 °C, treatment at 36 °C also increased the incidence of deformities, ranging from 0 to 42.6%, depending on the family, as observed in a subset of samples (n = 53 individuals). Deformities included a swollen belly, spinal cord malformation, and loss of pigmentation, regardless of the treatment period. However, all fish used for transcriptomic analysis had a normal morphology.For microarray analysis, we used a custom-designed array (see SI Appendix, Materials and Methods for details) and individuals from one family (2; Fig. 1C) with a female-biased sex ratio (30% males) at 28 °C and with a strong masculinization effect (90% males) at 36 °C (Fig. 1D) to maximize the probability of finding neomales. We isolated the gonads from 4 adult females and 10 adult males at 90 dpf of each group (28 °C and 36 °C), and the whole gonad for each fish was hybridized individually. A higher number of males than females were analyzed to increase the chance for identifying potential differences between the transcriptomes of males and neomales.When the resulting expression profiles were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA; see Dataset S1 for PCA loadings), two distinct transcriptomic profiles were observed for the control group (28 °C; CT), corresponding to control females (FCT) and control males (MCT), as expected (Fig. 1E and SI Appendix, Table S2). A large number of transcripts (14,783) were differentially expressed between these two groups (Fig. 2A). These differences were not due to temperature but to sex, and represent a substantial proportion of protein-coding genes in zebrafish (43). This concurs with previous observations (44⇓–46) showing large sex-related differences in the gonadal transcriptome of the adult zebrafish.Gonadal transcriptome analysis shows differential expression between adults exposed to high temperature early in development. (A) Pairwise comparison of gonadal transcriptome profiles between control and heat-treated zebrafish grouped based on the results of principal component analysis. Only two different gonadal transcriptomes are observed at the control temperature (Lower), corresponding to control females (FCT) and control males (MCT). Exposure to high temperature resulted in two female transcriptomes, FHT1 and FHT2, as well as two male transcriptomes, MHT1 and MHT2 (Upper). The FHT2 and MHT2 transcription profiles differed not only from each other but also from those of control males (MCT) and females (FCT). Numbers of differentially expressed transcripts [fold change (FC), 1.5×; false discovery rate (FDR), P ≤ 0.01] between two phenotypes are indicated in the white rectangles. Sample sizes: FCT, n = 4; FHT1, n = 2; FHT2, n = 2; MCT, n = 10; MHT1, n = 8; MHT2, n = 2. (B and C) Venn diagram representation of biological process GO terms (B) up-regulated or (C) down-regulated in MHT1, MHT2, or FHT2 in pairwise comparison with FCT, as determined by microarray analysis (FC, 1.5×; FDR, P ≤ 0.01; see SI Appendix, Fig. S5 for similar Venn diagrams showing differentially expressed cellular component and molecular functions GO terms, as well as Dataset S4 for the complete list of all GO terms shown in this figure).Among the 10 HT males randomly selected from this family for transcriptomic analysis, we observed two different profiles (Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Fig. S4A): Eight of the 10 sampled HT males exhibited what we named the MHT1 profile (SI Appendix, Table S2), namely transcriptomically identical to MCT (a complete lack of differentially expressed transcripts; DETs; Fig. 1E). This resemblance was also reflected by comparing MHT1 and MCT males vs. FCT females, because a similar number of DETs were observed (14,666 and 14,783, respectively). The remaining two HT males had an MHT2 profile and formed a distinct cluster on the PCA plot (Fig. 1E). Based on the proportions of HT fish (Fig. 1D), we expected three or four normal males and six or seven neomales, which would have developed as females at control temperature (SI Appendix, Fig. S4B). This showed that some of the heat-induced neomales had gonadal expression profiles identical to those of regular males. Thus, both MHT2 males are likely to be neomales, with gonadal transcriptomes that differed from MHT1 males and FCT females by 792 and 13,057 DETs (Dataset S2), respectively. Likewise, half of the MHT1 males are also likely to be neomales.For HT females, we found that (i) the PCA plot revealed two very distinct transcriptomic profiles, which we named FHT1 and FHT2 females (Fig. 1E); (ii) expression analysis showed that FHT2 females had a much higher number of DETs compared with FCT females (9,651) or even with FHT1 females (7,593) than with MHT2 males (1,188) (Fig. 2A); (iii) hierarchical clustering further supported the above observations by placing FHT2 females into the same clade with the males (SI Appendix, Fig. S4A). Together, these results showed that the gonadal transcriptome of FHT2 females was strikingly similar to that of males, despite having female gonadal morphology. On the other hand, the transcriptomic profile of the remaining high temperature-exposed females (FHT1) was very similar to that of control females, with only 20 DETs observed between the two groups (Fig. 2A and Dataset S2).Thus, PCA-based classification of the gonadal transcriptome profiles, which explained more than half of the total observed variance (51.6%), allowed a clear arrangement of the different transcriptomic profiles in a Cartesian space (FCT→FHT1→FHT2→MHT2→MHT1→MCT) based on the magnitude of DETs among them (Fig. 2A and Dataset S2). In summary, we found a good match overall between the number of males and females, as determined by visual and histological gonadal analysis, and the results from the microarray-based transcriptomic analysis. Females appeared to show a more variable response to heat-induced masculinization than males, potentially indicating a threshold-based mechanism, and some of the gonadal/transcriptomic combinations produced in the former were unexpected.Next, we performed a pairwise comparison of the gonadal transcriptomic profiles of heat-treated fish that had the largest differences with those of control females (i.e., FHT2, MHT2, and MHT1 vs. FCT) and also comparisons among heated males and females (i.e., FHT1 vs. FHT2, FHT2 vs. MHT2, and MHT2 vs. MHT1) and searched for both up- and down-regulated DETs, creating separate lists per comparison (Dataset S2). Among these lists, we looked at the expression of 48 genes selected for their importance for reproduction and sex differentiation in fish (SI Appendix, Materials and Methods and Dataset S3). Among the comparisons, we found that some genes with promale function (e.g., dmrt1, amh, hsd11b2, cyp11c1) were up-regulated in control (MCT) and heated males (MHT1 and MHT2) compared with control females (FCT) but also in FHT2 heated females (FHT2 vs. FCT), whereas some genes with profemale function (e.g., cyp19a1a, foxl2, fancl, esr2a, figα) were down-regulated in all of the mentioned comparisons (full gene names and their abbreviations can be found in SI Appendix, Table S7, and in Dataset S2). None of these genes were differentially expressed between FHT1 and FCT, and only a few between MHT1 and MCT, MHT2 and MHT1, and MHT2 and FHT2, indicating transcriptomic similarity between the groups in these comparisons.These lists were used for Gene Ontology (GO)-enrichment analysis (SI Appendix, Materials and Methods). In the biological process (BP) category, there were 700 GO terms found to be enriched between the three comparisons that are potentially involved in masculinization (Fig. 2 B and C). The differentially expressed cellular component (CC) and molecular functions (MF) GO terms are shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S5, and all of the above-mentioned GO terms are listed in Dataset S4. Some GO terms that were enriched in the up-regulated DET lists of FHT2, MHT2, and MHT1 were related to the male pathway, such as spermatid development (GO:0007286) and insulin-like growth factor binding (GO:0005520). On the other hand, the down-regulated DET lists were enriched with GO terms related to the female pathway, such as gonad development (GO:0008585), sex differentiation (GO:0046660), and ovarian follicle development (GO:0001541).To validate the microarray results and obtain expression data from key reproduction-related genes, we performed quantitative (q)PCR analysis on a subset of 35 genes that showed significantly different expression levels in at least one of the following comparisons: MHT1 vs. FCT, MHT2 vs. FCT, FHT2 vs. FCT, and MCT vs. FCT. The direction and magnitude of change for over two-thirds of the genes examined (mean, 80.5%; range, 62.5 to 92.5%) showed an agreement between the two methods, thus validating our microarray results (SI Appendix, Tables S3 and S4).A heat map was generated using the expression profiles of these 35 genes determined by qPCR (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). The dendrogram showed two major branches, one containing only females (FCT and FHT1 clades) and the other branch containing all of the males together with the two FHT2 females. This clustering showed that the transcriptome of FHT2 females was more similar to those of the males than of FCT females, confirming the previous PCA results (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, genes were grouped into two major branches, one containing genes involved in male sex differentiation (e.g., amh, dmrt1, cyp11c1, etc.) and the other containing genes involved in female sex differentiation (e.g., cyp19a1a, foxl2, vtg5, etc.) (Fig. 3 and SI Appendix, Fig. S6 and Table S3). The expression profiles of both gene subsets were in agreement with the expected changes in both sexes. Genes involved in male sex differentiation showed higher expression levels in the three male groups (MCT, MHT1, and MHT2) and, interestingly, in the FHT2 group as well (Fig. 3 A–C). The opposite pattern was observed for genes involved in female sex differentiation (Fig. 3 D–F).Gene expression profiles of six candidate genes with sex-associated function support the expression profiles of FHT2 females and MHT2 males. These data were obtained by qPCR analysis of gonadal expression levels at 90 dpf. The expression level of three genes with “promale” function (A–C) and three with “profemale” function (D–F) are shown relative to those of control females (FCT). Females are marked in red (FHT1 and FHT2) and males are marked in blue (MCT, MHT1, and MHT2). Average values from 2 to 10 individuals per group are shown with standard error of the mean (SEM). Values that show a statistically significant difference from FCT are labeled as: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, or ***P < 0.001; all Student’s t test.Then, we compared the expression profiles of these 35 validated genes across the six identified transcriptome types by performing pairwise comparison, with FCT as the reference group (SI Appendix, Table S3). Results showed that there were no significant differences between FHT1 and FCT, indicating a strong concordance in expression levels. Furthermore, 25 and 26 genes in MHT1 and MCT, respectively, showed significantly different expression levels (P < 0.01) compared with FCT. Compared with FCT, the FHT2 and MHT2 groups had 19 and 17 DE genes, respectively. These data provided yet another level of confirmation for, on one hand, the similarity between both female groups (FHT1 and FCT) and that of male groups MHT1 and MCT and, on the other hand, the Cartesian arrangement previously observed with the PCA.Results presented so far were obtained in adult zebrafish at 90 dpf, 2 mo after the end of the heat treatment, and thus represent long-lasting consequences of heat exposure on the gonadal transcriptome. We were also interested in assessing the immediate effects of heat exposure. Thus, we collected 10 control (JCT) and 10 heat-exposed (JHT) juveniles from another heat-responsive family (1; Fig. 1C; percent males at 90 dpf: controls, 13%; heat-exposed, 88%) by sampling them at 37 dpf, that is, 5 d after the end of the heat treatment, to avoid the period of heat shock protein induction. We performed microarray analysis on RNA samples obtained from body trunks (as at this stage the gonad was too small to isolate) and found two outliers from the JCT samples due to poor hybridization results, which were removed from further analysis. PCA of the microarray results revealed two groups in the control juveniles, named JCT1 (five individuals) and JCT2 (three individuals) (Fig. 4A). We found 425 DETs between these two groups (Dataset S2). Sexing of the juvenile zebrafish by examining external phenotypes at this age is not possible. Therefore, we included in the hierarchical clustering samples from the Tg(vasa:vasa-egfp) transgenic line (47) collected at similar age (35 and 42 dpf), because it allows for early sexing from 16 dpf onward (25). This way, we were able to infer the sex of the two juvenile groups at control temperature (JCT1 and JCT2). All JCT1 samples formed a clade with those transgenics that had strong gonadal fluorescence, indicating future females (Fig. 4B). In contrast, all JCT2 samples clustered with those that had very weak fluorescence intensity, denoting future males. Transcriptome-based molecular sexing for the whole group of JCT juveniles showed a female-biased sex ratio, in agreement with the adult sex ratio of this family. Then, we applied the same procedure to the JHT juveniles and found that all of them clustered with transgenic fish exhibiting weak gonadal fluorescence and JCT2 juveniles (Fig. 4B), indicating that all of them had a “male-like” transcriptomic profile after heat treatment even though they showed a diffuse profile on the PCA plot (Fig. 4A).Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of juveniles (control, JCT; heat-treated, JHT) analyzed at 37 dpf shows groups related to sex (JCT, n = 8; JHT, n = 10). (A) PCA plot produced by expression profiles showing JCT clustered into two groups, namely JCT1 (orange) with five individuals and JCT2 (dark blue) with three individuals. All 10 JHT individuals (green) were placed in a single group. (B) Hierarchical clustering of control and heat-exposed juveniles together with Tg(vasa:vasa-egfp) juveniles using the 425 differentially expressed transcripts between JCT1 (orange) and JCT2 (dark blue). Juveniles in the JCT1 group were most likely females, as they clustered with transgenic juveniles that showed strong fluorescence intensity (future females; pink). The JCT2 juveniles were most likely males, as they were in the same node as the transgenic juveniles with weak fluorescence intensity (future males; light blue). All of the 10 heat-treated juveniles (JHT; green) clustered with the weak fluorescence transgenic juveniles and JCT2, indicating a similar male-like transcriptomic profile regardless of their genetic sex.We found 75 second-level GO terms (BP, CC, and MF) showing significant differences when comparing JCT2 vs. JCT1 (all of them down-regulated) and 295 GO terms in JHT vs. JCT1 (Dataset S4). There were 68 GO terms that were common between the two comparisons and therefore related to male differentiation (JCT2 and JHT groups). Some of those were involved in female sex differentiation and down-regulated, for example female gamete generation (GO:0007292) and oogenesis (GO:0046620). However, some of the GO terms related to the male pathway were also down-regulated compared with JCT1 (profemales), for example spermatid development (GO:0007286) and spermatogenesis (GO:0007283). Interestingly, and exclusively related to the heat response (only found in the JHT vs. JCT1 comparison), we found a down-regulation of some GO terms associated with female sex differentiation such as oocyte maturation (GO:0001556) and ovarian follicle development (GO:0001541), suggesting that reprogramming was taking place already at the time of heat exposure.We also performed qPCR analysis on the juvenile samples using 26 of the 35 DE genes validated in adults. In the JCT2 vs. JCT1 and JHT vs. JCT1 comparisons, the expression of more than two-thirds (84.6% and 76.9%, respectively) of the genes examined showed a significant (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) change in the same direction with both methods (SI Appendix, Table S4). Genes involved in testis differentiation, such as dkk3 or cyp11c1, were up-regulated in the JCT2 and JHT groups, whereas those related to ovarian development, such as cyp19a1a or zp2, were down-regulated, as previously found in adults. Overall, the qPCR results (SI Appendix, Fig. S7 and Table S4), together with the hierarchical clustering data (Fig. 4B), indicated that both JHT and JCT2 groups had a promale transcriptome, probably at different stages of gonadal development.Four different patterns of gene expression profiles from 50 genes were observed between heat-treated juveniles and adults in comparison with their respective controls (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Table S5). (i) Permanent effects involved genes that responded similarly both in juveniles and adults. For example, dnd expression was consistently and significantly down-regulated. (ii) Transient or inconsistent effects involved genes for which differences in expression were observed in juveniles but not in adults, or those that responded differently at the two stages. For example, sox9a was up-regulated in juveniles but not in adults, and foxl2 expression was up-regulated in juveniles but down-regulated in adults. (iii) Delayed effects included genes, such as amh or dnmt3b, for which differences were observed only in adults, long after the heat treatment had ceased. (iv) No effect involved genes, such as fshr, for which no significant differences were found between the treated and control groups in juveniles or adults.Effects of heat on zebrafish gonad gene expressionThen, we looked for cellular pathways involved in the heat response and sex differentiation in the gonads. A total of 256 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were differentially expressed among juveniles and adults treated by heat (Dataset S5), 66 of which were unique and nonredundant pathways. Among the nonredundant pathways, 42 were enriched across the different adult groups analyzed (Fig. 5A) and included signaling pathways that were known to be involved in gonadal development. To further study the different effects of heat from juvenile to adult, we also analyzed the common pathways expressed in adults and juveniles, finding a total of 17 common pathways (Fig. 5B and Dataset S5). Four important pathways for ovarian development, namely Fanconi anemia, Wnt signaling, oocyte meiosis, and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, were down-regulated in FHT2 and in all of the adult male phenotype groups compared with FCT (Fig. 5C). On the other hand, three KEGG pathways that were involved in testis development were up-regulated in all of the adult male groups and FHT2 (Fig. 5C). These signaling pathways are the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, calcium signaling pathway in cardiac muscle contraction, and cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction.Differentially expressed (DE) KEGG pathways found in juveniles and adult zebrafish exposed to heat during early stages of development (18 to 32 dpf) in comparison with controls.

(C) List of pathways (four profemale and three promale) involved in the heat response and sex differentiation in the gonads of juvenile and adult fish showing early activation of promale pathways in the heat-treated juveniles. Up-regulated KEGG pathways are labeled in red, down-regulated are labeled in blue, and not differentially expressed are labeled in gray (FC, 1.5×; FDR, P ≤ 0.05).The same pathways were also affected in the control male juveniles (JCT2) and heat-treated juveniles (JHT) compared with control female juveniles (JCT1). Two of the pathways with promale signaling elements (cardiac muscle contraction and cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction) were up-regulated in the JHT group but not differentially expressed in the JCT2 group (Fig. 5C). For the four profemale pathways, two of them (oocyte meiosis and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation) were down-regulated in both JHT and JCT2 compared with JCT1, whereas the Wnt signaling pathway was up-regulated only in the JHT group (Fig. 5C).In this study, we first optimized the conditions to examine the effects of high temperature during early development on zebrafish sex ratios. Then, we focused on identifying the associated changes in the gonadal transcriptome at juvenile and adult stages.Our results on sex ratio variation among, but not within, families of domesticated zebrafish corroborate previous observations from other PSD systems (48⇓–50), namely that at normal temperatures offspring sex ratio has a genetic component with strong influence of parental genotypes (30). These data support the earlier claims that sex determination in domesticated zebrafish is polygenic (30, 31, 33, 51). Then, with the temperature experiments performed in this study, we added an additional level of complexity to this polygenic system by showing different family-by-temperature crossing reaction norms, hence demonstrating the existence of GxE interactions. Together, these results illustrate that domesticated zebrafish are more susceptible to external environmental cues, most likely as a consequence of having lost its sex-determining locus due to several generations of manipulations (34). Hence, it is an excellent model for investigating environmental influences on sex determination. Our results, therefore, emphasize the interplay between genetic and environmental influences and provide a potential explanation for the variable sex ratios observed in zebrafish facilities across the world, which are often unpredictable and biased.The masculinizing effect of elevated temperature confirms previous results in zebrafish (36, 39) and correlates with results found in the literature in many other fish species (for reviews, see refs. 16 and 18). However, previous transcriptional studies in zebrafish exposed to temperature were restricted to the first 48 h postfertilization (41, 52). Our results, in contrast, provide a comprehensive analysis of the short- and long-term effects of heat on the gonadal transcriptome of both juvenile and adult zebrafish exposed to elevated temperatures during the period of sex differentiation.We thus exploited temperature effects to study the gonadal expression profiles of heat-exposed fish, comparing individuals that persisted as males, persisted as females, or were neomales. During the course of this study, we examined the gonads of a total of 1,202 untreated fish, 454 fish exposed to low temperature, and 826 heat-treated fish. Not a single intersex individual with ovotestis was observed (i.e., all fish examined were either males or females). Nonetheless, the possibility of finding intersex individuals among all experimental fish cannot be completely discarded. A major finding is the discovery of two types of heat-exposed males and two types of heat-exposed females, with each type having a different transcriptomic profile. We found that most heat-treated males (MHT1) had a gonadal transcriptome identical to that of control males (MCT). The MHT1 males likely contain both genetic males and neomales, whereas the rest of heat-treated males (MHT2) were most likely neomales (described in detail below).Heat-exposed females that remained phenotypic females were either unaffected (FHT1) or affected (FHT2). Both types of females maintained a normal ovarian morphology at the macroscopic level. The gonadal transcriptome of FHT1 females was essentially identical to that of control females (FCT); the underlying mechanism responsible for this resistance to heat is unknown and deserves further research. On the other hand, FHT2 females had gonad transcriptomes that were quite different from control ovaries and, surprisingly, differed by only ∼1,200 DETs from MHT2 males despite having different gonadal phenotypes. This difference represents just a fraction (8%) of the ∼15,000 DETs that were differentially expressed between untreated females (FCT) and males (MCT), which, in turn, account for a significant part of the estimated number of protein-coding genes (>25,000) in zebrafish.In fish, masculinization by elevated temperature usually involves down-regulation of profemale genes, such as cyp19a1a and foxl2, and up-regulation of promale genes, such as dmrt1 or amh (8⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–14). In accordance with this general pattern, the FHT2 females with a male-like gonadal transcriptome exhibited down-regulation of both key profemale genes such as cyp19a1a and vtg5 as well as down-regulation of profemale pathways such as oocyte meiosis, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, canonical Wnt signaling (28, 53), and Fanconi anemia (26). Another profemale pathway, the NF-κB pathway, involved in blocking apoptosis through an inflammatory process during ovarian development (27), was not affected, although some of its genes (e.g., bcl2, nfkb, tradd) were down-regulated. On the other hand, genes related to testis differentiation such as amh and dmrt1 were up-regulated, together with male-related pathways such as the calcium signaling pathway in cardiac muscle contraction, which regulates Leydig cell steroidogenesis in mice (54). We speculate that these FHT2 females are “superfemales” that were able to resist heat-induced phenotypic masculinization, thus maintaining their ovarian morphology despite changing their gonadal transcriptome to a testis-like one. These FHT2 individuals did not likely have ovotestes, as neither the histological analysis of their siblings’ gonads nor extreme similarity of their gonadal transcriptome to that of control males provided such indications. Missexing the gonads based on their color and shape was unlikely, as adult zebrafish gonads are sufficiently different, allowing for their classification by trained eyes (SI Appendix, Tables S1 and S6). Thus, in our opinion, the most likely explanation for the apparent controversy between an ovarian gonadal phenotype and a testicular transcriptome is a major shift in the ovarian gene expression landscape to a testis-like one that was unable to force a complete gonadal transformation. Therefore, given their importance for reproduction, the potential resilience shown by gonads to the influence of external factors, particularly in an organism known for its plasticity, seems notable. An interesting open question for future studies concerns the number and type of additional genes that would need to be altered to cause not only transcriptional but also morphological sex reversal. Threshold hypothesis for heat-induced masculinization supports previous observations in the European sea bass in which heat-resistant fish were females that could not be masculinized by high temperature (55).The discovery of heat-exposed females possessing ovaries with apparently normal macroscopic phenotype and a near-testicular expression profile potentially indicates major organ transcriptomic reprogramming in vivo during the course of gonadal development with preserved organ structure. It is known that, if conveniently directed, reprogramming can change cell identity (56). Further, epigenetic reprogramming is essential during vertebrate gonadogenesis and early development (57). Although targeting the stem cell microenvironment is believed to be important for proper tissue reprogramming (reviewed in ref. 58), earlier attempts at induced in vivo reprogramming in rodent models have resulted in the appearance of teratomas in multiple tissues (59). Our observation may be linked to the extraordinary plasticity of fish gonads compared with most other vertebrate tissues (60, 61), and constitutes an aspect that deserves further study.We also explored the effects of heat on juvenile fish, allowing comparison of early vs. late changes in transcription profiles. Only 425 transcripts showed differential expression between the control juveniles of both sexes, thus representing a small fraction of DETs identified between adult testis and ovary. For the juvenile RNA extraction, a portion of the trunk containing the gonad was used, as it was technically challenging to isolate such a small gonad organ. Therefore, this low number of DETs could be due to the dilution effect from other tissues in the trunk. All heat-exposed juveniles exhibited a male-like gonadal transcriptome shortly after the end of the exposure period.As with adults, female-related pathways such as oocyte meiosis and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation were down-regulated. Interestingly, cardiac muscle contraction and cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction processes that contain promale pathways were up-regulated in the heat-exposed juveniles (JHT), as observed in the groups with adult males (MCT, MHT1, and MHT2) and heat-treated FHT2 females (Fig. 5C). However, these promale pathways were not differentially expressed in the juvenile control males (JCT2) compared with control females (JCT1). This suggests that heat exposure during the juvenile phase activates the promale pathways earlier than at the control temperature, resulting in the observed male-like transcriptomic profile.Regarding the neomales referred to earlier, we found that the gonadal transcriptome of most neomales was very similar to that of regular control males. We cannot exclude the possibility that heat and other masculinizing factors such as stress (62) can produce neomales with characteristics very similar to males. In zebrafish facilities, these fish might be used as “males” in studies of genetics, development, and so forth. We do not know whether heat-induced neomales can produce male-biased offspring even in the absence of elevated temperature, resulting in an epigenetic transmission of altered states (63⇓–65). In the European sea bass, the first link between environmental temperature and sex mediated by an epigenetic mechanism was described (10). Heat-exposed females exhibited increased DNA methylation of their cyp19a1a promoter, with a concomitant reduction in cyp19a1a mRNA levels, resulting in male-biased sex ratios (10). Epigenetic modifications of cyp19a1a were also reported during sex change in the rice field eel (66). In fish, transgenerational effects of heat exposure have been recently described (67). In the tongue sole, Cynoglossus semilaevis, which has a ZW/ZZ sex-determining system as in wild zebrafish, heat-induced neomales were responsible for the epigenetic transmission of DNA-altered states, resulting in the production of masculinized offspring even at normal temperatures (68). DNA methylation changes occur due to the activity of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts). Dnmts have been identified in zebrafish, and there is evidence that their expression can change with temperature (69). In our study, we found that the expression of dnmt3b, together with other key reproduction genes (amh, cyp19a1a, dmrt1, etc.; Table 1), showed heat responses with delayed effects, as their expression was altered in adults but not in juveniles following termination of the heat treatment. These results indicate that heat-induced masculinization likely requires or involves epigenetic mechanisms and, based on the evidence from other fish species (70, 71), further studies should focus on transgenerational effects of heat and investigate whether these lasting effects could be detected in subsequent generations.Zebrafish is considered to have a wide thermal tolerance zone (72) and lives in the 16.5 to 38.6 °C range of temperature in the wild (73, 74). Interestingly, the elevated temperature used in this study, 36 °C, falls within the above range. If the sensibility of natural populations were similar to that found in laboratory strains, even despite having an intact sex-determining mechanism, then the question is whether wild populations exposed to abnormally high temperature also contain sensitive families with a proportion of sex-reversed females (neomales) and females with ovaries expressing a male-like transcriptome, as found in our study. Chances of finding these fish would increase during particularly warm years, as a decline of wild-type zebrafish populations due to climate change has been described recently (38). In other species, such as Nile tilapia, which can also tolerate high temperatures, the presence of neomales has been strongly suggested in Kpandu and Koka natural populations (75). If they reach adulthood and reproduce, neomales can produce sex-biased (75% females) progeny in a ZZ/ZW system, if the WW genotype is viable (76), or 100% females in a XX/XY system (22). Severely biased sex ratios may have potentially detrimental consequences for population viability (77). Another important question is whether the FHT2 individuals with a masculinized gonadal transcriptome would be able to develop a fully mature gonad or not and, if so, whether they would produce viable germ cells. This question poses a puzzling technical difficulty, as it is impossible to identify an ovary with a male-like transcriptome without extracting the gonad for molecular analysis. Understanding the reproduction of these females with a male-like transcriptome would be a challenge for endocrinologists and reproductive physiologists alike. Finally, finding the equivalent of our FHT2 females in zebrafish and/or other species in the natural environment would mean that the potential effects of elevated temperature should be reconsidered.In this study, we developed a protocol to learn the mechanisms of temperature-induced sex reversal in zebrafish. Our data demonstrated that in domesticated strains, the sex ratio response to elevated temperature is quite variable and family-specific, supporting a polygenic system of sex determination. We also show that elevated temperatures result in a variable number of neomales with a transcriptome similar to that of regular males but very different from that of unaffected females. Strikingly, we discovered that some individuals that have not been fully masculinized by the heat treatment had ovaries with a male-like transcriptome, potentially indicating transcriptomic reprogramming in vivo with preserved organ structure. To the best of our knowledge, this has never been reported, providing a sign of complex heat-induced masculinization effects in zebrafish that should serve to inspire further studies. These results reveal a previously unknown thermal effect on fish gonads, and suggest new avenues for the detection of functional consequences of elevated temperature in natural populations exposed to global warming.SI Appendix provides a detailed description of the materials and methods used in this study.The AB zebrafish strain and the Tg(vasa:vasa-egfp) zebrafish line of AB strain (78) were used for the temperature treatment experiments. Breeding protocols and husbandry details can be found in SI Appendix, Materials and Methods.Fish were housed at the experimental aquarium facilities of the Institute of Marine Sciences, CSIC according to approved institutional guidelines on the use of animals for research purposes and in agreement with European regulations of animal welfare (ETS N8 123,01/01/91). The Tg(vasa:vasa-egfp) zebrafish line was maintained at the Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory (TLL) Fish Facility according to the approved protocol of the TLL Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee [approval TLL (F)-10-001].Temperature treatments initially involved 11 different families grown until adulthood plus additional families raised until they were juveniles. We first defined the conditions (intensity, duration, timing, and survival) to properly study the effects of elevated temperature on zebrafish sex ratios within OECD guidelines (42). The control and high temperatures were set at 28 and 36 °C, respectively, and the time of application was set at 18 to 32 d postfertilization, coinciding with the period of sex differentiation. Temperature treatments are described in detail in SI Appendix, Materials and Methods.Gonads were collected at 37 (juveniles) and 90 (adults) dpf. To assess sex in adults, we used visual inspection of the gonad under a dissecting microscope. The dissection of Tg(vasa:vasa-egfp) juvenile zebrafish (35 and 42 dpf) was performed under a stereomicroscope equipped with a universal light source to ensure that the gonad (expressing vasa-egfp) was still intact in the trunk cavity after gutting. The fluorescence intensity observed is indicative of the future sex, with strong and weak gonadal fluorescence indicating future females and males, respectively. Fish sex was determined individually after dissection, and the sex ratio was calculated for each biological replicate. Both gonads were collected in the same tube and were stored in liquid nitrogen for subsequent gene expression analysis or fixed with PBS/paraformaldehyde and embedded in glycol methacrylate for histological analysis. Further details of sampling protocols and histological analysis are described in SI Appendix, Materials and Methods.A previously validated NimbleGen (Roche) custom zebrafish expression microarray containing 31,477 unique sequences was used [National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Platform GPL17795]. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol, and samples with mean RNA quality indicator (RQI) ≥9 were used. Raw fluorescence intensity data were retrieved from the scanned images by NimbleScan, and quantile normalization and background correction were applied. Microarray data were analyzed using Partek Genomics Suite according to MIAME guidelines (79), and DETs were identified by ANOVA using false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P ≤ 0.01 with at least a 1.5 fold change (FC) for multiple-hypothesis testing. Microarray results were deposited in the GEO database (accession no. GSE51434). Full details regarding the microarray analysis are described in SI Appendix, Materials and Methods.A high-throughput real-time qPCR array was designed to quantify the expression level of 50 genes, including 35 genes used for validating the microarray results. The qPCR array was performed using the Biomark HD System (Fluidigm). All qPCR reactions were run in triplicate. The genes eef1a1l1 and rpl13a were used as reference. Quantification cycle (Cq) data were imported into GenEx Pro (MultiD Analyses AB) for analysis. The relative quantity was calculated using juveniles (JCT1) or adult females (FCT) at control temperature as reference. Complete details of the qPCRs and PCR data analysis can be found in SI Appendix, Materials and Methods.We thank Dr. Francesc Maynou for assistance with statistical procedures, and Drs.

Dmrt1 has an early role in gonadal sex differentiation in male zebrafish.Zebrafish dmrt1 mutants primarily develop as fertile females.Rare dmrt1 mutant males have aberrant testis development and are sterile.Dmrt1 counteracts ovary-promoting signals from the germ line.Dmrt1 has an early role in gonadal sex differentiation in male zebrafish.The dmrt1 (doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1) gene is a key regulator of sex determination and/or gonadal sex differentiation across metazoan animals. This is unusual given that sex determination genes are typically not well conserved. The mechanisms by which zebrafish sex is determined have remained elusive due to the lack of sex chromosomes and the complex polygenic nature of sex determination in domesticated strains. To investigate the role of dmrt1 in zebrafish sex determination and gonad development, we isolated mutations disrupting this gene. We found that the majority of dmrt1 mutant fish develop as fertile females suggesting a complete male-to-female sex reversal in mutant animals that would have otherwise developed as males. A small percentage of mutant animals became males, but were sterile and displayed testicular dysgenesis. Therefore zebrafish dmrt1 functions in male sex determination and testis development. Mutant males had aberrant gonadal development at the onset of gonadal sex-differentiation, displaying reduced oocyte apoptosis followed by development of intersex gonads and failed testis morphogenesis and spermatogenesis. By contrast, female ovaries developed normally. We found that Dmrt1 is necessary for normal transcriptional regulation of the amh (anti-Müllerian hormone) and foxl2 (forkhead box L2) genes, which are thought to be important for male or female sexual development respectively. Interestingly, we identified one dmrt1 mutant allele that co-operates with a linked segregation distorter locus to generate an apparent XY sex determination mechanism. We conclude that dmrt1 is dispensable for ovary development but necessary for testis development in zebrafish, and that dmrt1 promotes male development by transcriptionally regulating male and female genes as has been described in other animals. Furthermore, the strong sex-ratio bias caused by dmrt1 reduction-of-function points to potential mechanisms through which sex chromosomes may evolve.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

More recently perchlorate has been shown to affect primordial sexual differentiation in the aquatic model fishes zebrafish and threespine stickleback, but the mechanism has been unclear. Stickleback exposed to perchlorate from fertilization have increased androgen levels in the embryo and disrupted reproductive morphologies as adults, suggesting that perchlorate could disrupt the earliest stages of primordial sexual differentiation when primordial germ cells (PGCs) begin to form the gonad. Female stickleback have three to four times the number of PGCs as males during the first weeks of development. We hypothesized that perchlorate exposure affects primordial sexual differentiation by reducing the number of germ cells in the gonad during an important window of stickleback sex determination at 14–18 days post fertilization (dpf). We tested this hypothesis by quantifying the number of PGCs at 16 dpf in control and 100 mg/L perchlorate-treated male and female stickleback. Perchlorate exposure from the time of fertilization resulted in significantly reduced PGC number only in genotypic females, suggesting that the masculinizing effects of perchlorate observed in adult stickleback may result from early changes to the number of PGCs at a time critical for sex determination. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of a connection between an endocrine disruptor and reduction in PGC number prior to the first meiosis during sex determination. These findings suggest that a mode of action of perchlorate on adult reproductive phenotypes in vertebrates, including humans, such as altered fecundity and sex reversal or intersex gonads, may stem from early changes to germ cell development.Citation: Petersen AM, Earp NC, Redmond ME, Postlethwait JH, von Hippel FA, Buck CL, et al.

This small molecule has been linked to a variety of developmental abnormalities associated with hypothyroidism in humans, including reduced cognitive function [2, 3]. Experimental exposure to perchlorate alters development and morphology of thyroid follicles in model organisms such as fish [4–6] and mice [7]. Perchlorate exposure in teleost fishes leads to a wide array of altered phenotypes, some of which suggest organizational effects during development in addition to activational effects on the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Thyroid (HPT) axis [4, 8–11]. Perchlorate exposure has negative effects on health and survivorship of vertebrates at environmentally relevant concentrations, usually in the range of parts per billion [12, 13], and in some parts of Texas, USA, levels have been measured in surface waters in the parts per million range [14].In addition to its effects on thyroid development and function, perchlorate also appears to act through an unknown mechanism to alter gonad development and sex determination in teleost fishes, a finding not predicted to occur solely via thyroid disruption [4, 6, 8, 11, 15]. Changes to reproductive development include increased androgen levels in larvae and adults, increased spermatogenesis, decreased oocyte maturation [6], and disruption of reproductive behaviors [16]. Perchlorate masculinizes the gonad in male and female threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus; hereafter ‘stickleback’), in addition to increasing the gonadal-somatic index in male stickleback [6, 8]. In some cases, perchlorate exposure causes genotypically female stickleback to develop into functional hermaphrodites [8]. Exposure to perchlorate in the first 42 days post fertilization (dpf) causes abnormalities in development of thyroid and reproductive systems in adult stickleback, suggesting early critical windows of development in which this chemical exerts lasting effects into adulthood [4, 10]. Perchlorate also affects sexual differentiation in zebrafish (Danio rerio), a species in which different strains are reported to have varying or no genetic bases for sex determination [17–19]. In contrast to our findings in stickleback, exposure of zebrafish to perchlorate during early development skews the sex ratio towards female [15], suggesting some species-specific effects of perchlorate on sexual development.Although perchlorate affects sexual differentiation in the stickleback and zebrafish teleost models, the mechanisms underlying the observed effects are unknown. In particular, it is not clear how perchlorate might affect the earliest stages of sexual differentiation, such as initial gonad organogenesis. In this study, we examine whether the earliest known morphological marker of sex determination in stickleback, primordial germ cell (PGC) number, is affected by perchlorate exposure beginning at fertilization. Specifically, we examine whether perchlorate alters sex determination and reproductive development by affecting proliferation or survival of the PGCs during early development. PGC development is one of the first tractable morphological events in vertebrates, occurring by either preformation or epigenesis, with both modes of specification found within teleosts [20].Once they are specified, germ cells undergo several rounds of mitosis [21–23] and then migrate to the site of the presumptive gonad. At this point, the gonad is bipotential, with the capacity to become either ovary or testis. In many teleosts, including stickleback, the germ cells then begin to mitotically divide at a sex specific rate [24]. The underlying genetic signals and morphological changes that transform the bipotential gonads into either ovaries or testes vary widely among species [25]. The first sex-specific event in the developing gonad of many species is a second wave of several rounds of mitosis.Genotypic female stickleback exhibit a larger and earlier second wave of mitosis than males at approximately 15 dpf, which results in three to four times more germ cells [24]. Between 15 and 18 dpf, germ cells in females undergo a round of apoptosis, with females having five times the number of apoptotic germ cells as males [24]. Following meiosis at approximately 18 to 20 dpf, females still have more germ cells than males, although the difference between the sexes is not as dramatic due to the large pre-meiotic apoptosis in the female germ cell population that occurs in the time period leading up to 18 dpf. In addition, the timing of the second wave of mitosis and meiosis of germ cells is earlier in female mammals such as mice [26] and humans [27].This program of germ cell development is common to differentiation during sex determination of the primordial germ line in many teleosts including zebrafish [28–30], as well as in some other vertebrates [27] and represents one of the earliest sex specific, morphologically identifiable events in vertebrate development. For example, PGCs of male mouse embryos enter mitotic arrest at 13.5 dpf, whereas female PGCs continue to proliferate for an additional 24 hours before entering arrest [25, 31]. Intriguingly, when germ cells are ablated in medaka and zebrafish (strain AB) embryos, the modified fish all subsequently develop as males [29, 32, 33] suggesting that a lack of pre-oocyte signaling to the surrounding somatic tissue leads to a testis fate. Transplanting additional germ cells to the gonad reveals that a certain threshold of germ cells must be reached in zebrafish to maintain female identity and for the gonad to develop into an ovary [33]. Mutant zebrafish that develop and reproduce as females can, after germ cell loss at five months due to a mutation in nanos3, become males capable of forming functional sperm [34]. The current hypothesis for this outcome in zebrafish is that meiotic germ cells signal the gonadal somatic cells to maintain expression of aromatase, which converts testosterone to estrogen, causing the gonad to develop into an ovary and the fish to become a female [29, 30, 34, 35]. Reduction in germ cells due to the nanos3 mutation therefore leads to a sex reversal from female to male in these zebrafish. Collectively, these data suggest a hypothesis that in vertebrates timing and magnitude of germ cell mitosis and meiosis, and therefore germ cell number, are critical drivers of reproductive development, including sex determination.Here we use the stickleback fish model to address a potential cellular mechanism by which perchlorate influences reproductive development in vertebrates. We hypothesize that perchlorate exposure affects germ cell proliferation. We predict that the previously documented masculinizing effects of perchlorate exposure early in stickleback development would manifest as fewer germ cells in females, with numbers more similar to those observed in genotypic male stickleback [24]. We tested this hypothesis by exposing stickleback to environmentally relevant concentrations of perchlorate (100 mg/L) [36, 37], and counted premeiotic, meiotic, and total number of germ cells at 16 dpf, the earliest sex-specific difference in morphology in the stickleback gonad [24]. We exposed embryos to perchlorate-treated water from the time of fertilization until 16 dpf and counted germ cell number to test if perchlorate changes the magnitude of the second wave of mitosis. We found that perchlorate exposure decreases primordial germ cell number in female stickleback at 16 dpf, a time when genetic signaling cascades involving germ cell number are important to sex determination. Our findings suggest a cellular mechanism for the patterns of gonadal dysgenesis that we previously reported in perchlorate treated juveniles and adults.Anadromous stickleback were collected from Eel Creek, Oregon (43°35′N; 124°11′W) for parental stock to develop a laboratory line. These collections were covered by Oregon Scientific Take Permit # OR2007-3495, issued by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. The district biologist was contacted and approved of this sampling. No endangered or protected species were encountered during this sampling. However, the limited take of endangered salmonids (if encountered) was covered under the permit mentioned above. All collection, embryo production, and lab rearing methods were approved by the University of Oregon Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Protocol # 10–16. Stickleback were captured using minnow traps, and embryos were created by combining eggs with macerated testes in a Petri dish. Embryos were then transferred back to the lab and reared for multiple generations. All collection, embryo production, and lab rearing methods were approved by the University of Oregon Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Protocol # 10–16. All wild fish sampling procedures were proposed and approved upon applying and being rewarded with the sampling permit. Fish used in this study were the fourth and fifth generation of this line and were fertilized, hatched, and reared using standard crossing protocols [38]. At the onset of this study, fertilized, lab-reared clutches were divided evenly between control and perchlorate-exposure conditions to remove any effects of genetic background. Embryos and fry of all ages were maintained in 6 ppt Instant Ocean (Aquarium Systems, Mentor, OH) added to reverse osmosis water at a constant temperature of 20°C. Embryos and fry were raised under 12:12 light:dark cycle in glass 150 mm Petri dishes at a density of no more than 50 individuals/Petri dish (approximately 100 mL embryo medium), with daily water changes and removal of any dead or sick individuals. Sodium perchlorate hydrate (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added to perchlorate-exposure dishes at a concentration of 100 mg/L (ppm), a concentration previously found to cause reproductive abnormalities in stickleback [6]. Both control and perchlorate treated water were changed daily until the end of the experiment (16dpf). After hatching (around 6 to 7 dpf), fry were fed live Artemia spp. (Inve Aquaculture, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT). Animal care, experimental methods, and euthanasia protocols were approved by the University of Oregon Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Protocol # 10-16R.Thirty stickleback were euthanized at 16 dpf with neutral pH MS222 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and immediately fixed in Bouin’s solution and then placed at 4°C for 48 h. After Bouin’s fixation, fish were serially dehydrated in ETOH washes of increasing concentration, and then stored in 70% ETOH at 4°C. Samples were subsequently paraffin-embedded and sectioned sagittally through the gonad-containing portion of the abdomen to visualize the gonads at 8 μm resolution, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The University of Oregon Histology and Genetic Modification (HGeM) Core Facility performed sectioning and staining.Sagittal sections covered one to five slides (Starfrost) depending upon the size of the fry. Slides containing a 16 dpf fish resulted in approximately 30 sections. In 8 μm thick sections, it is possible to see multiple layers of cells in different focal planes. We counted PGCs at 400-600X under bright field illumination on every section that had visible gonad using a Nikon Eclipse Ti. PGCs were distinguishable by their size, shape, and location within the developing gonad (Fig 1). The entire gonad was sectioned into 10–37 sections, depending on the size of the gonad and the age of the fish. Only PGCs over 5 μm wide were counted and then classified as meiotic or premeiotic, to avoid recounting the same PGC that might span two sections, since the PGCs are spheres and therefore will be smaller than maximum width in consecutive sections. Premeiotic cells were distinguished from meiotic cells using the criteria of Lewis et al. (2008). Specifically, premeiotic cells were identified by size—premeiotic cells are typically twice the size—and by the presence of an un-condensed nucleus with an irregular nuclear membrane. PGC counts were tallied and analyzed based on treatment and sex genotype.Scale bars are 100 microns. White arrows denote location of PGCs within the gonad. At 16 dpf, number of PGCs in control male stickleback (A) were not different than in male stickleback raised in 100 mg/L perchlorate (B). At 16 dpf, however, control female stickleback (C) had more PGCs than females raised in 100 mg/L perchlorate (D).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0157792.g001A standard sex genotyping protocol for stickleback was followed as described previously [39, 40]. Briefly, caudal fin was digested and DNA extracted using Qiagen DNAeasy kits. Primers described by Griffiths et al. 2000 (Primer 1 Forward 5’CTTCTTTCCTCACCATACTCA, Primer 1 Reverse 5’AGATGACGGGTTGATAAACAG) were used to amplify sex specific regions of DNA, and the resulting bands were visualized using standard gel electrophoresis protocols.Analyses of all data were performed using JMP PRO software (2013 SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Means presented are +/- 1 SE. Comparisons of means for PGC number were analyzed using a two factor factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) (effect of perchlorate treatment and sex on germ cell number), followed by Tukey’s HSD post-hoc analysis of means for significant treatment effects, after testing for statistical assumptions. Critical α = 0.05.Pathohistological analysis of serially sectioned abdomens of 16 dpf stickleback revealed easily discernable PGCs in control males (Fig 1A) and females (Fig 1C) that were located in the cavity between the gut and the dorsal skeletal muscle. Female stickleback of this age appeared to have more PGCs in the bipotential gonad than males of the same age (Fig 1A and 1C). For stickleback raised in 100 mg/L perchlorate, females and males appeared to have approximately equal numbers of PGCs in the gonad (Fig 1B and 1D). The histological analysis did not reveal any other gross differences in the developing gonad at these ages between males and females, or between treated and control fish (Fig 1).To confirm histological observations, we counted the number of PGCs in entire gonads. Control 16 dpf males had a mean of 77 +/- 13.9 SE PGCs in the gonad, while control females had a mean of 163 +/- 31.8 SE PGCs (Fig 2A, S1 Data). A two-factor factorial ANOVA overall model effect confirmed a significant effect on PGC number for both sex (F3, 22 = 2.6, P = 0.0165) and perchlorate treatment (F3, 22 = 3.88, P = 0.0008), and a significant interaction effect of the two levels (F3, 22 = 7.23, P = 0.0015). Females exposed to perchlorate from fertilization to 16 dpf had significantly fewer (1/3 as many) total PGCs as control females, but perchlorate did not affect PGC number in males, explaining the interaction between perchlorate treatment and sex factors in the ANOVA model (Fig 2, S1 Data).Number of PGCs (+/-1SE) in 16 dpf genotypic male (solid lines) and female (dotted lines) stickleback, with interaction plots of the total number of PGCs (A), premeiotic PGCs (B), and meiotic cells (C). Asterisk represents significantly different PGC counts (Two-Way ANOVA, Tukey's Post-Hoc Analysis, P< 0.05). n = 12–14.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0157792.g002We categorized germ cells as either premeiotic or meiotic. In control female 16 dpf stickleback, a mean of 142.8 PGCs (88% of total) were premeiotic, while 12% had entered or completed meiosis (Fig 2B, S1 Data). In control male 16 dpf stickleback, a mean of 70.5 PGCs (92% of total) were premeiotic, with the remaining 8% meiotic (Fig 2C, S1 Data). The percent of PGCs that were premeiotic did not change with perchlorate treatment. In perchlorate treated 16 dpf females, a mean of 48.8 PGCs (88%) were premeiotic, and in perchlorate treated 16 dpf males 91% were premeiotic. At 16 dpf, perchlorate treatment results in a significant decline in both premeiotic (F3, 22 = 7.07, P = 0.0017) and meiotic (F3, 22 = 6.98, P = 0.0018) germ cell number only in females.Stickleback are an established model system for testing the effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals relevant to human health [41, 42]. Using this model fish we found that perchlorate significantly reduces PGC number in female stickleback at 16 dpf, an important time in gonad development and possibly sex determination in this species [24]. The reduction in PGC number in genotypic females caused by perchlorate may explain how it masculinizes them, an effect that appears to have lasting consequences to the health and development of the adult fish. Our findings are one of the first reports of an endocrine disrupting contaminant affecting germ cell number in a developing vertebrate, an effect that might occur due to exposure to other contaminants as well. Our findings also underscore the utility of this model fish for ecotoxicology studies, and our results are likely extendible to other vertebrates. PGC number is the first tractable sex specific morphology in the developing gonad of many vertebrates [24, 29, 43, 44] and genetic signaling cascades from the larger number of meiotic germ cells in genotypic females drives female-specific cell fate in many teleosts [29, 30, 45] but interestingly not goldfish [46]. A gene important to male medaka sex determination, Dmrt1bY, inhibits germ cell proliferation, further suggesting that germ cell number during gonad development is closely linked to the sex determination process [43, 47].The absolute numbers of PGCs we count differ from the findings of Lewis et al. (2008), which also examined PGC development in stickleback. In addition, we identify meiotic germ cells in females at 16dpf, as well as a few (5 or less on average) in males at this age (Fig 2). Lewis et al.(23)did not identify meiotic cells in either sex until 18dpf, although in that study no measurements were taken between 15dpf and 18dpf, making direct comparison impossible. In the current study, we examined an anadromous population of stickleback from Eel Creek in Oregon, while Lewis et al. (23 examined two Alaskan populations of stickleback from Rabbit Slough (anadromous) and Bear Paw Lake (resident freshwater). In the anadromous Alaskan population, Lewis et al. [24] counted up to ten times more PGCs in similarly aged fish. However, the resident freshwater population Lewis et al. [24] had PGC numbers more closely matched to the numbers we report here. The similarities and differences in the findings of these two studies raise the interesting possibility of population-specific patterns of germ cell development. Some plausible reasons for the differences between the studies include our use of a conservative quantification rubric to avoid counting the same cell twice, population level differences in developmental trajectories, and environmental factors such as temperature, salinity, and food availability causing different developmental patterns. A multi-population study of patterns of germ cell development across stickleback ecotypes would provide the necessary data to answer these questions. Population-level differences could also be exploited in genetic mapping studies to identify additional genes and pathways important for germ cell development, further underscoring the useful role for threespine stickleback as an evolutionary mutant model [48] for biomedical studies.Our findings suggest that environmental perchlorate exposure early in life may be interfering with reproductive development during sex determination in exposed vertebrates. Germ cell number in carp has also been demonstrated to be affected by exposure to an estrogen mimic [49], but our data are the first to demonstrate an effect of a non-steroidal compound that is commonly found in drinking water sources. Early embryonic exposure to some pollutants causes lasting effects on adult reproductive morphology or performance in vertebrates [50–52] in addition to cancers [53–55] and other pathologies such as immunotoxic effects in the head kidney [56]. Some of these effects are transgenerational [55, 57], and an exciting area of research is on epigenetic mechanisms of inheritance of environmental exposure to pollutants. Perchlorate is well documented to disrupt the function of the thyroid with consequences to the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis [58–60], and perchlorate impacts health and development in ways that go beyond those easily interpretable as mediated via the thyroid. Many pollutants alter reproductive development, including ovarian follicle formation in mice [61], oocyte development in white suckers (Catostomus commersoni) [62], and spermatogenesis in stickleback [6]. The current study is one of the first to examine whether a known endocrine disruptor impacts reproductive development by affecting proliferation or survival of the PGCs prior to meiosis.Although our data show that perchlorate clearly affects PGC number at 16 dpf in female stickleback (Figs 1 and 2), the molecular and physiological mechanisms are as yet unknown. Many pollutants, including perchlorate, cause adult gonad dysgenesis and pathology via effects on hormonal systems. Endocrine disruption by exogenous pollutants can alter gonad size [11, 12, 15], gonad shape [63], and reproductive development and behavior [8, 62]. We previously found that perchlorate masculinizes both adult male and female stickleback[6, 8], leading to the hypothesis that perchlorate can have androgenic effects. In a recent study [6], we found a significant effect of a range of doses of perchlorate on embryonic, larval, and juvenile levels of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT). 11-KT is a key androgen in teleost fishes for stimulating male reproductive physiology [64, 65], and is synthesized from testosterone. Changes in embryonic 11-KT levels occurred within hours of perchlorate exposure [6]. Changes in the steroid environment in the embryo based on perchlorate exposure is therefore a possible mechanistic explanation for our finding in the current study that PGC number is reduced in perchlorate-treated females, but not in males. In tilapia, steroid-producing cells congregate near the differentiating germ cells, suggesting that steroids perform a role in the process of germ cell differentiation [66]. Androgens contribute to germ cell determination and follicular atresia in mice [67, 68]. Exposure of mice to environmental estrogens increases the occurrence of follicles containing multiple oocytes, which is a marker of disrupted germ cell development [61].These results are consistent with the hypothesis that perchlorate disrupts PGC development by altering embryonic steroid levels (Fig 2). Perchlorate could reduce total PGC number in females by either reducing proliferation (mitosis) or by increasing the rate of cell death (apoptosis). Future studies should test these hypotheses using molecular markers of proliferation and apoptosis in perchlorate-treated and control fish. Quantifying PGC number across a span of development would be an important experiment to address these possibilities. Critical time periods of exposure have been detected for endocrine disrupting compounds, usually early in embryonic development [53, 69]. Chemical exposure is thought to explain numerous adult-onset human diseases [70, 71]. By 16 dpf, the second round of PGC mitosis has already occurred in stickleback, and females have measurably more PGCs than males. By 18 dpf, PGCs in control stickleback are entering into meiosis and differentiating into male or female reproductive cells, and between 16 and 18 dpf female stickleback experience a 5-fold increase in apoptotic cells, reducing germ cell number to a level close to that of males [24]. Our data suggest that perchlorate exerts effects on early stages of germ cell development, resulting in reproductive pathologies in adults [6, 10, 12].Perchlorate is a widespread aquatic contaminant in certain countries such as the United States, where nearly every person has measurable levels of perchlorate in their urine [72]. Here we demonstrate that perchlorate has effects on reproductive development by significantly reducing PGC number in female stickleback at 16 dpf, an important period of germ cell development and proliferation. Future studies should determine the mechanism by which perchlorate reduces PGC number, and whether this effect is widespread across vertebrates and therefore has implications for wildlife reproductive health. Because of the conservation of many aspects of germ cell production across vertebrates, our findings may also have significant implications for human health. In humans, disruption of endocrine function during early developmental windows can cause adult-onset diseases [73]. Our findings support the ‘developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis’ (DOHaD), which suggests that some adult human diseases arise from prenatal exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds [70, 74]. Our findings are likely applicable to the wide array of vertebrates in which germ cell number is an important early indicator of sex determination, including other teleosts and mammals. Environmental contaminants can cause primordial sexual dysgenesis in humans and may contribute to widespread diseases such as polycystic ovarian syndrome and breast cancer [74, 75]. Studies of model organisms such as stickleback have the potential to help in understanding–and eventually mitigating–these effects, by offering insights into mechanisms of action of contaminants that lead to pathology.Raw counts of primordial germ cells in 16dpf threespine stickleback from Oregon.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0157792.s001(XLSX)We thank Poh Kheng Loi for expertise in histology preparations, and Ruth Bremiller, Yi-Lin Yan, and Catherine Wilson for helpful discussion and technical expertise.

Apoptosis has also been proposed to play a crucial role in zebrafish gonad differentiation. Nevertheless, the interactions between EDCs and apoptosis have received little attention.Thus, this study aimed to assess if and which apoptotic pathways are involved in zebrafish gonad differentiation and how EDCs may interfere with this process. With these purposes, zebrafish were exposed to 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2, 4 ng/L) and fadrozole (Fad, 50 μg/L) from 2 h to 35 days post-fertilization (dpf). Afterwards, a gene expression analysis by qRT-PCR and a stereological analysis, based on systematic sampling and protein immunohistochemistry, were performed. The death receptors (FAS; TRADD), anti-apoptotic (BCL-2; MDM2), pro-apoptotic (CASP-2 and −6) and cell proliferation (BIRC5/survivin; JUN) genes and proteins were evaluated. In general, apoptosis was inhibited in females through the involvement of anti-apoptotic pathways, while in males apoptosis seemed to be crucial to the failure of the “juvenile ovary” development and the induction of testes transformation. The JUN protein was shown to be necessary in juvenile ovaries, while the BIRC5 protein seemed to be involved in zebrafish spermatogenesis. Both EDCs, EE2 and Fad, increased the apoptosis stimulus in zebrafish gonad. It was noticed that the few females that were resistant to Fad-induced sex reversal had increased anti-apoptotic factor levels, while males exposed to EE2 showed increased pro-apoptotic genes/proteins and were more advanced in gonad differentiation. Overall, our findings show that apoptosis pathways are involved in zebrafish gonad differentiation and that EDCs can disrupt this process.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Although many sex-determining genes and pathways are conserved, the mechanistic roles of these genes and pathways in the genetic sex determination are not well understood. DAX1 (encoded by the NR0B1 gene) is a vertebrate specific orphan nuclear receptor that regulates gonadal development and sexual determination. In human, duplication of the NR0B1 gene leads to male-to-female sex reversal. In mice, Nr0b1 shows both pro-testis and anti-testis functions. We generated inheritable nr0b1 mutation in the zebrafish and found the nr0b1 mutation caused homozygous mutants to develop as fertile males due to female-to-male sex reversal. The nr0b1 mutation did not increase Caspase-3 labeling nor tp53 expression in the developing gonads. Introduction of a tp53 mutation into the nr0b1 mutant did not rescue the sex-reversal phenotype. Further examination revealed reduction in cell proliferation and abnormal somatic cell differentiation in the nr0b1 mutant gonads at the undifferentiated and bi-potential ovary stages. Together, our results suggest nr0b1 regulates somatic cell differentiation and cell proliferation to ensure normal sex development in the zebrafish.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Due to seasonal changes and variable industrial and agricultural activities it often occurs intermittently. Thus, it is possible that aquatic organisms may be more affected by periodic peak exposure than by chronic exposure. Therefore, an experimental scenario including an exposure from 2 h to 90 days post-fertilization (dpf) and a subsequent recovery period until 150 dpf was chosen to assess the potential reversibility of the effects of sex steroids on sexual and gonad development of zebrafish (Danio rerio). The aim of this study was to investigate the persistence of the endocrine effects of an estrogen (EE2-17α-ethinylestradiol, 4 ng/L), an inhibitor of estrogen synthesis (Fad-fadrozole, 50 μg/L) or their binary mixture (Mix-EE2+ Fad, 4 ng/L + 50 μg/L). Afterwards, a semi-quantitative histological assessment was used to investigate histopathological changes on gonad differentiation and development. The data showed that fadrozole, alone or in combination with EE2, permanently disrupts the sexual development, inducing masculinization and causing severe pathological alterations in testis, such as intersex associated to the enlargement of sperm ducts, interstitial changes, asynchronous development and detachment of basal membrane. After exposures to both EDCs and their mixture, the gonad histopathology revealed interstitial proteinaceous fluid deposits and, in ovaries, there were atretic oocytes, and presumably degenerative mineralization. On the other hand, the gonadal changes induced by EE2 alone seem to be partially reversible when the exposure regime changed to a recovery period. In addition, EE2 enhanced zebrafish growth in both genders, with male fish presenting signs of early obesity such as the presence of adipocytes in testis. Moreover, sex ratio was slightly skewed toward females, at 90 and 105 dpf, in zebrafish exposed to EE2. The data further indicate that long-term studies on impacts of single EDCs and their mixtures with recovery periods are crucial to reveal the possibility of sex reversal and pathological changes of gonads that can adversely affect breeding.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

However, the proximate effects of sex-role reversal are largely unknown. Endocrine disruptors provide an experimental mechanism to address hormonal regulation of sexually dimorphic gene expression in sex-role-reversed taxa. Here, we investigate gene expression patterns in the liver of the sex-role-reversed Gulf pipefish, because the liver is known to be sexually dimorphic and estrogen-regulated in species with conventional sex roles. Using next-generation RNA-sequencing technology (RNA-seq), we detected sexually dimorphic hepatic gene expression patterns, with a total of 482 differentially expressed genes between the sexes in Gulf pipefish. Two-thirds of these genes were over-expressed in females, and the sex-specific transcriptomes of this sex-role-reversed pipefish’s liver were superficially similar to those of fishes with conventional sex-roles. We exposed females, pregnant males, and non-pregnant males to 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) at ecologically relevant concentrations of 5ng/L and compared gene expression patterns in the livers of exposed fish to control fish. Several genes that were up-regulated in EE2-exposed males relative to control males were also found to be female-biased in control animals. These genes included several of the classic estrogen biomarkers, such as vitellogenin, choriogenin, and zona pellucida. Thus, estrogen exposure induced feminization of the male liver transcriptome in a sex-role-reversed pipefish. These results suggest that the ancestral state of estrogen-regulated female reproductive physiology has been retained in all sex-role-reversed vertebrates thus far studied, despite substantial evolution of the hormonal regulation of ornamentation and mating behavior in these interesting taxa.Citation: Rose E, Flanagan SP, Jones AG (2015) The Effects of Synthetic Estrogen Exposure on the Sexually Dimorphic Liver Transcriptome of the Sex-Role-Reversed Gulf Pipefish.

In the sexual selection literature, sex-role reversal is usually defined as the situation in which sexual selection acts more strongly on females than on males [1], and it is normally associated with substantial parental investment by males [2], which reduces the male potential reproductive rate below that of the female [3,4]. Sex-role-reversed species have provided unique opportunities to study sexual selection, because they have allowed novel tests of hypotheses related to mating competition and have challenged ideas related to the meaning of maleness and femaleness. While sex-role-reversed mating systems are quite rare in most taxonomic groups, sex-role reversal has nevertheless been documented in fishes, amphibians, birds, and insects (reviewed in [5]). Work over the last several decades has elucidated many of the ultimate mechanisms responsible for the evolution of sex-role reversal, such as effects of parental investment on the operational sex ratio, the environmental potential for polygamy, and the Bateman gradient [4,6,7]. However, many of the proximate effects of sex-role reversal are not well understood, even though we know that the evolution of sex-role reversal is accompanied by potentially dramatic changes in morphology, behavior, and reproductive physiology.The phenotypic manifestations of sex-role reversal include traits such as showy ornaments and increased aggression in females, as well as marked mating preferences in males [8]. In addition, sex-role-reversed species also often have adaptations associated with male parental investment [9]. Many of these obvious external features might be expected to be accompanied by underlying metabolic or physiological changes [5,10]. Because the traits associated with sex-role reversal tend to be sexually dimorphic, their expression should be encoded by genetic pathways that are connected to the sex-determination hierarchy. While little is known about the mechanisms underlying the genetic basis of sexual dimorphism, previous studies have shown that genes on the sex chromosomes and genes regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, such as growth hormone (GH), are often involved in regulating size dimorphisms [11]. In vertebrates, such connections involve sex hormones, so most of the studies aimed at understanding proximate mechanisms regulating sex-role-reversed morphology and behavior have focused on the endocrinology of sex-role reversal, with a particular emphasis on birds [5,12].The endocrinology of sex-role-reversed species has perhaps generated more questions than answers. One general pattern is that female maturation and cycles of gamete production are controlled by estrogens, whereas male primary sexual traits are controlled by androgens, in much the same way as reproduction is controlled in species with conventional sex roles [5,10]. However, efforts to pin down the proximate causes of female-specific morphology and behavior in sex-role-reversed taxa have revealed a complex picture that appears to vary among taxa. For instance, in most species of sex-role-reversed birds, males have higher testosterone levels than females [13], but there is some indication that testosterone levels nevertheless modulate female aggression, perhaps because certain regions of the female brain are more sensitive to androgens compared to the male brain [14]. On the other hand, in some sex-role-reversed birds, such as barred buttonquails and moorhens, males and females exhibit similar plasma levels of testosterone [15,16], so general patterns regarding testosterone’s role have yet to emerge. In addition, hormones other than testosterone have been implicated in sex-role reversal in birds. For example, progesterone modulates female aggression in the black coucal [17], and males have higher prolactin levels than females in spotted sandpipers [18] and Wilson’s phalarope [19], a reversal of the levels normally observed in species with conventional sex roles. Few studies have been conducted on the endocrinology of non-avian sex-role-reversed species, but what little work has been done indicates a complex picture in these other taxa as well. For instance, in sex-role-reversed populations of the peacock blenny (a marine fish), estradiol and prostaglandin F2α are involved in female courtship displays and mating behavior [20]. In short, the endocrinology of sex-role reversal appears to be complex and remains poorly understood.One noticeable void in the study of proximate mechanisms of sex-role reversal exists in the realm of transcriptome-level responses of sexually dimorphic tissues to hormonal manipulation. Here we begin to fill this gap by studying the transcriptome of the Gulf pipefish (Syngnathus scovelli) liver exposed to the potent endocrine disruptor 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2). We chose to study the Gulf pipefish because it has become an excellent model for the study of many aspects sex-role reversal, and it is an emerging model in the realm of sex-role-reversed endocrinology [10]. Several important features of the liver motivated us to focus on this organ, rather than other obvious choices such as the gonads or male brood pouch, for this initial analysis of transcriptome-level sexual dimorphism and response to an environmental estrogen. First, unlike testes and ovaries, the liver is present in both males and females, facilitating a meaningful comparison of transcriptomes between the sexes. Second, livers in general have been shown to be sexually dimorphic [21,22,23], and in fish the liver in particular plays a major role in reproduction, as many important egg proteins are produced in the liver and transported to the eggs in females. Third, several important liver genes, such as vitellogenin and zona pellucida isoforms, are known to be estrogen dependent [24] and thus provide clear expectations regarding changes in expression levels in response to elevated levels of estrogenic compounds.Studies regarding the effects of environmental estrogens in Gulf pipefish and its close relatives provide context for the present study. In particular, we know that external female morphology is estrogen-dependent, because exposure of male Gulf pipefish to 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) results in the development of female-like secondary sexual traits [25,26]. In addition, expression of vitellogenin has been shown to be induced by estradiol or EE2 in four pipefish species and a seahorse, Syngnathus acus, S. scovelli, S. abaster, Hippocampus guttulatus (also known as H. ramulosus) and Nerophis lumbriciformis [25,27,28], indicating that this gene is estrogen-regulated in syngnathid fishes. Sufficiently high levels of EE2 (above about 5 ng/L) prevent males from developing a functional brood pouch and consequently cause complete reproductive failure [26,29]. This observation is consistent with other data from unpublished dissertation work, which indicates that the male brood pouch is androgen-dependent (reviewed in [10]). However, thus far no evidence suggests that EE2-exposed males adopt female-typical courtship behavior [28], so the proximate mechanisms of sex-role reversal in pipefish seem to mirror those of avian taxa in terms of complexity. As a first step toward understanding transcriptome-level responses to hormone manipulation in a sex-role-reversed pipefish, we used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to characterize the liver transcriptomes of female, pregnant male, and non-pregnant male Gulf pipefish exposed to the potent endocrine disruptor EE2. Our first goal was to examine patterns of sexual dimorphism in liver gene expression in non-exposed control animals to identify genes displaying sexual dimorphism or responsiveness to male pregnancy status. We hypothesized that genes involved directly in egg production would show much higher levels of expression in females than in males, but we also recognized the possibility that constraints imposed by male pregnancy could result in the production of additional compounds in the livers of either males or females. For example, if females package additional proteins in their eggs to function during post-copulatory processes, potentially occurring within the male’s brood pouch, or if males provision their offspring, then some important proteins involved in these processes could conceivably be produced in the livers of either sex.Our second goal was to quantify gene expression changes in the liver in response to estrogen exposure in females, pregnant males, and non-pregnant males. We hypothesized that the general pattern of expression changes would be toward feminization of male livers. However, if multiple endocrine signaling pathways have been altered to different degrees by the evolution of sex-role reversal, then we might expect an intermediate pattern, in which some genes are very strongly affected by EE2 while others are relatively resistant even though they are nevertheless sexually dimorphic in their expression patterns. We further assessed whether our observed gene expression patterns are sex-role reversed by comparing our results to those from the zebrafish (Danio rerio), a model organism with conventional sex roles.The RNA-seq results identified a total of 482 Trinity gene transcripts that were significantly differentially expressed in the control female livers compared to the livers of control pregnant and non-pregnant males, with a false-discovery-rate corrected p ≤ 0.05. Of these 482 differentially expressed transcripts, 67% were up-regulated in females (325 contigs) and the remaining 33% showed higher expression levels in males (157 contigs) (S1 Table). The gene ontology analyses in Blast2GO identified two biological processes, cellular process and metabolic process, as being the most common in the control female liver transcripts. These two processes accounted for 22 and 19 percent, respectively, of the biological processes represented in the annotated sequences (S1 Table).Of the 325 up-regulated transcripts in females, a total of 21 genes showed an over-expression of 20 fold or higher compared to males (Table 1). These over-expressed genes included several known female-specific genes, such as vitellogenin b and c, choriogenin h, and zona pellucida sperm-binding protein 4-like, which have all been shown to be involved in egg development and maturation [30,31,32]. In addition to the female-specific genes, estrogen receptor alpha (esr1) was also highly up-regulated in control females. Several of the genes with the largest differences in expression levels, such as extracellular serine threonine kinase fam 20c-like (Fam20c), were labeled as “cellular response to estrogen stimulus” genes in the Blast2GO analysis. Many of these strongly sexually dimorphic genes have also been shown to have female-biased hepatic expression profiles, particularly in response to estrogen exposure [33]. Examples include 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase (hmgcra), methylsterol monooxygenase 1(msmo1), and lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase-like (CYP51A1), in addition to the aforementioned female-specific genes. Of the 157 genes that were up-regulated in males, only one transcript, histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 3-like (hint3, S1 Table), exhibited a greater than 20-fold difference in expression levels between males and females.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0139401.t001A comparison of the transcripts between the sexes by absolute number of reads showed that 46 of the top 50 expressed genes were shared between the two sexes (Table 2). Females had four genes within their 50 highest expressed transcripts that were not included within the males’ top 50, including transcripts for a translationally controlled tumor protein and three egg proteins: vitellogenin b, zona pellucida sperm-binding protein 4-like, and chorion protein. The males also had four genes that were found solely in the list of 50 top expressed genes for males but not females. These genes included pancreatic elastase, coagulation factor VIIb precursor, fibrinogen alpha chain-like, and a hypothetical unknown protein gene.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0139401.t002Restricting attention to sexually dimorphic genes, we found that control pregnant males and non-pregnant males had very similar patterns of gene expression to one another that were quite distinct from those of females (Fig 1). This observation supports the hypothesis that both pregnant and non-pregnant males have a male-like gene expression pattern that differs drastically from that of females. A comparison of gene expression between control pregnant and control non-pregnant males showed that 41 genes were differentially expressed between these categories of males. Of these 41 transcripts, two genes (contig c58371_g3_i3 and cornifelin homolog b-like) were upregulated by greater than 20 fold in pregnant males, and one gene (cartilage acidic acid 2) was upregulated greater than 20-fold in non-pregnant males (S2 Table).Heat map showing hierarchical clustering of mean expression values for the six treatments including control females, pregnant males, and non-pregnant males, as well as EE2 exposed females, pregnant males, and non-pregnant males, for all genes which showed sexually dimorphic expression patterns in control fish. The colors of the bars represent either up-regulated (red) or down-regulated (blue) genes. The male treatments cluster together with the exception of the EE2 exposed pregnant males which cluster with the both control and EE2 females.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0139401.g001After one week of exposure to 5ng/L EE2, both the pregnant and non-pregnant males’ gene expression patterns demonstrated a clear response to estrogen and showed signs of feminization (Fig 1). Non-pregnant males exhibited a greater response to EE2 exposure than did pregnant males, with a total of 182 genes differentially expressed (112 up-regulated and 70 down-regulated) in EE2-exposed non-pregnant males relative to control non-pregnant males (Fig 2, S3 Table). We detected only 37 differentially expressed gene transcripts in exposed pregnant males relative to control pregnant males (24 up-regulated and 13 down-regulated; Fig 2, S4 Table). Two of the genes up-regulated in exposed non-pregnant males, but not in exposed pregnant males, were contig c58371_g3_i3 and cornifelin homolog b-like, which also were up-regulated in control pregnant males (S3 Table, S4 Table). A subset of nine genes was up-regulated in control females (relative to control males), EE2-exposed pregnant males (compared to control pregnant males) and EE2-exposed non-pregnant males (relative to control non-pregnant males). These loci included cathepsin e-like (a liver-specific aspartic proteinase), extracellular serine threonine protein kinase fam20c-like, and choriogenin h, among others (Table 3; Fig 2). Among the subset of nine genes showing both female biased expression and EE2 responsiveness in exposed males, nearly half of these genes were known egg-associated loci, such as vitellogenin b and c, choriogenin h and l, and zona pellucida sperm-binding protein 4-like (Table 3), which are normally expressed at high levels in females only. A comparison of exposed pregnant males to exposed non-pregnant males revealed one gene that was upregulated greater than 20-fold in pregnant males (contig c59977_g1_i1) and two genes that were upregulated greater than 20-fold in non-pregnant males (enolase-phosphatase E1-like and fibrous sheath CABYR-binding protein-like; S5 Table).Venn diagram of control females (CF), EE2 exposed pregnant males (EP), and non-pregnant males (ENP) to show overlap of female biased genes and EE2 responsive genes. Gene expression levels for control females are either over or under expressed compared to the levels of expression in control males, and EE2 exposed male genes were differentially expressed from their control counterparts. A list of genes up-regulated between all three groups can be found in Table 3.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0139401.g002https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0139401.t003The livers of EE2-exposed females did not show a pattern of increased feminization relative to livers of control females. Rather, we saw expression patterns respond in the opposite direction. A total of 20 genes were found to be sexually dimorphic in control fish and also differentially expressed between EE2-exposed and control females (Table 4). Eighteen of these 20 transcripts showed a pattern in which the effects of EE2 exposure in female livers were of opposite sign compared to the pattern of sexual dimorphism. For instance, genes that were upregulated in female control fish relative to male controls were usually downregulated in EE2-exposed females relative to control females. However, these effects were relatively small (Table 4), and no transcripts showed a greater than 20-fold expression difference in females as a result of EE2 exposure (S6 Table).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0139401.t004A principal components analysis (S1 Fig) shows a clear separation of control males and females, regardless of female exposure status. The top loadings for PC1, which explains 49-percent of the variation, include vitellogenin b, warm temperature acclimation-related 65 kDa protein, and ribosomal protein 40s 18s, indicating that PC1 captures variation in some of the genes with the largest sex biases in expression. Exposed pregnant males fall between the females and the rest of the males (S1 Fig). Overall, the first three principal components account for 85 percent of the variation, with three of the top genes that represent the highest loadings in PC1 also listing in the top loadings for PC2 and PC3. Restricting attention to the sexually dimorphic genes, we see a general trend for males to become feminized in their gene expression patterns as a result of EE2 exposure (Fig 1). The grouping of EE2-exposed pregnant males with females in Fig 1 and S1 Fig indicates that exposure to synthetic estrogen makes pregnant male livers more female-like than it does to non-pregnant male livers. However, this observation should be interpreted in light of our previous result that EE2 affects the expression patterns of more genes in non-pregnant male livers relative to pregnant male livers.We found that the majority of the sex-biased genes in zebrafish and pipefish did not overlap, with only nine female-biased genes shared between non-exposed females of the two species (Fig 3A). In the comparison of the down-regulated genes in females, only four were shared between non-exposed zebrafish and pipefish (Fig 3B). Most of the genes that were up-regulated in males of either species in response to EE2 exposure were also female-biased genes (63 of 84 genes in zebrafish males and 11 of 13 genes with 20-fold or higher expression changes in pipefish). The only genes that were female-biased in both species and up-regulated in EE2-exposed males of both species were vitellogenin 2/vitellogenin b and vitellogenin3/vitellogenin c. When only sexually-dimorphic genes were considered, pipefish males had more genes that were down-regulated than up-regulated in response to EE2 exposure, which was the opposite pattern observed in zebrafish males. Although some of the genes that were down-regulated as a result of EE2 exposure were female-biased (14 of 51 in pipefish and 10 of 57 in zebrafish), the majority were not. In fact, most EE2 responsive, down-regulated genes in zebrafish were male-biased (38 of 57). However, in pipefish, only 11 of 51 down-regulated genes were male-biased.Venn diagrams of sexually dimorphic and EE2 responsive genes for pipefish and zebrafish showing EE2 up-regulated genes in 3a and EE2 down-regulated genes in 3b. Numbers of female biased genes in control females are presented for control pipefish females in this study (PF) and for control zebrafish from a study by [23]. (ZF). Male EE2 responsive genes are presented for both pregnant and non-pregnant, EE2 exposed pipefish males (PM) and for EE2 exposed males from [23](ZM).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0139401.g003This first study of the effects of a potent endocrine disruptor on gene expression patterns in a sex-role-reversed organism shows that the liver of the Gulf pipefish is markedly sexually dimorphic and responds very strongly to an estrogenic compound. For instance, several female-biased genes respond to EE2 exposure in males in a direction indicative of feminization of the male liver transcriptome. Control fish follow a pattern predicted by the hypothesis that both pregnant and non-pregnant males should differ from females in terms of expression patterns as a consequence of the major role of the liver in producing egg-related proteins. Our results also show that fish exposed to synthetic estrogen show expression patterns consistent with the idea that, even in sex-role-reversed species, female-biased liver genes should be regulated by estrogen. In particular, we see a shift toward more feminine patterns of gene expression in males exposed to EE2. Some aspects of our analysis raise the intriguing possibility that the liver plays a role in not only female reproduction but also male reproduction, as sperm-related transcripts occur in the liver, an observation that leads to the hypothesis that males may also be capable of transporting proteins from the liver to the brood pouch. In addition, as we will explain below, we believe our results leave the door open for sexual selection to act on genes expressed in the liver that ultimately play a role in postcopulatory sexual selection or sexual conflict.Sex-role-reversed organisms represent an evolutionary challenge from an endocrinology perspective [5,10], because the females must evolve nuptial ornaments and competitive mating behavior, possibly including enhanced aggression, while simultaneously preserving female reproductive cycles and primary sexual traits. All of these traits related to reproduction and mating competition are potentially sexually dimorphic and hormonally regulated. All sex-role-reversed vertebrates evolved from ancestral taxa with conventional sex roles, and in such taxa androgens (e.g., testosterone or 11-ketotestosterone) are the main hormones involved in almost every aspect of male reproductive competition from the development of primary sexual traits to the modulation of secondary sexual traits and mating behavior [34,35]. Consequently, a male can conceivably become more ornamented or more aggressive during contests for mates by increasing testosterone levels without impairing the male’s ability to produce gametes, although testosterone does have other costs [36]. In sex-role-reversed species, in contrast, a female competing for mates cannot increase her competitive ability simply by increasing testosterone levels without suppressing normal female reproduction, so the evolution of sex-role reversal must have involved mechanisms to circumvent this constraint [5,10]. The diagnosis of these mechanisms has been difficult and remains a work in progress, so we discuss in turn three aspects of female reproduction, namely reproductive physiology, female ornamentation, and female mating behavior, in light of our results and the broader literature on the endocrinology of sex-role reversal.Our study is most relevant to female reproductive physiology and indeed represents the first dataset addressing transcriptome-wide effects of hormone manipulation in any reproduction-related tissue from a sex-role-reversed species. Our results provide the first evidence that the pipefish liver shows genome-wide patterns of dimorphism, with hundreds of genes differentially expressed between males and females. Some transcripts, such as vitellogenin b and vitellogenin c, showed greater than 1000-fold higher levels of expression in females compared to males. Our EE2 results establish that these expression patterns are largely estrogen-regulated, because males exposed to EE2 expressed genes that were normally only found at high levels in females. Estrogen profiles have been studied in other sex-role-reversed taxa, notably birds, and in general results show that estradiol profiles are similar to non-sex-role-reversed birds [37,38,39]. The emerging pattern is that estrogens control reproductive physiology in females of sex-role-reversed species in much the same way as in females of species with conventional sex roles. Hence, our data are consistent with an emerging pattern that many sexually dimorphic traits are regulated by the hypothalamic-gonadal-pituitary axis [11].The situation becomes more confusing when we turn attention to ornamentation in sex-role-reversed taxa. In pipefish, female secondary sexual traits occur in males exposed to EE2, suggesting that female ornamentation is controlled by estrogens [25,26,28]. However, the pattern is markedly different in sex-role-reversed birds. In Wilson’s phalaropes, moorhens and barred buttonquails, injection of females with testosterone increases the brightness of their ornamentation [15,16,40]. Thus, secondary sexual characteristics in these species seem to be affected more by androgens than by estrogens. In other sex-role-reversed marine fishes, such as the peacock blenny and the two-spotted goby, neither estrogens nor androgens seem to be responsible for female nuptial coloration, suggesting an altogether different mechanism could be at work [20,41]). In short, sex-role-reversed females seem to have evolved many disparate mechanisms to modulate nuptial coloration, and pipefish may provide a particularly tractable model because EE2 exposure alone is sufficient to produce female-specific secondary sexual traits in males.Perhaps the most interesting and demanding area of research in the realm of sex-role-reversed endocrinology concerns the modulation of female behaviors involved in mating competition, and researchers have thus far only scratched the surface of this difficult topic. Almost no work has addressed this topic in the family Syngnathidae, but one study [28] and our anecdotal observations indicate that EE2 exposure does not cause males to adopt female-specific courtship behavior, which in Gulf pipefish includes a striking change in coloration, dancing and twitching [42]. Thus, the proximate factors involved in sex-specific mating behaviors in syngnathids remain unknown. As noted above (see Introduction), the waters are equally muddy for other sex-role-reversed taxa. In particular, testosterone, progesterone, estradiol, and prostaglandins have possible roles in modulating female behavior in various sex-role-reversed taxa [5,17,20]. The endocrinology of mating behavior in sex-role-reversed taxa should be a high priority for research, as many interesting surprises no doubt await us, and syngnathid fishes provide a model uniquely suited to this research endeavor.In many ways, the Gulf pipefish liver transcriptome behaves in a similar fashion to those of the few other fish species studied in this regard. In control fish, pregnant and non-pregnant males shared more similar gene expression patterns than either group shared with females, and both groups of males responded in a female-like manner to synthetic estrogen. The most telling result is that genes involved in egg production are highly upregulated in females relative to males, a typical pattern in the livers of fish species with conventional sex roles. In addition, some of the most highly expressed genes in the livers of females also encode egg-related proteins and EE2 exposure induces expression of these genes in males.However, at face value, our patterns of gene expression look quite different from those observed in zebrafish [23], with only a few genes occurring on both species’ top-50 lists with regard to expression levels. Similarly, only a handful of genes show similar, statistically significant responses to EE2 in both species. Nevertheless, the overall theme that egg-related protein genes are upregulated in females and that estrogen exposure feminizes male livers appears in both the Gulf pipefish and zebrafish datasets [23]. In addition, the zebrafish study identified a marked up-regulation of ribosomal genes in female livers, and while these genes did not appear on our list of extremely sexually dimorphic loci, many ribosomal genes did appear on our complete list of statistically significant sexually dimorphic genes (S1 Table). Many of the differences between our study and the zebrafish study could be a consequence of differences in experimental design. The zebrafish study used E2 rather than EE2, used a much higher concentration of sex hormones (1000-fold higher), pooled individuals within a treatment before sequencing, and provided some evidence that their males had already been exposed to endocrine disruptors before their use in the experiment [23]. Other studies involving zebrafish [43], yellow perch [44], and turbot [45] show patterns that are broadly consistent with our results, although the precise genes involved often differ considerably among datasets.Another intriguing result from our analysis is that the low doses of EE2 used in our study resulted in masculinization of the female liver. This pattern is evident from our observation that 90 percent of sexually dimorphic genes showed expression changes in opposition to the pattern of sexual dimorphism in exposed females (i.e., their expression became more male-like). At face value, this observation might be interpreted as evidence that the female liver transcriptome is sex-role-reversed with respect to its response to estrogens. However, this sort of pattern has been observed in other taxa without sex-role reversal [33,46], and the most likely explanation is simply that too much estrogen causes females to begin to shut down reproduction. Thus, this observation also seems to indicate that the pipefish liver is very much like that of other fish without sex-role reversal.One interesting possibility, which is hinted at by our data but not definitively supported by any of our analyses, is that the liver somehow plays a role in sexual selection in sex-role-reversed pipefish. The female liver produces egg-related proteins, which are transported to the ovaries, processed and packaged in the eggs. In sex-role-reversed species, females typically have greater potential reproductive rates than males, which can result in pre- and postcopulatory competition among females for mating and reproductive success. Hence, female-specific genes in the liver controlling egg production could be under stronger sexual selection in females of sex-role-reversed species compared to related species with less mating competition among females, such as monogamous pipefishes and seahorses. Another plausible hypothesis is that other proteins produced by the liver are also transported to the female’s reproductive tract and eventually transferred to the male during mating. Even though most studies of reproductive protein evolution focus on the gonads, the liver may be a neglected organ with an underappreciated role in postcopulatory processes. Interestingly, our data also show that some sperm-related proteins in males are produced in the liver, so males also could experience selection on genes expressed in the liver whose products are ultimately transported to the gonads or brood pouch. This idea remains speculative at the moment, but we feel that the role of the liver in postcopulatory processes, especially in sex-role-reversed organisms, is a topic that deserves further exploration.Syngnathid fishes are potentially useful for the study of endocrine disruptors in marine environments, because many pipefishes and seahorses occur in shallow coastal waters throughout the world [47]. Furthermore, many syngnathids, including the Gulf pipefish, lack a pelagic dispersal phase, so most individuals probably complete their lifecycle near their birthplace. Thus, pipefish have the potential to serve as sentinel species for endocrine disruptors in the marine realm. Other work has shown that vitellogenin is upregulated in EE2-exposed pipefish males [25,28]. Our results provide a number of other potential genes that could serve as biomarkers of environmental estrogens in male or female pipefish, although males seem to be the best choice for unambiguous evidence of endocrine disruption. One key feature of our study is that we used environmentally relevant concentrations of EE2 (5 ng/L). Studies of EE2 in contaminated bodies of water have revealed levels of EE2 in the range of 30–50 ng/L and even as high as 820 ng/L in some places [48,49,50]. Hence, gene expression changes in pipefish livers could provide a sensitive method for the preliminary screening of sites with a high risk of deleterious impacts from endocrine-disrupting contaminants.Our results provide an important advance in the endocrinology of sex-role-reversed vertebrates. In particular we found that the pipefish liver is sexually dimorphic and estrogen regulated, suggesting that female reproductive physiology is regulated by estrogens in pipefish in much the same way as in fish without sex-role reversal. In light of other work on sex-role-reversed taxa, primarily birds, this result suggests that the ancestral mechanism of hormonal control of female reproductive physiology has been retained across sex-role-reversed vertebrates. However, a survey of the literature shows that secondary sexual traits are controlled by a variety of mechanisms, and pipefish are somewhat unusual in that estrogens induce female ornaments in males. Finally, sex-role-reversed mating behaviors remain a mystery, as their proximate modulation has not yet been resolved in any sex-role-reversed taxon. Our results also provide novel pipefish transcripts that respond to endocrine disruptors, which could be extremely useful for screening coastal marine habitats for environmental estrogens. In short, this study provides novel insights into sexual dimorphism and hormonal regulation of gene expression patterns in the pipefish liver, setting the stage for future studies regarding the endocrinology of sex-role-reversed mating behavior in this interesting marine fish.Gulf pipefish were collected from Redfish Bay near Aransas Pass, Texas (N 27 53 39.07, W 97 7 51.69) on July 8th, 2013 under the Texas Parks and Wildlife permit number SPR-0808-307. This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Texas A&M University (Animal Use Protocol # 2013–0020, Reference #001898) and fish were killed using an overdose of MS-222. We collected only pregnant males and females with well-developed iridescent bands, ensuring that all individuals were sexually mature. Males were allowed to give birth before being used in the experiment. Fish were dipped in freshwater for ten minutes to remove any external parasites and then acclimated to 26-ppt salinity tanks at Texas A&M University. The 17α-ethinylestradiol powder, of 98% purity, was acquired from Sigma (#SLBF2546V) and dissolved in 200-proof ethanol from Sigma (#SHBD6226V). All tanks held 7 liters of water and were initially dosed with 50 μl of either a 7ng/10μl stock EE2 ethanol solution to have tank concentrations of 5ng/L EE2 or 50 μl of ethanol without EE2 for the controls. The chosen concentration of 5 ng/L EE2 was selected because it is within the range of EE2 found in contaminated bodies of water in nature and also because long-term exposure to this concentration has been shown to cause entire breeding populations of some fish species to collapse [49,51,52]. Ten percent water changes were completed daily to ensure that EE2 concentrations remained at a constant 5ng/L as established by [26].To generate each pregnant male, we placed one non-pregnant male and one female together in a clean, EE2-free saltwater tank until the male became pregnant. Each pair was also assigned a non-pregnant male, size matched with the pregnant male but not paired with a female. On the second day of the male’s pregnancy, all three fish were photographed, measured, and randomly assigned to treatments of either experimental tanks of 5ng/L EE2 concentrations or the EE2-free control tanks on the second day of pregnancy. The three fish were held in 7L tanks with glass dividers between the fish that allowed for water exchange but otherwise kept the fish isolated from one another. After seven days of exposure, that is, on the ninth day of the male’s pregnancy, fish were sacrificed using MS-222 and the liver was dissected. Dissections were done with the fish soaked in RNAlater under a microscope with tissue immediately frozen on dry ice and stored in the -80°C freezer. The control and 5ng/L EE2 treatments were replicated 5 times resulting in a total of 30 fish, including 5 females, 5 pregnant males, and 5 non-pregnant males from each treatment (i.e., EE2 and control).RNA was isolated from the dissected livers using a TRIzol® Reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) extraction method modified from [53]. Total RNA was sent to the Michigan State University RTSF Genomics Core where libraries were prepared using the TruSeq mRNA Library Prep Kit v2. Libraries were tested for quality control using Caliper GX and qPCR methods. All 30 individuals were barcoded, allowing for each individual’s sequence data to be recovered. The 30 libraries were sequenced using two lanes of an Illumina HiSeq 2500 Rapid Run flow cell v1. Base calling was done by Illumina Real Time Analysis (RTA) v1.17.21.3 and output of RTA was demultiplexed and converted to FastQ with Illumina Bcl2fastq v1.8.4.A total of 805 million 150 bp paired end reads were obtained from the MSU Genomics core and were then trimmed with Trimmomatic [54] using the following settings: HEADCROP:12, LEADING:10, TRAILING:10, SLIDINGWINDOW: 4:15, MINLEN: 50. All of the paired, trimmed files were next run through the program FLASH to identify and collapse overlapping reads before starting the assembly [55]. All of these prepared reads from the 30 individuals were assembled into a single transcriptome with Trinity using version trinityrnaseq_r20140717 and the default parameters [56]. The Trinity assembly consisted of a total of 174,578 Trinity transcripts and 130,728 Trinity ‘genes’, referred to as contigs throughout the paper. The Trinity assembly had an N50 of 1866, an average contig size of 973 nucleotides, and a total of 169,973,948 assembled bases. From the Trinity assembly, the contig with the longest open reading frame (ORF) per ‘gene’ was retained in the final transcriptome. Rsem was used to map the paired, trimmed reads from all of the individuals to the retained contigs, hereafter referred to as the “liver transcriptome” [57]. The contig counts (FPKM) from Rsem were then analyzed using EBSeq to identify differentially expressed contigs across the treatments and categories within the treatments [58]. Finally, the contigs reported by EBSeq to be differentially expressed were blasted against the non-redundant protein database at NCBI. We also used Blast2Go to ascertain Gene Ontology (GO) functions [59]. To assess the completeness of our transcriptome, we used the program CEGMAv2.5, Core Eukaryotic Gene Mapping Approach, and recovered 244 complete sequences and 247 partial gene sequences from the CEGMA database containing 248 core eukaryotic genes, using a default e-value of 10 [60]. From these CEGMA results, we can conclude that our liver transcriptome has a very high level of completeness, because the majority of the conserved core eukaryotic genes are represented. This CEGMA analysis was employed only to assess the completeness of our transcriptome assembly; all other analyses used the full set of 130,728 Trinity ‘genes’.After assessing differential expression in all pairwise treatment comparisons, we identified genes that had at least a 2-fold expression difference between control females and control males. These genes were considered to be sexually dimorphic, and their expression patterns were analyzed in all groups, including EE2-exposed fish, using heat maps. Heat maps were generated in R [61] using the package gplots [62]. We also utilized a principal components analysis (PCA) using prcomp in R (R Core Team) to compare gene expression patterns across the treatments. For this analysis, we removed all contigs that had less than the mean number of reads mapped to them (3,090 reads) across the 30 fish from the two treatments.To address whether the expression patterns we found showed signs of sex-role reversal, we compared our results to those from a similar study in zebrafish [23], a species with conventional sex roles. The zebrafish study exposed males and females to water containing 5 μg/L 17β-estradiol (i.e., a 1000-fold higher concentration than we used in our study) for 48 hours and investigated transcriptome expression in the liver. We were interested in whether female pipefish have similar gene expression patterns to zebrafish females, and whether males exposed to estrogens respond similarly in species with conventional sex roles (zebrafish) and reversed sex roles (pipefish). Venn diagrams were created to compare the number of genes with female-biased expression patterns in control females and the number of up-regulated or down-regulated genes in estrogen-exposed males. To carry out the comparisons between species, gene names were generalized by removing subunit isoform types and by grouping some gene families.Although the treatments of the same sex group together, EE2 exposed pregnant males cluster closer to the female treatments than other male groups.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0139401.s001(TIFF)https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0139401.s002(XLSX)https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0139401.s003(XLSX)https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0139401.s004(XLSX)https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0139401.s005(XLSX)https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0139401.s006(XLSX)https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0139401.s007(XLSX)The authors would like to thank Caitlin Leslie for her assistance with fish care and RNA extractions, and also Dr. Alan Pepper and Angela Hawkins for their assistance with troubleshooting transcriptome analyses.Conceived and designed the experiments: ER AGJ.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of levonorgestrel (LNG) on sex differentiation in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Embryos were exposed to LNG at environmentally relevant concentrations (0, 1, 10, 33, and 100 ng/L) and allowed to develop until sexual maturity. Histological examination at 63 days post fertilization (dpf) caused complete sex reversal and 100% males were observed in the 10, 33 and 100 ng/L treatments; gross morphological and histological examination of gonads at 142 dpf further confirmed 100% males at these exposure concentrations. The results indicate androgenic activity of LNG, and masculinization during zebrafish gonadal differentiation. The mRNA expression levels of genes involved in fish sex differentiation and gonadal development were examined at 28 and 42 dpf. Down-regulation of the mRNA expression of aromatase (e.g., cyp19a1a, cyp19a1b), the forkhead transcription factor gene L2 (foxl2) and the Fushi tarazu factor-1d (nr5a1b) were observed. In contrast, transcription of the doublesex and mab-3-related transcription factor 1 (dmrt1) gene was up-regulated. Androgen receptor (ar) mRNA expression was significantly down-regulated at 28 and 42 dpf. Co-exposure to flutamide (an androgen antagonist) and LNG, led to a decrease in the sex inversion potency of LNG. Our study has demonstrated that environmentally relevant concentrations of LNG could alter sex differentiation and gonadal development in zebrafish. Our results also suggest a potentially high ecological risk of LNG to fish populations in LNG-contaminated aquatic environments.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

In a recent study, we analyzed the impacts of FSH and LH on zebrafish reproduction by disrupting FSH and LH-β genes (fshb and lhb) using transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) technology. Using the same approach, we successfully deleted FSH and LH receptor genes (fshr and lhcgr) in the present study. In contrast to the deficiency of its cognate ligand FSH, the fshr-deficient females showed a complete failure of follicle activation with all ovarian follicles arrested at the primary growth-previtellogenic transition, which is the marker for puberty onset in females. Interestingly, after blockade at the primary growth stage for varying times, all females reversed to males, and all these males were fertile. In fshr-deficient males, spermatogenesis was normal in adults, but the initiation of spermatogenesis in juveniles was retarded. In contrast to fshr, the deletion of the lhcgr gene alone caused no obvious phenotypes in both males and females; however, double mutation of fshr and lhcgr resulted in infertile males. In summary, our results in the present study showed that Fshr was indispensable to folliculogenesis and the disruption of the fshr gene resulted in a complete failure of follicle activation followed by masculinization into males. In contrast, lhcgr does not seem to be essential to zebrafish reproduction in both males and females. Neither Fshr nor Lhcgr deficiency could phenocopy the deficiency of their cognate ligands FSH and LH, which is likely due to the fact that Fshr can be activated by both FSH and LH in the zebrafish.Gonadotropins, FSH, and LH, control gonadal development and function by binding to their specific cognate receptors, FSH receptor (FSHR) and LH/choriogonadotropin receptor (LHCGR), respectively. In mammals, FSH acts on the granulosa cells in the ovary and Sertoli cells in the testis to stimulate germ cell growth and development, whereas LH acts on steroidogenic theca cells in the ovary and Leydig cells in the testis to stimulate sex steroid biosynthesis (1, 2). FSHR and LHCGR belong to the G protein-coupled receptor family (3), and the knockout of their genes in the mouse could mostly phenocopy the functional loss of their respective ligands FSH and LH. Both FSH- and FSHR-null mutants in female mice display a blockade of folliculogenesis at preantral follicle stage, leading to infertility; however, male mutants of both genes were surprisingly fertile, albeit with significantly reduced testis size and fecundity (4–6). In LH- and LHCGR-deficient mice, the females demonstrate postnatal defects in gonadal growth with the folliculogenesis being arrested at early antral stage, also resulting in infertility. However, in contrast to FSH and FSHR mutants, the males of LH- and LHCGR-deficient mice are also infertile due to the arrest of spermatogenesis at round spermatid stage (7, 8).In teleosts, it was believed earlier that only one receptor was responsible for gonadotrophic signaling in fish (9–12). The concept of two gonadotropin receptors was proposed later in salmonids (13–15). This was further confirmed by molecular cloning in the amago salmon (16, 17). Up to now, FSHR (Fshr/fshr) and LHCGR (Lhcgr/lhcgr) have been identified and characterized in large number of species (16–22) (nearly 40 species according to GenBank records in 2014), including the zebrafish (23). Interestingly, unlike their mammalian counterparts with a well-defined receptor specificity, fish gonadotropins often show promiscuous hormone-receptor interactions. In the coho salmon, Fshr does not discriminate FSH and LH binding, whereas Lhcgr binds LH only (14). Similarly, in the African catfish and zebrafish, the cloned Fshr responds to both recombinant FSH and LH with a preference for FSH; however, Lhcgr is specifically activated by LH only (21, 24). In some other fish species, the ligand selectivity of the cloned gonadotropin receptors appears different. For example, the Lhcgr of the amago salmon responds to LH but also slightly to FSH; in contrast, the Fshr is activated by FSH only (16, 17). The physiological relevance of the promiscuous hormone-receptor selectivity in fish remains mysterious.Most studies on Fshr and Lhcgr in fish have focused on their expression profiles during the reproductive cycle (25–28). In the zebrafish, both fshr and lhcgr are exclusively expressed in the somatic follicle cells in the ovary (29). During folliculogenesis, the expression of fshr and lhcgr is very low in the primary growth (PG; stage I) follicles; however, the level of fshr mRNA increases significantly when the follicles are activated to enter the previtellogenic stage (PV; stage II) and peaks at the midvitellogenic (MV) stage. In contrast, the expression of lhcgr starts to increase after the MV stage and reaches the highest level at the full-grown (FG) stage before final oocyte maturation (23, 30). These observations support the traditional views that FSH and its receptor Fshr are involved in follicle activation to enter vitellogenic growth, whereas LH and its receptor Lhcgr play an important role at oocyte maturation and ovulation (31, 32).In male fish, it was believed that FSH might act on Fshr-expressing Sertoli cells to drive testis growth and spermatogenesis, whereas LH supported steroidogenesis and gonadal maturation through its receptor Lhcgr on the Leydig cells, similar to those in mammals (14, 33). However, this view has recently been revised. New evidence in the zebrafish and other species showed that Fshr was also expressed in the Leydig cells, and the Sertoli cells also expressed Lhcgr (34–36). The expression of Fshr and Lhcgr in both Leydig and Setoli cells in the zebrafish may be related to the undifferentiated gonochorism of gonadal sex differentiation (35). A recent study in the flatfish showed that Lhcgr was also expressed in the germ cells, and LH could induce spermiogenesis through a cAMP/protein kinase A signaling pathway (37).Despite these studies, our understanding of Fshr and Lhcgr in fish remains limited as compared with that in mammals. Due to the less selective ligand recognition and unique expression patterns in fish, the physiological roles of Fshr and Lhcgr in gonadal development and function are expected to be more complicated, which is an intriguing issue to explore. In mammalian models, the most conclusive evidence for functional roles of FSHR and LHCGR has been provided by studies using a loss-of-function approach (knockout) in the mouse (5–7, 38, 39) and natural mutants in humans (40–42). Unfortunately, the reverse genetics approach using gene knockout had not been available in fish species, making it difficult to perform comparative genetic studies on gonadotropins and their receptors. This situation has changed recently with the development of new genome editing tools, transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) (43–47).Using TALEN, we have recently disrupted the genes of gonadotropins (fshb and lhb) in the zebrafish. The lack of FSH led to a significant delay in both folliculogenesis and spermatogenesis; however, LH could rescue the lost function of FSH, probably through its promiscuous activation of Fshr. The loss of LH, on the other hand, had no effect on gonadal growth, but the female mutant fish were infertile because of failed oocyte maturation and ovulation (48). This study has led us to hypothesize that through activating Fshr, LH may provide a compensatory support to FSH in initiating puberty onset and promoting gonadal growth; however, LH plays a critical role in controlling final oocyte maturation and ovulation via either Fshr or Lhcgr, and FSH cannot compensate for this function.As a follow-up study to our report on fshb (FSH) and lhb (LH) disruption (48), we undertook this project to disrupt both FSH and LH receptor genes (fshr and lhcgr) in the zebrafish using TALEN. Considering that fish gonadotropins often have promiscuous receptor binding (24), we believe that parallel studies on both the ligands (FSH and LH) and receptors (Fshr and Lhcgr) would provide insight into the roles and importance of the promiscuous ligand-receptor recognition in vivo. Unlike many genes in the zebrafish that have duplicated paralogues, there is only one copy of fshr and lhcgr genes in the zebrafish genome, which reduces the complication of the genetic approach. The most striking discoveries from the present study are that the loss of Fshr and Lhcgr did not phenocopy the knockouts of their cognate ligands (fshb and lhb) alone, but the double knockouts of ligands and receptors showed similar phenotypes, albeit not to the same extent.The zebrafish fshr and lhcgr mutants were generated by TALEN-induced gene knockout as described in our recent report (48). Briefly, the TALEN sites were designed by using the TAL Effector Targeter (https://tale-nt.cac.cornell.edu), and the TALEN constructs were assembled as reported (49). The 5′-capped mRNAs (50 pg each) generated by in vitro transcription with the mMESSAGE and mMACHINE SP6 kit (Invitrogen) were microinjected into the one- or two-cell stage embryos using the Drummond Nanoject injector (Drummond Scientific).The F0 founders carrying mosaic mutations were identified by high-resolution melt analysis (HRMA) (48, 50) and mated with wild-type fish to generate heterozygous F1 offspring. The heterozygous F1 fish were genotyped by fin clip assay, and the individuals with frameshift or nonsense sequence alterations were selected. Male and female siblings of the F1 generation carrying the same mutation were mated to generate the homozygous F2 mutant.For genotyping, the genomic DNA was obtained from a single embryo or caudal fin tissue by the sodium hydroxide (NaOH) method (48, 51) for HRMA and/or HMA (48, 52). HRMA was efficient to detect TALEN-induced mutations (48, 50). Briefly, primers flanking the target site were used to amplify the genomic region on the Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time system and the HRMA analysis was carried out using the Precision Melt Analysis software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). In addition to HRMA, HMA was also used in this study for genotyping, especially for the heterozygous F1. When HRMA data were ambiguous, HMA was useful in providing more definitive genotyping information despite its relatively lower throughput. The same primers for HRMA were used to generate genomic fragment containing the target site, and 5 μL of the PCR was electrophoresed on 20% polyacrylamide gels for HMA.All fish sampled were recorded for their body weight, standard body length, and age before processing for histological examination (48). Sibling wild-type (+/+) and/or heterozygous (+/−) fish were used as control for phenotype analysis. Briefly, the fish was anesthetized with MS-222 (tricaine methanesulphonate, 250 mg/L; Sigma-Aldrich) and placed on a petri dish cover to measure body length followed by body weight determination on an analytical balance. After the measurements, the fish were photographed before dissection for histological processing and examination. For whole-body histology, the fish were decapitated and fixed immediately in Bouin's solution for at least 24 hours followed by washing and storing in 70% ethanol. The fixed samples were then dehydrated and embedded in paraffin for sectioning. The sections (7 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and mounted with Canada balsam (Sigma) for microscopic examination.To illustrate the effect of Fshr on PG follicle growth, we measured the diameters of follicles at 40 days after fertilization (dpf) in the ovary of fshr-deficient fish and the control. Briefly, the longitudinal ovarian section of the largest size in each fish was photographed on the Nikon ECLIPSE Ni microscope followed by diameter measurement of every follicle in the section by SPOT Advanced imaging software (Diagnostic Instruments). Only the follicles with a visible nucleus were included in the analysis.The primary follicle cell culture was performed according to our previous report (53). Briefly, zebrafish were anesthetized by ice shock and decapitated before dissection. The ovaries were isolated and dispersed into free ovarian follicles for culture in M199 (Gibco-BRL) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) at 28°C in 5% CO2. After 6 days of incubation, the cultured follicle cells were subcultured in 24-well plates. After 24 hours of incubation for attachment, the cells were washed with serum-free M199 twice before treatment. The cells were treated with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; 15 IU/mL) in serum-free M199 medium for 2 hours followed by RNA extraction for real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis.Total RNA was extracted from the ovary, testis, or cultured follicle cells using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, Ohio) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For ovaries from juvenile fish (40 dpf), the fish were first placed in RNAlater (QIAGEN) and stored at −20°C to harden tissues for easy dissection of the small gonads. All total RNA was converted into cDNA by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Conventional semiquantitative RT-PCR was used to confirm the mutations in mRNA. Real-time qPCR was carried out on the CFX96 real-time system (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using primers listed in Supplemental Table 1. A standard curve was constructed in each real-time qPCR assay using cloned DNA fragment as the template for absolute quantification.For statistical analysis, the expression levels of target genes in cultured follicle cells or ovaries were normalized to that of the internal control ef1a and expressed as fold change relative to the control. All values were expressed as the mean ± SEM, and the data were analyzed by a Student's t test using Prism 6 on Macintosh OS X (GraphPad Software).To ensure complete disruption of functional proteins, we chose the TALEN target sites near the translation start codon (Supplemental Figure 1). The TALE proteins turned out to be extremely efficient to induce somatic mutation in both fshr and lhcgr. All the embryos sampled after injection of TALEN mRNAs carried mutations at 24 hours after fertilization for both fshr (10 of 10) and lhcgr (10 of 10) (Supplemental Figure 2). The remaining F0 embryos were raised to adulthood and genotyped by HRMA on genomic DNA isolated from the fin cuts. The mutation rates were 50% (5 of 10) for fshr and 60% (6 of 10) for lhcgr in the adult F0 fish. The healthy F0 founders carrying somatic mutations were crossed with wild-type fish to obtain F1 offspring. High rates of germline transmission were demonstrated by HRMA in the F1 offspring for both genes (55% for fshr and 85% for lhcgr) (Supplemental Figure 3).Although the F0 founder fish are genetically mosaic in both somatic and germ cells, the germline mosaic level was not as high as that in the somatic cells, as suggested in a recent study (50). As shown in Supplemental Figure 3, one fshr mutant F0 fish produced two mutations in F1 offspring (Supplemental Figure 3A), and three were produced by one lhcgr F0 fish (Supplemental Figure 3B). The low mosaic level and high germline transmission rate make it possible to obtain both male and female sibling fish that carry the same mutation to produce homozygous F2 mutants (Supplemental Figure 3). For fshr, an 11-bp deletion (Δ11) leading to frame shifting of the coding sequence was chosen to establish the mutant line for phenotype analysis, and a 14-bp deletion for lhcgr (Δ14) was selected (Supplemental Figure 3).Homozygous fshr and lhcgr mutant individuals (fshr−/− and lhcgr−/−) were then obtained in F2 offspring, and their genotypes were confirmed by both HRMA (Supplemental Figure 4) and HMA (Supplemental Figure 3). To confirm the mutation at mRNA level, we performed an RT-PCR analysis for the fshr and lhcgr mRNAs by using a deletion-specific primer (P3), and the result showed no detection of mRNAs in mutant gonads (Supplemental Figure 4).Examined at 90 dpf (3 mo) when the zebrafish is expected to be sexually mature and spawning, no homozygous fshr mutant fish (fshr−/−) showed obvious morphological signs of sexual dimorphism, whereas the genders of the sibling control fish (fshr+/+ and fshr+/−) could be easily identified with females showing an enlarged abdomen. Dissection and histological analysis showed a full range of follicles from the PG to FG stage in the ovary of the control fish whereas mutant females (fshr−/−) had extremely small ovaries, with all follicles being arrested at PG stage with signs of degeneration (shrinking oocytes with condensed basophilic cytoplasm and increased interfollicular space) (54). No PV or stage II follicles could be observed in the mutant ovary, suggesting a complete blockade of folliculogenesis at the PG-PV transition (Figure 1A).A, Anatomical and histological examination of the ovary in controls (fshr+/+ and fshr+/−) and fshr-deficient fish (fshr−/−). B, Anatomical and histological examination of the testis in controls and fshr-deficient fish. The arrow in the dissected fish shows the testis. LV, late vitellogenic; sc, spermatocytes; sg, spermatogonia; sz, spermatozoa.We then examined fish sampled at earlier times covering puberty onset (40 and 45 dpf) and maturation (65 dpf) to find out when the mutant (fshr−/−) and control fish (fshr+/−) started to differ in their ovarian growth and folliculogenesis. The control and mutant fish examined had similar body size (data not shown). As shown in Figure 2A, the control fish showed normal ovarian development, with large PG follicles at 40 dpf and PV follicles at 45 dpf, a marker for puberty (55, 56). In contrast, the ovaries of mutant fish were extremely small, with only one or two layers of underdeveloped PG follicles in the section. The PG follicles in the mutant ovaries were also small, with increased basophilia and condensation of ooplasm, a sign of degeneration. This situation remained the same at 65 dpf except that the interfollicular space increased further (Figure 2A).A, Ovarian growth and follicle development in control (fshr+/−) and fshr-deficient mutant females (fshr−/−). B, Testis development in control (fshr+/−) and mutant males (fshr−/−). The asterisk indicates the activated PV follicle, and the arrow shows the ovary or testis in each longitudinal section, which is also circled by a dotted line to distinguish from the surrounding organs. The degenerating or apoptotic oocyte-like germ cells in the testis are indicated by the arrowhead. sc, spermatocytes; sg, spermatogonia; sz, spermatozoa.To investigate whether fshr deficiency affects early spermatogenesis, we examined juvenile or young males at 40, 45, and 65 dpf. The control fish (fshr+/−) showed normal progress of spermatogenesis with spermatocytes at all sampling times and mature spermatozoa present at 45 and 65 dpf. In contrast, the testes in mutant males showed significant retardation in growth with delayed spermatogenesis, and all germ cells were arrested at spermatogonial stage with apoptotic oocyte-like germ cells (Figure 2B).Despite a delayed initiation of spermatogenesis, the testis of most mutant males showed normal development as compared with the controls at 90 dpf when the zebrafish is supposed to be sexually mature (Figure 1B). When tested for fertility at 90 dpf, all control males (fshr+/−) could induce female spawning with normal fertilization. Interestingly, most fshr-deficient males (fshr−/−) were also fertile (7 of 10); however, some individuals failed to induce wild-type females to spawn (three trials for each individual with a 2 d interval). Further histological analysis showed that the mutant males that could spawn successfully had normal spermatogenesis in the testis (Figure 3A, left panel). However, the mutant males that failed to spawn showed retarded spermatogenesis in the testis, which contained fewer spermatocytes and more abundant spermatogonia (Figure 3A, right panel). These individuals might have developed from females through sex reversal (see below), resulting in delayed spermatogenesis as compared with that of controls as well as genotypic male mutants of the same age.A, Testis development in mutant fish (fshr−/−) at 90 dpf. Some individuals had underdeveloped testis (right panel), which might have developed from females through sex reversal. The arrow in the dissected fish shows the gonads. B, Normal testis development in fshr-deficient fish sampled at 120–122 dpf (left panel, 32 in total). Only one female was found at 122 dpf (right panel) in this group with all follicles arrested at the PG stage. C, Fertility assay for fshr and lhcgr mutants at 90 dpf. The fertility of homozygous mutant fish was assessed by natural breeding in a breeding box (Techniplast). Male fshr mutant was crossed with wild-type female because mutant adult females were rare and infertile. D, Evidence for sex reversal in fshr-deficient adult zebrafish. Two fish at 100 and 105 dpf were identified with ovotestis. The arrow shows meiotic spermatogenic cells among degenerating PG follicles in the ovary (left panel, circled) at 100 dpf and degenerating follicles among spermatogenic tissue at 105 dpf (right panel). E, Temporal change of female ratio from 25 to 210 dpf. The number in each column is the sample size. sc, spermatocytes; sg, spermatogonia; sz, spermatozoa.Although fshr-deficient fish showed normal sex differentiation, further gonadal development showed significant abnormalities as described above. The folliculogenesis in females was arrested at the early PG stage without transition into the PV stage, and the spermatogenesis in males was delayed at an early stage. Interestingly, most fshr−/− individuals examined in one experiment at 120–122 dpf (32 in total) were surprisingly males with normal spermatogenesis (Figure 3B, left panel), and only one female was found at 122 dpf with folliculogenesis in the ovary completely halted at the PG stage (Figure 3B). The identification of female individuals became increasingly difficult in older fish, and the last two females were discovered at 210 dpf with all follicles still arrested at the PG stage (data not shown). Different from the mutant males examined at 90 dpf, which included both fertile and infertile individuals, all male individuals examined at 120 dpf (20 in total) could induce female spawning with successful fertilization (Figure 3C). This observation led us to hypothesize that without Fshr, the females observed in juvenile or young fish must have undergone a process of sex reversal to become males. To provide evidence for this hypothesis, we screened fish aged between 100 and 120 dpf by histology with the aim to identify individuals with transitional gonads or ovotestis. All fish examined during this period were males except two individuals identified at 100 and 105 dpf, respectively (Figure 3D). The gonads of the 100-dpf fish were still predominantly ovaries with underdeveloped PG follicles that were well separated with large interfollicular space and enhanced ooplasmic basophilia; however, signs of spermatogenesis could be seen between follicles (Figure 3D, left panel). The 105-dpf fish had a well-developed testis with degenerating oocytes scattered among spermatogenic cells (Figure 3D, right panel).To provide clues to when sex reversal occurred during gonadal development, we analyzed the temporal change of female ratio at different stages. The samples (499 in total) were divided into four age groups representing gonadal differentiation and puberty (25–50 dpf), sexual maturation (51–75 dpf), early spawning (75–100 dpf), and late spawning (101–210 dpf), respectively. Interestingly, there was no sex ratio difference between the control (fshr+/−; 34% female) and mutant fish (fshr−/−; 35% female) during sex differentiation and puberty (25–50 dpf), but the female ratio in the mutant started to drop during sexual maturation (51–75 dpf; 11%) and continued to decrease afterward to less than 5% after 100 dpf (Figure 3E). To provide clues to the molecular mechanism underlying the sex reversal, we determined the expression levels of some genes that are likely involved in gonadal differentiation, including sox9a, dmrt1, amh, cyp11c1, cyp19a1a, foxl2, gdf9, and inha. The ovarian samples were collected at 40 dpf when both the control and mutant ovaries contained PG follicles only and before sex reversal started. Interestingly, all four testis-promoting genes (sox9a, dmrt1, amh, and cyp11c1) significantly increased their expression in the mutant ovaries (fshr−/−) compared with that in the control (fshr+/−); in contrast, the expression of oocyte-specific gene gdf9 decreased significantly in the mutant together with inha. Surprisingly, neither aromatase (cyp191a1) nor its upstream stimulatory transcription factor foxl2 showed any significant change (Figure 4).Total RNA was extracted from the ovary after pretreatment of the fish with RNAlater (QIAGEN) followed by reverse transcription and real-time qPCR analysis. The data are mean ± SEM (n = 10). *, P < .05, **, P < .01, ***, P < .001 vs control. amh, anti-Müllerian hormone; cyp11c1, cytochrome P450, family 11, subfamily C, polypeptide 1; cyp19a1a, aromatase; dmrt1, doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1; foxl2, forkhead box L2; gdf9, growth differentiation factor 9; inha, inhibin-α subunit; sox9a, SRY-box 9a.After demonstrating delayed spermatogenesis in males and failed puberty onset or PG-PV transition in females, we turned our attention to potential role of Fshr in an even earlier event, ie, gonadal development at sex differentiation, although there was no difference in sex ratio at this stage as shown above (Figure 3E). To this end, we examined fish at 25, 30, 35, and 40 dpf, a critical period when gonadal differentiation occurs in the zebrafish (55, 56).We did not observe much difference in testis formation and growth between control (fshr+/−) and mutant (fshr−/−) male fish from 25 to 35 dpf, although the mutant testes seemed to be smaller. Both the control and mutant testes contained primarily spermatogonia during this period. The difference became significant at 40 dpf when the control testes started to grow quickly with active spermatogenesis; in contrast, the mutant testes still remained underdeveloped without any spermatocytes (Figure 5A). In contrast to males, the ovarian formation and growth in females exhibited significant difference between the control and mutant fish during the same period from 25 to 40 dpf. At all four time points, the control fish had a well-formed ovary containing abundant and tightly packed perinucleolar oocytes or PG follicles, which steadily grew in size from 25 to 40 dpf. In contrast, the ovaries of mutant fish were evidently smaller than those of the control (Figure 5, A and B), and they contained much less and smaller follicles, which did not grow much over the period (Figure 5A).A, Juvenile control (fshr+/−) and mutant (fshr−/−) zebrafish of similar body size were sampled for histological analysis during the period (25–40 dpf) when gonadal differentiation occurs. The lack of Fshr did not seem to affect gonadal differentiation but reduced the size and number of the germ cells, especially in females. The arrow shows the gonads, which are outlined by dotted lines to distinguish from the surrounding tissues, and arrowhead shows degenerating oocyte-like germ cells. B, Ovaries from control (fshr+/−) and mutant (fshr−/−) fish. C, Size distribution of PG follicles in the ovary of control and mutant fish at 40 dpf.The small follicles in the mutant ovaries suggested that there was a significant blockade of folliculogenesis at early PG stage. To provide quantitative data on the blockage, we measured sizes of follicles in the ovaries of control and mutant fish at 40 dpf (n = 4). Interestingly, the follicles from the control ovaries had a wide range of size distribution up to 100 μm in diameter; in contrast, the mutant ovaries only contained follicles of less than 40 μm, with the majority being in the range of 21–30 μm (Figure 5C).In contrast to the significant phenotypes of fshr deficiency in both females and males, knockout of lhcgr surprisingly produced no observable phenotypes in both sexes. Gross anatomical examination at 90 dpf showed normal growth of both the ovary and testis in mutant fish (lhcgr−/−) compared with controls (lhcgr+/+ and lhcgr+/−). Histological analysis demonstrated normal folliculogenesis in the ovary (Figure 6A) and spermatogenesis in the testis (Figure 6B) of all three genotypes. A fertility test showed that both female and male lhcgr-deficient zebrafish were fully fertile (Figure 3C).Adult zebrafish with similar body size were sampled at 90 dpf for morphological and histological analysis.

CTL, control.The lack of observable phenotypes in the lhcgr mutant was surprising. To provide further evidence for the successful disruption of the lhcgr gene, we performed a functional study by examining the responsiveness of a LH-responsive gene, activin βA2 (inhbab), to hCG (LH analog) in cultured follicle cells (53). When treated with hCG, which specifically activates Lhcgr but not Fshr in the zebrafish (23, 24), the expression of inhbab increased significantly in cultured follicle cells from both lhcgr+/+ and lhcgr+/− ovaries. However, there was no response at all in the cells from mutant fish (lhcgr−/−), indicating a complete loss of the functional LH receptor (Figure 6C).To demonstrate whether there is any decline of gametogenesis in lhcgr-mutant fish at late spawning stage, we performed a histological analysis of both testis and ovary at 195 dpf. The result showed no difference in both spermatogenesis and folliculogenesis (Figure 7, A and B). To provide clues to the underlying mechanism for normal gametogenesis in the lhcgr mutant, we analyzed the expression of inhbab and fshr in the follicles of different stages (PV, MV, and FG) from both the control and mutant fish. Interestingly, although inhbab is highly responsive to LH in vitro (Figure 6C), its expression in the mutant ovary only decreased slightly but not significantly at FG stage when the expression of lhcgr reaches the highest level (23, 30). In contrast, the expression of fshr increased significantly in the FG follicles from the mutant ovary (Figure 7C).A, Spermatogenesis in control (lhcgr+/−) and mutant (lhcgr−/−) males. sc, spermatocytes; sg, spermatogonia; sz, spermatozoa.

The fish were sampled at 45 dpf when puberty onset is expected. In contrast to the deficiency of Fshr, the lack of Lhcgr had no effect on the timing of follicle activation or puberty onset in females because PV follicles appeared in the ovaries of both control and mutant fish. There was no obvious difference in spermatogenesis as well between the mutant and control at 45 dpf (Figure 8).Juvenile zebrafish were sampled for histological analysis at 45 dpf when puberty onset is expected in females. The marker used for puberty onset is the appearance of PV follicles (asterisk) that contain cortical alveoli. The arrow shows the gonads, which are also outlined by dotted lines.With fshr and lhcgr mutants available, we also created zebrafish carrying double mutations of the two receptors. With no observable phenotypes in lhcgr-deficient fish, we expected that double mutation of the two genes would phenocopy fshr mutation to produce all-male and fertile individuals. Surprisingly, simultaneous disruption of the two receptors led to complete infertility, at least up to 190 dpf. Anatomical and histological analyses revealed that compared with the single mutation control (fshr−/−/lhcgr+/−), the gonads of double mutants (fshr−/−/lhcgr−/−) were extremely small, with no growth from 82 to 190 dpf. Unlike the single fshr mutation, we did not observe any signs of oocyte formation in the gonads of double mutants. Most gonads were at an undifferentiated state, even at 190 dpf, whereas some individuals showed early signs of spermatogenesis, eg, the fish at 82 and 150 dpf (Figure 9).The control fish (fshr−/−/lhcgr+/−) showed normal testis development at 82 dpf, whereas the double mutants (fshr−/−/lhcgr−/−) were infertile with extremely underdeveloped testes up to 190 dpf. The testis showed no growth during the sampling period, leading to complete infertility. sc, spermatocytes; sg, spermatogonia; sz, spermatozoa.Using TALEN technology, we have recently deleted the genes coding for FSH- and LH-β subunits (fshb and lhb) in the zebrafish, creating two mutants that lack FSH or LH hormone, respectively. Despite a significant delay of puberty onset in both females and males, the ovary and testis in fshb-deficient zebrafish could still develop to full size, and the fish were fertile in both sexes (48). We hypothesized that the catch-up gonadal growth and fertility in the fshb-deficient zebrafish were likely due to the possibility that LH might play a compensatory role for FSH by activating FSH receptor (Fshr/fshr) (23, 24). This hypothesis is now supported by the evidence from the present study that the loss of Fshr led to a complete failure of follicle activation or PG-PV transition in the ovary. The activation of Fshr by both FSH and LH in the zebrafish would explain why the deletion of fshr could not phenocopy that of fshb (48). FSH is the primary ligand of Fshr; however, when FSH is absent, LH may play a compensatory role by activating Fshr to drive folliculogenesis and spermatogenesis in both females and males.In addition to the blockade of folliculogenesis at the PG-PV transition, the ovaries of fshr-deficient fish were extremely small, with much fewer and smaller PG follicles, which could grow to only 40 μm in diameter at 40 dpf compared with 100 μm in the control. This observation strongly suggests that the PG period before follicle activation (PV stage) is not gonadotropin independent, as is usually believed (57), and that the Fshr signaling, triggered by either FSH or LH or both, plays an important role in controlling both the number and growth of PG follicles, especially the late PG stage. In Fshr-deficient mouse, the ovaries were also significantly reduced in size with the follicular development being arrested at preantral stage (presumably equivalent to the PG stage in the zebrafish), and the animals cannot initiate puberty for sexual maturation (5, 58). These phenotypes are fully consistent with our observations in the fshr-deficient zebrafish. The conserved phenotypes of Fshr/FSHR deficiency in both zebrafish and mammals suggest a conserved role for FSH-FSHR signaling in controlling folliculogenesis across vertebrates.Very interestingly, although the ovarian growth and follicle activation were completely halted in the absence of Fshr, the follicles did not remain arrested indefinitely. After being blocked at PG stage for some time without Fshr, all female zebrafish eventually turned into males probably by sex reversal, leading to nearly all-male adults after 100 dpf (Figure 10). In support of sex reversal was the evidence that there was no difference in sex ratio between fshr-deficient fish and the control from 25 to 50 dpf when gonadal differentiation and puberty occur in the zebrafish and the female ratio decreased significantly during sexual maturation (51–75 dpf). In addition, individuals with ovotestis were observed as late as 105 dpf, which is far beyond the time of sexual differentiation (∼30 dpf) (55, 56). Our observation is surprisingly similar to a recent report in the medaka that a mutation in fshr gene induced by TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes) led to the masculinization of females (59). We also observed similar phenomenon of sex reversal in fshb-deficient fish in our recent study; however, the rate of sex change was not as high as that in fshr-deficient fish. This difference could most likely be due to the cross-activation of Fshr by LH in the absence of FSH because the double knockout of fshb and lhb led to all-male offspring (48). The change from female to male or masculinization without Fshr in both the zebrafish and medaka supports the concept that sex differentiation in fish has greater plasticity as compared with that in mammals.Although Fshr does not seem to play a role in gonadal differentiation, it is essential for ovarian growth and folliculogenesis afterward. In the absence of Fshr, both the size and number of the PG follicles in the ovary before puberty are reduced, suggesting a role for Fshr signaling during primary growth stage. Fshr is also indispensable for the activation of PG follicles to enter the fast secondary or vitellogenic growth. After being arrested for some time without Fshr, all female zebrafish eventually turn into males through sex reversal, leading to all-male adults. The spermatogenesis in genetic or sex-reversed males in the absence of Fshr is driven by Lhcgr. Double mutation of fshr and lhcgr results in male infertility. EV, early vitellogenic.In addition to genetic factors, both external environmental and internal endocrine conditions may affect sex differentiation in fish. One possible endocrine mechanism for sex reversal after 50 dpf was a lower expression of aromatase because the systemic estrogens have been shown to be important in maintaining female status in the zebrafish (60, 61). A recent study showed that when treated with an aromatase inhibitor, the mature female zebrafish changed sex to male (60). However, our gene expression data did not seem to support this hypothesis. The expression of aromatase (cyp19a1a) and its upstream transcription factor foxl2 (62) in the ovary at 40 dpf showed no difference between fshr mutant and the control. In contrast, all four testis-promoting genes (sox9a, dmrt1, amh, and cyp11c1) (63–65) significantly increased expression in the fshr-deficient ovary, whereas the expression of gdf9, an oocyte-specific growth factor (66), decreased. This result suggests that an enhanced testis-promoting activity is likely a major driving force for the sex reversal in the fshr mutant. The potential compensatory role of Fshr for Lhcgr is further supported by our observation that the expression of fshr was significantly up-regulated in the Lhcgr-deficient follicles, especially at the FG stage, whereas the LH-responsive inhbab expression was maintained.The lack of Fshr did not seem to affect testis development in adults, and all males tested were fertile after 120 dpf. However, examination at earlier stages in juveniles showed that similar to the situation in females, fshr-deficient males also demonstrated delayed spermatogenesis. Our observation suggests that Fshr signaling by either FSH or LH plays an important but not determining role in triggering the initiation of spermatogenesis at puberty onset, but its importance declined afterward. This result is consistent with the report in mammals that Fshr-deficient male mice showed delayed puberty (6). In some fshr-deficient fish, we observed delayed spermatogenesis as late as 90 dpf. These individuals were likely those converted from females. Despite the delay, all males including those converted from genotypic females were fertile as shown by the fertility test.One of the most striking discoveries of the present study was the lack of obvious phenotypes of Lhcgr deficiency in adult males and females, which were both fertile. This agrees with a similar study published recently (67). Our further experiments on early stages of development revealed no difference between lhcgr mutant and the control in terms of follicle activation or puberty onset. In contrast, the knockout of LHCGR in the mouse caused infertility in both males and females with severe abnormalities, including reduced plasma sex steroid levels (estradiol in females and testosterone in males) and reduced gonadal sizes (7). In humans, an inactivating mutation of LHCGR resulted in female infertility with failed ovulation; however, the ovary had normal structure with all stages of follicles present, suggesting normal FSH-FSHR signaling (68). A nonsense mutation of LHCGR in a boy also led to infertility with Leydig cell hypoplasia (69). Different from FSH and its receptor Fshr, which could not fully phenocopy each other when deleted due to promiscuous activation of Fshr by LH, the disruption of the zebrafish lhcgr gene seemed to phenocopy that of lhb well in terms of gonadal growth. However, the phenotypes of lhcgr and lhb mutants do not agree in terms of oocyte maturation and ovulation in vivo. The lhb-deficient females were infertile due to failed oocyte maturation and ovulation, whereas lhcgr-deficient fish were normal in this regard (48).The lack of obvious phenotypes in Lhcgr-deficient male and female zebrafish poses a challenge to traditional views on the role and importance of the LH-Lhcgr signaling in fish. This signaling pathway does not seem to play any role in puberty onset, gonadal growth, and gamete maturation in both sexes. However, the well-established concept that LH plays an important role in triggering final oocyte maturation and ovulation holds true in the zebrafish because our recent study showed that lack of LH led to infertility because of failed oocyte maturation and ovulation; obviously this role could not be compensated for by FSH (48). The fact that the Lhcgr mutation did not phenocopy LH deficiency in this aspect strongly suggests that LH may most likely signal through an alternative pathway involving Fshr in the absence of Lhcgr. This illustrates a potential safeguarding role of the promiscuous activation of Fshr by LH in the zebrafish and probably other fish species with similar phenomenon as well (21, 70, 71).The lack of obvious phenotypes in lhcgr-deficient zebrafish does not fully exclude the importance of this receptor in reproduction, and its potential role was best illustrated by the double mutation of fshr and lhcgr. Although the fshr and lhcgr mutation alone caused limited or little disturbance to spermatogenesis in adult males, simultaneous mutation of both fshr and lhcgr resulted in a severe retardation of testis development. The testes in mutant fish were so underdeveloped that the fish were all infertile at the time of examination (up to 190 dpf). This suggests that when Fshr alone is absent, the delayed but normal process of spermatogenesis is indeed driven by Lhcgr signaling.In summary, using TALEN technology to induce gene mutation, the present study provides comprehensive comparative evidence, for the first time in fish, for roles of Fshr and Lhcgr in male and female reproduction. Although our results support some established views in fish models and are consistent with some findings in mammalian models (for comparison, see Supplemental Table 2) such as FSH-Fshr signaling in puberty onset and gonadal growth, some discoveries from the present study are indeed challenging the long-held views in fish reproductive biology. Our major findings are summarized as follows: 1) Fshr signaling is essential for early gonadal growth in both males and females; 2) all fshr-deficient females reverse to males after a certain period of blockade at the PG stage (Figure 10); 3) neither Fshr nor Lhcgr alone is indispensable to spermatogenesis; however, the loss of both leads to infertility due to underdeveloped testis and retarded spermatogenesis at adult stage; and 4) the traditional canonical LH-Lhcgr signaling does not seem to be essential for zebrafish fertility, and the role of LH is likely mediated by the LH-Fshr pathway.This work was substantially supported by grants from the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong (Grants CUHK464308 and 464409); grants from the Areas of Excellence Scheme of Hong Kong on Marine Environmental Research and Innovative Technology (Project Number AoE/P-04/04) and Organelle Biogenesis and Function (Grant AoE/M-05/12); and Grants from the University of Macau (SRG2013-00040-FHS, CPG2014-00014-FHS, and MYRG2014-00062-FHS) and The Macau Fund for Development of Science and Technology Grant (FDCT114/2013/A3).Disclosure Summary: The authors have nothing to disclose.For News & Views see page 3490days after fertilizationfull grownFSH receptorhuman chorionic gonadotropinheteroduplex motility assayhigh-resolution melt analysisLH/choriogonadotropin receptormidvitellogenicprimary growthprevitellogenic stagequantitative PCRtranscription activator-like effector nuclease.Google ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarOxford University Press is a department of the University of Oxford. It furthers the University's objective of excellence in research, scholarship, and education by publishing worldwideAdvanced SearchSex determination can be robustly genetic, strongly environmental, or genetic subject to environmental perturbation. The genetic basis of sex determination is unknown for zebrafish (Danio rerio), a model for development and human health. We used RAD-tag population genomics to identify sex-linked polymorphisms. After verifying this “RAD-sex” method on medaka (Oryzias latipes), we studied two domesticated zebrafish strains (AB and TU), two natural laboratory strains (WIK and EKW), and two recent isolates from nature (NA and CB). All four natural strains had a single sex-linked region at the right tip of chromosome 4, enabling sex genotyping by PCR. Genotypes for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with the strongest statistical association to sex suggested that wild zebrafish have WZ/ZZ sex chromosomes. In natural strains, “male genotypes” became males and some “female genotypes” also became males, suggesting that the environment or genetic background can cause female-to-male sex reversal. Surprisingly, TU and AB lacked detectable sex-linked loci. Phylogenomics rooted on D. nigrofasciatus verified that all strains are monophyletic. Because AB and TU branched as a monophyletic clade, we could not rule out shared loss of the wild sex locus in a common ancestor despite their independent domestication. Mitochondrial DNA sequences showed that investigated strains represent only one of the three identified zebrafish haplogroups. Results suggest that zebrafish in nature possess a WZ/ZZ sex-determination mechanism with a major determinant lying near the right telomere of chromosome 4 that was modified during domestication. Strains providing the zebrafish reference genome lack key components of the natural sex-determination system but may have evolved variant sex-determining mechanisms during two decades in laboratory culture.…researchers using standard lines of zebrafish that have long been maintained in laboratories are often plagued by severe sex ratio distortions…. C. Lawrence, J. P. Ebersole, and R. V. Kesseli (2008)CONSIDERING the fundamental importance of sex for species propagation, it is surprising that primary sex-determining mechanisms are not strongly conserved among animal taxa (Bull 1983; Charlesworth 1996; Ming et al. 2011; Bachtrog et al. 2014). Closely related species or even populations of the same species can have different sex-determining mechanisms (Takehana et al. 2007; Ross et al. 2009; Kobayashi et al. 2013; Heule et al. 2014; Larney et al. 2014). Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a popular model for studies of vertebrate development, behavior, physiology, evolution, disease, and human health (Mills et al. 2007; Seth et al. 2013; Braasch et al. 2014; Ota and Kawahara 2014; Wilkinson et al. 2014), but researchers struggle with highly variable and distorted sex ratios, and investigations into the genetic nature of zebrafish sex determination are conflicting. To help understand these issues, we conducted a population genomic study of sex determination in multiple zebrafish strains.Zebrafish exhibit a juvenile ovary phase in which the gonad contains meiotic oocytes in all individuals: in some juveniles, oocytes survive and the individual becomes a female, but in others, oocytes die from about 19 to 27 days postfertilization and the fish becomes a male (Takahashi 1977; Uchida et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2007; Rodriguez-Mari et al. 2010). In the absence of germ cells (Slanchev et al. 2005; Siegfried and Nusslein-Volhard 2008) and in mutants in which oocytes undergo apoptosis (Rodríguez-Marí et al. 2005, 2010; Rodríguez-Marí and Postlethwait 2011), gonads develop as testes and individuals become males. Remarkably, mutants that produce oocytes early and reproduce as females can transform into fertile males after oocyte depletion, showing that oocytes are necessary both for primary sex determination and for maintenance of female phenotype in adult zebrafish (Dranow et al. 2013).As expected from the hypothesis that oocyte death is a major feature of zebrafish sex determination, harsh environmental conditions tend to shift sex ratios in favor of males; such factors include gamma rays, hypoxia, high density, high temperature, altered thermocycles, and poor nutrition (Walker-Durchanek 1980; Shang et al. 2006; Lawrence et al. 2008; Abozaid et al. 2011, 2012; Liew et al. 2012; Villamizar et al. 2012). Zebrafish does not, however, have a typical environmental sex-determination (ESD) mechanism like some sauropsids for which temperature is a cue (Charnier 1966; Lang and Andrews 1994; Merchant-Larios and Diaz-Hernandez 2013; Mork et al. 2014). It is more probable that zebrafish is like medaka (Oryzias latipes) in having a genetic sex-determination mechanism that is sensitive to environmental conditions (Hattori et al. 2007; Sato et al. 2005; Selim et al. 2009; Hayashi et al. 2010).Zebrafish not only lacks classic ESD, but most stocks investigated do not have cytogenetically detectable chromosomal sex determination (Schreeb et al. 1993; Pijnacker and Ferwerda 1995; Daga et al. 1996; Gornung et al. 1997; Amores and Postlethwait 1999; Gornung et al. 2000; Sola and Gornung 2001; Traut and Winking 2001; Phillips et al. 2006). In contrast, the only investigation of zebrafish taken directly from nature in India concluded that zebrafish females are the heterogametic sex (Sharma et al. 1998). The disagreement in cytogenetic results suggests that different zebrafish strains may have different karyotypic bases for sex determination.Not only is the chromosomal nature of zebrafish sex unresolved, but its genetic sex-determination (GSD) mechanism remains elusive. Repeated matings of zebrafish pairs from AB, TU (Tuebingen), and Toh strains produce consistent sex ratios, but different pairs can give quite different sex ratios (Liew et al. 2012). This result is expected if zebrafish has a genetic basis for sex determination with polygenic control that differs among strains (Liew et al. 2012). Furthermore, recent studies of sex genetics in different zebrafish strains identified sex-associated loci, confirming a genetic component to sex determination, but different studies identified different sex-associated loci (Orban et al. 2009; Siegfried 2010; Tong et al. 2010; Bradley et al. 2011; Anderson et al. 2012; Liew et al. 2012; Howe et al. 2013; Liew and Orban 2014). A cross between a female of the NA (Nadia) natural strain by a male of the AB laboratory strain identified a single sex-linked locus on zebrafish chromosome 4 (Chr4) while the reciprocal mating (female-AB-by-male-NA) showed sex-associated loci on both Chr4 and Chr3 (Anderson et al. 2012). In contrast, analysis of a female-AB-by-male-IN (India) cross identified sex-linked loci on Chr5 and Chr16 but none on Chr3 or Chr4 (Bradley et al. 2011). An F2 map constructed from a gynogenetic doubled-haploid TU female and a gynogenetic doubled-haploid AB male (i.e., both parents had only female-derived chromosomes) identified a sex-linked region on Chr16 that does not overlap with the one observed in the AB-by-IN mating (Bradley et al. 2011; Howe et al. 2013). Together, these results have been interpreted to support a polygenic sex-determination mechanism (Liew and Orban 2014), but they also support the hypothesis that different zebrafish strains utilize different genetic mechanisms to determine sex.Mapping crosses like those cited above that mate two zebrafish strains that differ in their major genetic sex-determining mechanisms might give difficult to interpret or even spurious results due to epistatic interactions between loci. Furthermore, because environmental factors can influence zebrafish sex ratios, an individual’s phenotypic sex may not match its genotypic sex. Thus, a traditional F2 mapping cross may not identify a major sex-determining locus if one of the P0 or F1 individuals is by chance sex reversed. In addition, brother-by-sister matings to make F2 families and gynogenesis protocols lead to inbreeding, which results in strongly male-biased sex ratios (Brown et al. 2012a).To help resolve the confusing state of zebrafish sex genetics, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) based on a population genomic analysis of RAD-tags (Baird et al. 2008) to identify SNPs found differentially in males or females (the “RAD-sex” method). This approach analyzes genotypes without regard to parentage and can identify loci of major effect (Atwell et al. 2010). To identify sex-specific SNPs in RAD-tags, we utilized Stacks, a program that infers genotypes from short-read sequences (Catchen et al. 2011, 2013). We investigated six zebrafish strains, including domesticated strains made lethal free for mutagenesis (AB and TU), natural strains cultured for a few years in the laboratory without deliberate genetic manipulations [EKW (EkkWill) and WIK (Wild India Kolkata)], and strains acquired directly from the wild in India [NA and CB (Cooch Behar)].Analysis of >25,000 SNPs in each of these six strains identified alleles differentially associated with sex phenotype. In all four natural strains, results identified a single sex-associated locus at the end of the long (right) arm of Chr4 (Chr4R), a locus previously identified as sar4 (sex-associated region Chr4) (Anderson et al. 2012). Results showed that the distribution of sar4 alleles in populations and their inheritance patterns in crosses were consistent with natural zebrafish populations having a WZ/ZZ sex-determination system, as previously suggested (Tong et al. 2010), and are in accord with the reported WZ/ZZ karyotype inferred for a zebrafish population taken directly from the wild (Sharma et al. 1998). Surprisingly, our experiments failed to detect any sex-linked loci in either AB or TU, two strains domesticated for mutagenesis experiments and sequenced for the zebrafish reference genome. Domestication led either to the evolution of new methods of sex determination during recent decades of selection by zebrafish researchers or to the unveiling of preexisting minor genetic sex-determining mechanisms.Zebrafish (D. rerio) were raised in the University of Oregon Zebrafish Research Facility under standard conditions (Westerfield 2007). Strains included the following:AB (ZFIN ID: ZDB-GENO-960809-7), originating from a mating of strain A and strain B purchased at two different times from a pet shop in Albany, Oregon, in the late 1970s and screened for making large numbers of lethal-free embryos by in vitro fertilization and subsequently bottlenecked through 21 gynogenetic half-tetrad individuals produced by early pressure treatment to establish the current AB strain (Walker-Durchanek 1980; Streisinger et al. 1981; Chakrabarti et al. 1983; C. Walker, personal communication)TU (Tuebingen, ZFIN ID: ZDB-GENO-990623-3), originating from a German pet store and selected to be lethal free ca. 1990 from multiple single pair crosses (Mullins et al. 1994)NA (Nadia, ZFIN ID: ZDB-GENO-030115-2, Anderson et al. 2012), the eighth generation of animals taken from nature in Nadia, India, in 2000WIK (Wild India Kolkata, ZFIN ID: ZDB-GENO-010531-2), which “derives from a wild catch in India” (Rauch et al. 1997), presumably Kolkata, about 140 km south of Nadia, originating from a single pair matingEKW (EkkWill, ZFIN ID: ZDB-GENO-990520-2), zebrafish of unknown origin maintained for many years in large populations at EkkWill Waterlife Resources (Ruskin, FL), which has supplied fish to the pet store trade since 1962 (http://www.ekkwill.com/aboutekkwill.html) and obtained from M. Carvan (University of Wisconsin—Milwaukee) (Loucks and Carvan 2004)CB (Cooch Behar), a new strain derived from fish collected in 2012 from Cooch Behar, India, ∼500 km north of Nadia, and purchased from Eugene Research Aquatics, LLC.Cooch Behar individuals taken directly from the wild gave small clutches and showed greatly reduced sex dimorphism. Dissection of CB fish taken directly from nature revealed 28 females, 4 hermaphrodites that contained both ovary and testis tissue, 1 fish with translucent tissue at the location expected for gonads, and 8 males (20% males), suggesting disrupted sex development by stress, endocrine-disrupting substances during development, or differential survival during acquisition of these animals. Supporting Information, Figure S4 shows the location of origin of the wild fish stocks discussed here.Group crosses of adults from each strain generated populations of fish from which we arbitrarily selected individuals for RAD-sex analysis. AB fish (UO stock no. S22191) came from stocks that the University of Oregon Zebrafish Research Facility maintains for shared use involving 10 crosses, each with 2 males and 2 females. Our TU population (S23232) came from in vitro fertilization of eggs from 4 females mixed with sperm pooled from 12 males. NA fish (S23847) derived from a natural cross of an unknown number males and females. WIK fish came from two different generations, one (S23069) a natural cross of 1 female by 2 males and the other (S24746) derived from multiple natural crosses. EKW fish were maintained in three tanks of 60 unsexed fish that were bred en masse by natural matings. CB individuals were from natural matings of the first generation offspring of 28 females and 8 males captured in India. The sex of each animal was determined by microscopic observation of dissected gonads. Individuals of undetermined sex were excluded from analysis.A population of dwarf danio (D. nigrofasciatus), a close relative of zebrafish (Mayden et al. 2007; Tang et al. 2010), was raised in the University of Oregon fish facility under standard zebrafish culture conditions (Westerfield 2007). A population of medaka (O. latipes) from the Carbio strain (WLC#2674) was raised at the University of Würzburg according to standard laboratory practices (http://shigen.lab.nig.ac.jp/medaka/medakabook/index.php)(Kirchen and West 1976). Male and female medaka were selected at random from the standing aquarium population, which is maintained by natural matings of ∼50 males and 50 females each generation. The phenotypic sex of medaka was first determined from secondary sex characteristics (shape of dorsal and anal fins, spines on male anal fin rays) and confirmed by macroscopic inspection of dissected gonads. The genotypic sex of medaka was identified from the presence or absence of the dmrt1bY gene by PCR from fin clip DNA essentially as described (Nanda et al. 2003) using allele-specific primers: DMT1k (5′ CAA CTT TGT CCA AAC TCT GA 3′) and DMT1l (5′ AAC TAA TTC ATC CCC ATT CC 3′) at an annealing temperature of 56°.Genomic DNA was isolated from caudal fin clips and muscle with a Qiagen DNeasy blood and tissue kit. DNA was digested with high-fidelity SbfI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs, no. R3642S). Barcode adapters five or six nucleotides long were ligated to each sample. Restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) libraries were prepared as described (Baird et al. 2008; Amores et al. 2011; Anderson et al. 2012) and were sequenced on an Illumina HiSequation 2000 or 2500 using 100-nucleotide single-end reads. We used Stacks software (http://creskolab.uoregon.edu/stacks/) to organize reads into loci and to identify polymorphisms (Catchen et al. 2011, 2013). We RAD-sequenced 20 males and 20 females from AB, 24 males and 24 females from TU, 25 males and 25 females from NA, 21 males and 37 females from EKW, 39 males and 28 females from WIK (of which 34 males and 27 females were retained for analysis), and 49 males and 28 females from CB. Illumina sequences were quality filtered with the process_radtags program of Stacks (Catchen et al. 2011) and then aligned to the zebrafish genome (v. Zv9)(Howe et al. 2013) using GSNAP (Wu and Nacu 2010), allowing nine mismatches. Medaka sequences were aligned to the O. latipes genome (v. MEDAKA1) (Kasahara et al. 2007). Sequences that aligned to multiple sites in reference genomes were discarded. Genotypes were called from aligned reads using the refmap.pl Stacks pipeline, requiring a minimum stack depth of 10 (−m 10). Reads that did not align to the genome were analyzed with the denovo_map.pl Stacks pipeline using the following parameters: a minimum stack depth of 10 (–m 10), up to three differences when merging stacks into loci (–M 3), and up to two differences between loci when building the catalog (–n 2).Zebrafish linkage group numbers assigned based on genetic length (Postlethwait et al. 1994; Johnson et al. 1996) are given the name “chromosome” in the Zv9 version of the zebrafish reference genome; here we abbreviate “linkage group” as Chr according to zebrafish nomenclature conventions (https://wiki.zfin.org/display/general/zfin+zebrafish+nomenclature+guidelines). Cytogeneticists numbered zebrafish chromosomes based on physical length (Pijnacker and Ferwerda 1995; Daga et al. 1996; Gornung et al. 1997, 2000; Amores and Postlethwait 1999; Sola and Gornung 2001), so zebrafish genetic linkage group number and cytogenetic chromosome number are generally not the same. We assigned genetic linkage groups to physical chromosomes by fluorescent in situ hybridization (Phillips et al. 2006), which showed that, for example, cytogenetic chromosome 3 is linkage group 4, called chromosome 4 in the reference genome and Chr4 in this work.Sequences for zebrafish, medaka, and dwarf danio RAD-tags were archived under accession no. SRP044635 and mitochondrial sequences under KM196113–KM196120.Haplotypes were exported from the Stacks web interface requiring a minimum stack depth of three reads, and a blacklist of overmerged tags was generated with a custom python script (File S1). The Stacks ref_map pipeline identifies RAD-tags based on position in the genome. Overmerged tags arise when different regions of the genome have highly similar sequences, so that genomically separate RAD-tags align to the same location, resulting in a stack of RAD-tags with a biologically impossible number of alleles. We defined overmerged tags as those that had more than two alleles in more than one fish, and excluded these tags from further analysis.Polymorphic RAD-tags were exported from Stacks in genomic format using Stacks’ populations program (Catchen et al. 2013). RAD-tags were required to be present in 75% of the individuals of each sex, and blacklisted tags were excluded. For each polymorphic SNP, the program SNPstats1 (http://webpages.uidaho.edu/hohenlohe/software.html) (Hohenlohe et al. 2010) calculated a G-test statistic comparing genotypes in males and females. False discovery rate (FDR) was calculated using the Qvalue R package (Storey and Tibshirani 2003) according to the method of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995). Markers that were significantly associated with sex after the first round of analysis were then inspected by hand. An arbitrarily selected subset of five individuals was evaluated in the Stacks web interface for all loci significantly associated with sex to ensure that Stacks had called genotypes correctly. If an error was identified in any of these five individuals, then all fish in the panel were checked at that locus and corrected by hand; for example, if three or more reads of an undersequenced allele were present in a stack, the genotype was corrected to a heterozygote in the genomic output file and statistics were recalculated.Four WIK males were excluded from analysis because they had numerous genotypes throughout the genome that were not present in the vast majority of other fish from the population, suggesting migrants. One male and one female WIK were excluded because they had numerous alleles that were undersequenced and uncalled by Stacks, likely due to barcode contamination.Despite the high quality of the zebrafish reference genome (Howe et al. 2013), many scaffolds remain unassembled, especially in areas rich in repeats, such as the heterochromatic and late-replicating right arm of zebrafish cytogenetic chromosome 3 (genetic linkage group 4, Ensembl Chr4) (Pijnacker and Ferwerda 1995; Daga et al. 1996; Amores and Postlethwait 1999; Traut and Winking 2001; Phillips et al. 2006; Anderson et al. 2012; Howe et al. 2013). Some RAD-tags that were strongly associated with sex reside on scaffolds that are either unassembled or are on Chr14 in Zv9. To test for misassembly, we used a previously published data set of SbfI-based RAD-tags mapped on the zebrafish HS (heat shock) meiotic recombination mapping panel (Kelly et al. 2000; Postlethwait et al. 2000; Woods et al. 2000, 2005; Catchen et al. 2011). Filtered raw reads from RAD-tagging the HS panel were aligned to the Zv9 assembly with GSNAP, allowing five mismatches. Because these gynogenetic fish were homozygous at all loci, we relaxed Stacks parameters and required a minimum stack depth of two reads (−m 2) to call genotypes. RAD-tags that aligned to Chr4 and Chr14 in the assembled genome and to all unassembled contigs and scaffolds were used to generate meiotic linkage maps for Chr4 and Chr14.Markers were initially grouped in JoinMap 4.1 using the Independence LOD parameter under population grouping with a minimum LOD value of 8.0. Subsequent grouping was performed at a minimum LOD value of 6.0. Marker ordering was performed using the maximum-likelihood algorithm in JoinMap 4.1 with default parameters. The expected recombination count feature in JoinMap4.1 was used to identify individuals with a higher than expected number of recombination events and visual inspection of marker order was performed. When needed, marker order was optimized manually after visual inspection of the colorized graphical genotypes in JoinMap 4.1. If moving a marker or group of markers reduced the total number of recombination events, the marker was manually moved to the new position. This analysis resulted in the positioning of many unplaced contigs and scaffolds across the entire Zv9 reference genome.A pair of primers (NA_sx.F_5-CCGGCCCTCAAGGACCGAAA-3 and NA_sx.R_5-GGTTGCTCAAGTGTTGGTGAGA-3) was designed within the sequence of a RAD-tag that aligned to Chr14:37,865,815–37,865,909 and included a sex-specific indel in the NA strain (see Figure S1). GoTaq Flexi DNA polymerase (Promega, M8298) was used to amplify the product with the following PCR protocol: denaturation at 94° for 6 min, 40 cycles of 94° denaturation, 55° annealing, and 72° extension followed by a final extension step of 72° for 10 min.To infer the history of zebrafish strains, we sampled RAD-tag sequences from 10 females and 10 males arbitrarily selected from each strain and identified 9,442 RAD-tag loci that were present in all 120 samples. To root the tree, we included orthologous RAD-tags from 1 male and 1 female D. nigrofasciatus for the 4,765 RAD-tags for which orthology could be inferred across species. RAD-tag loci were considered orthologous across strains and species if they mapped to the same unique location in the zebrafish reference genome Zv9. Tags with more than one best mapping location were excluded. We aligned sequences from each RAD-tag locus using Muscle (v. 3.8.31) with default parameters. Aligned loci were concatenated into a single 887.5-kb alignment. Using this alignment, we inferred phylogenetic trees and performed bootstrap replicates with RAxML (v. 7.2.8) using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood under a GTR+I+Γ model with D. nigrofasciatus as the outgroup (Stamatakis 2014).For zebrafish strains, we assembled sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene from Illumina reads arising from small amounts of contaminating mitochondrial DNA. All reads used for RAD-tag analysis in Stacks have 6 bases left by the SbfI enzyme digestion (TGCAGG); reads without this sequence are from contaminating nuclear or mitochondrial genomic DNA. Reads with a correct barcode, but lacking a TGCAGG motif were identified with the process_radtags program from Stacks (Catchen et al. 2011) and aligned to the zebrafish genome using GSNAP (February 20, 2014, release) (Wu and Nacu 2010).To verify that a RAD-tag-based population genomics approach would identify a major sex-determination locus if one exists, we first tested a species in which the sex chromosome and major sex-determination locus has already been identified. Although Japanese medaka has a strong XY sex-determination system based on the sex-determining gene dmrt1bY located on chromosome Ola1 (O. latipes chromosome 1) (Matsuda et al. 2002; Nanda et al. 2002; Kondo et al. 2006, 2009), environmental temperature can override the system and cause genotypic females to develop as phenotypic males (Sato et al. 2005; Hattori et al. 2007; Selim et al. 2009; Hayashi et al. 2010). We analyzed 21,909 RAD-tags (Table 1) from 30 female and 31 male medaka and conducted a G-test for genotypes that are significantly associated with male or female sex at 36,115 SNPs. Although the medaka Y chromosome is fully assembled, including dmrt1bY in the middle of Ola1 (NCBI accession nos. AP006150–AP006153 (Kondo et al. 2006)), the male-specific region is not assembled well in the reference genome sequence (http://www.ensembl.org/Oryzias_latipes/Info/Index) and dmrt1bY itself is on the unassembled scaffold1535, which contains no SbfI site and hence no RAD-tags, thus excluding dmrt1bY from our analyses. Nevertheless, results revealed SNPs between 14.3 and 32.5 Mb on Ola1 that were strongly associated with sex (Figure 1A; see Table S1). Only six sex-linked RAD-tags failed to align to the reference genome, none of which were as strongly associated with sex as the best hits within the genome (Table S2). In the medaka reference genome, a region of 18.2 Mb around the position of the sex-determining locus dmrt1bY contained polymorphisms that are highly associated with sex, and 3.5 Mb of this region showed 100% correlation with the genotypic sex that had been determined previously by PCR, consistent with recombination suppression over the region showing strongly sex-specific RAD-tags. PCR genotyping and RAD-sex analysis both agreed that 2 of 31 medaka individuals with a male phenotype had a female genotype, showing that despite occasional sex reversal, the RAD-sex method is robust enough to identify sex-linked markers. Sex-linked SNPs were also identified in single RAD-tags on Ola3, Ola13, and Ola17. These SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium with the sex-linked SNPs on Ola1 (Figure 1, B and C), a result expected if these parts of Ola3, Ola13, and Ola17 were misassembled in the medaka reference genome. These experiments show that a RAD-tag-based GWAS study is an effective method for identifying a major sex-determining region despite occasional sex reversal.RAD-sex for the medaka (O. latipes) assembled genome sequence. (A) The -log10P of a G-test of genotypes associated with male or female phenotype plotted against position in the 24 medaka linkage groups, with odd-numbered linkage groups having a white background and even-numbered linkage groups having a gray background. The solid horizontal line represents a q-value of 0.01, and the dashed line represents a q-value of 0.05. The analysis identified a broad peak of sex-associated SNPs on chromosome 1, (Ola1) the medaka sex chromosome. Isolated single SNPs on chromosomes 3, 13, and 17 were also highly linked to sex. (B) Medaka females were homozygous at SNPs strongly linked to sex, as expected from an XX karyotype, on Ola1 (only two of which are shown), and Ola3, Ola13, and Ola17. (C) Most medaka males were heterozygous at SNPs strongly linked to sex, as expected from an XY sex-determination system. Phenotypic males M1 and M4 had a female genotype. SNPs on Ola3, Ola13, and Ola17 were in linkage disequilibrium with sex-linked SNPs on Ola1, a result that would occur if these regions are on Ola1 in the fish genome but have been misassembled in the medaka reference genome sequence.To identify loci linked to sex phenotype in zebrafish, we initially analyzed SbfI-associated RAD-tags (Table 1) from the widely used AB and TU strains. We tested 20 males and 20 females of the AB strain and 24 males and 24 females of the TU strain and compared results to 25 males and 25 females from NA, a natural strain from India. We analyzed 31,002 SNPs in AB and 40,391 SNPs in TU but found no markers that were significantly linked to sex (Figure 2, A and B). In contrast, analysis of 26,291 SNPs in NA fish revealed several sharp peaks of association with phenotypic sex. Sex-linked SNPs in NA were located at the right end of Chr4 between position 61.1 and 62.1 Mb, in the middle of Chr14 between 37.87 and 37.90 Mb, and on the “Not Assembled” contigs NA482 and NA683 (Figure 2C and Table S3).RAD-sex results for zebrafish strains show plots of the −log10P of a G-test of genotypes associated with male or female phenotype in zebrafish plotted against the 25 linkage groups of the assembled zebrafish genome Zv9, with odd-numbered linkage groups having a white background and even-numbered linkage groups having a gray background. Solid lines represent a q-value of 0.01, and dashed lines represent a q-value of 0.05. No SNPs were significantly associated with sex in (A) AB or (B) Tuebingen strains. In contrast SNPs significantly associated with sex were identified on Chr4 and Chr14 in (C) Nadia and (D) WIK, while only loci on Chr4 were associated with sex in (E) EkkWill and (F) Cooch Behar. In addition to the assembled genome, sex-associated SNPs appeared on unassembled contigs NA482 and NA683 for WIK and NA, NA851 for WIK and EKW, scaffold3519 for WIK, EKW, and CB, and scaffold3545 for WIK.Puzzled by the differences between AB and TU fish vs. NA fish, we analyzed two additional commonly used wild-type strains: WIK and EKW. We analyzed 39,256 polymorphic sites in 34 male and 27 female WIK fish and identified sex-associated SNPs located between 61.4 and 62.1 Mb at the end of Chr4, between 37.87 and 37.90 Mb on Chr14, and on the unassembled contigs NA482 and NA683 as found for the NA strain; in addition, sex-associated SNPs for WIK appeared on contig NA851, scaffold3519, and scaffold3545 (Figure 2D and Table S3). Analysis of 49,182 SNPs in 21 male and 37 female EKW fish again identified sex-associated SNPs on Chr4 between 61.1 and 61.2 Mb, and the unassembled fragments NA851 and scaffold3519, both of which were also identified in the WIK RAD-sex results (Figure 2E and Table S3). No locus on Chr14 was associated with sex in EKW.To verify the discrepancy between domesticated and natural stocks, we obtained zebrafish directly from a natural population in Cooch Behar in India. We bred wild-caught individuals in the lab to establish the CB strain and used some of the offspring of wild-caught individuals for RAD-sex analysis. We analyzed 94,497 polymorphic sites in 49 males and 28 females (this strain showed much higher levels of heterozygosity than any of the other stocks examined; Figure S2) and identified sex-linked SNPs on Chr4:60.6 Mb and on scaffold3519, which was also found to harbor sex-linked SNPs in WIK (Figure 2F and Table S3).DNA for the zebrafish reference genome sequence initially came from several thousand TU embryos (Howe et al. 2013), some of which would have become males and others females, despite our finding that TU had no loci strongly linked to sex phenotype. If the reference genome lacked one of the sex chromosomes, then many sex-linked RAD-tags from wild stocks would fail to align to it. Analysis, however, showed that only one sex-linked RAD-tag in NA, one in EKW, and four in WIK failed to align to the zebrafish reference genome (Table S4). SNPs in all nonaligning sex-linked RAD-tags were less strongly associated with sex than those that actually aligned to assembled or unassembled portions of the Zv9 reference genome. This result suggests that the assembly does not lack substantial amounts of any sex chromosome or that the major sex determinant is in a genomic region or unassembled contig with no SbfI sites, as is true for medaka.While all four natural populations we studied had a strong sex-associated region near the right telomere of Chr4, several strains showed sex-associated loci at other locations, including a small portion of Chr14 and a number of unassembled contigs and scaffolds (Table S5). Suspecting that the Chr14 locus and unassembled contigs and scaffolds belong on Chr4R, we utilized a previously published data set of RAD-tags generated from the zebrafish HS meiotic mapping panel (Kelly et al. 2000; Postlethwait et al. 2000; Woods et al. 2000; Woods et al. 2005; Catchen et al. 2011) to identify the position of these loci on a genetic map and hence to correct possible misassembly of these regions in Zv9. Results showed that nonassembled contigs NA683 and NA851 and scaffold3519, which are linked to sex in multiple natural populations (Table S5), all localized to the end of Chr4 near other sex-linked tags in the meiotic mapping panel (Figure 3). Sex-associated fragments NA482 and scaffold3545 lacked any RAD-tags that were polymorphic in the meiotic mapping panel and so could not be mapped. Two sex-associated RAD-tags that had aligned to Chr14 at positions Chr14:37,844,151 and Chr14:37,879,718 also mapped to Chr4R near other sex-linked RAD-tag polymorphisms. The finding that all mappable sex-linked RAD-tags in four natural strains (NA, WIK, EKW, and CB) occupy a single 1.5-Mb region at the right tip of Chr4 supports the conclusion that Chr4 represents a sex chromosome in natural populations of zebrafish. The failure to detect any sex-linked loci in AB and TU in these analyses suggests that a wild sex determinant was lost or greatly modified in the domestication of zebrafish for laboratory work and that other mechanisms have since taken the place of the natural wild genetic sex-determination system.All sex-associated RAD-tags map to Chr4. Sex-associated SNPs were mapped on the HS meiotic mapping cross panel (Kelly et al. 2000; Postlethwait et al. 2000; Woods et al. 2000; Catchen et al. 2013). The sar4 region is indicated by shading. RAD-tags that aligned to Chr14 at 37.8 Mb and to the unassembled scaffolds NA683, NA851, scaffold3519, scaffold3462, and scaffold3536 (indicated in boldface italic type) all mapped to the distal tip of Chr4R on the HS panel.To determine whether natural zebrafish utilize an XY or ZW sex-determination system, we scrutinized the SNP with the strongest statistical support for linkage to sex phenotype in each of the four natural populations. In NA, the SNP most strongly associated with sex was an A > T (nucleotide A in the reference genome vs. T in NA) polymorphism on the unassembled contig NA683 at nucleotide position 12,119 with support of −log10P = 6.8. All 15 fish with the homozygous T/T genotype were males, while 77% (23/30) of A/T heterozygotes developed as females. No individual developed as a female that did not have at least one A allele at this SNP. Only one individual was homozygous A/A, and it, rather surprisingly, developed as a male (Figure 4A). An A/A male could result from sex reversal or from recombination events that separated the sex-linked RAD-tag locus from the causative sex-determination locus. The rather small size of the zebrafish sex-associated region, about 1.5 Mb (60.6–62.1 Mb when considering all four natural strains and including all SNPs with a q-value <0.01) compared to the large region we detected in medaka (14.3–32.5 Mb, or 18.2 Mb using the same q-value) suggests that recombination suppression is stronger around the medaka sex locus than around the zebrafish sex locus.Genotypes for SNPs linked to sex phenotype with the highest statistical significance for four natural populations of zebrafish. (A) Nadia SNP at NA683:12,119 (nonassembled contig:nucleotide position), A > T, −log10P = 6.8. All T/T fish were male; 77% of A/T fish were female; the only A/A fish was male. (B) WIK SNP Chr4:62,060,103, A > C, −log10P = 5.4. All C/C fish were male; 64% of A/C and 60% of A/A fish were females. (C) EkkWill SNP at scaffold3519:177,330, A > T, −log10P = 12.5. All A/A fish were male; 94% of A/T and all T/T fish were females. (D) Cooch Behar SNP Chr4:60,623,846, C > T, −log10P = 8.5. All T/T fish were male; 52% of T/C and all seven C/C fish became female. In each of the four populations, all individuals homozygous for the “male allele” (T in NA, C in WIK, A in EKW, and T in CB) developed as males, heterozygotes (A/T in NA, C/A in WIK, T/A in EKW, and C/T in CB) developed mostly as females, and homozygotes for the “female” allele (A in NA, A in WIK, T in EKW, and C in CB) were rare and usually female. In each strain, fish with the homozygous “male allele” all became males and no individuals without the “non-male allele” (the “female allele”) developed into a female. Individuals homozygous for the “female allele” were obtained much less frequently than expected from random mating, which would be expected either if there were few matings between a male and a female both of which had at least one “female” allele or if homozygotes for the “female allele” were less likely to survive. These patterns would be expected of a WZ female/ZZ male sex-determination system with some female genotypes sex reversing to become males. (E) Analysis of the AB × NA F2 sex mapping cross (Anderson et al. 2012). RAD tag 32204, for example, which aligns to Chr4:61,934,186–61,934,280, has allele d that is present in the granddam, the F1 female, and all F2 females as expected if it resides on the W of a WZ/ZZ sex-determination system. (F) Sex-genotyping primers for NA. In the NA strain, the “female allele” in RAD-tag 4086 (which aligned to Chr14:37,865,815–37,865,909 in Zv9 but mapped to the right tip of Chr4 on the HS meiotic mapping panel, Figure 3) has a 12-nt deletion relative to the reference sequence. Primers with the sequence of the female allele in this RAD-tag gave an 85-bp fragment in females but produced an alternative amplification pattern in males. Sex-reversed individuals (as determined by this and other sex-linked RAD-tags) are indicated with an R.These data for NA show that: (1) the A allele of this SNP in NA is linked to a dominant factor that is necessary but not sufficient for development of a female phenotype; (2) the NA strain has a heterozygous female/homozygous male (e.g., ZW female/ZZ male) sex-determination system; (3) some A/T and A/A “genetic females” are sex reversed to a male phenotype due to the effects of the environment or to segregating minor genetic modifiers that our protocol could not detect; and (4) the small number of individuals with an A/A genotype could be due to the infrequent mating of a normal heterozygous A/T genotypic female to a sex-reversed heterozygous genotypic A/T male, that the homozygous A genotype is semilethal, or that these genotypes come from a recombination event between the RAD-tag and the functional sex locus.This pattern was repeated in the other natural populations. In WIK, an A > C polymorphism at Chr4:62,060,103 showed the strongest statistical support for sex linkage (−log10P = 5.4). All 16 homozygous C/C WIK fish were male, but 64% (18/28) of A/C heterozygotes and 60% (9/15) of A/A homozygotes were females (Figure 4B). In EKW, an A > T polymorphism at scaffold3519:177,330 was statistically most strongly linked to sex (−log10P = 12.5). All 18 A/A homozygotes developed as males, while 94% (32/34) of A/T heterozygotes and all four T/T homozygotes became females (Figure 4C). In CB, a C > T polymorphism at Chr4:60,623,846 was statistically most strongly linked to sex (−log10P = 8.5). All 24 homozygous T/T fish were male, while 52% (17/33) of heterozygous T/C individuals and all seven homozygous C/C fish were female (Figure 4D). While the CB result could be interpreted as supporting a balancing sex-determination system, with T/T fish developing as males, C/C fish developing as females, and heterozygotes developing as either sex, a more parsimonious explanation that mirrors other native strains is that the C allele is linked to a locus that is necessary but not sufficient for female sex development and that homozygous C/C fish come from the mating of a normal T/C female to a sex-reversed phenotypic T/C male. Taken together, data from all four wild stocks provide strong support for a female-heterogametic sex-determination system.Reanalysis of a female-NA-by-male-AB F2 mapping panel (Anderson et al. 2012) supports female heterogamety. For RAD-tag 32204 (Anderson et al. 2012), all 78 F2 individuals that inherited the grandsire’s a allele became males, but a is not a male-specifying allele because it was inherited through the F1 female. The grandsire’s b allele and the granddam’s c allele were about equally likely to be found in males and females in the F2 (52 and 58% males, respectively), so they are unrelated to sex differentiation. In contrast, 84% (74/88) of F2 fish with the granddam’s d allele, inherited through the F1 female, themselves became females and no fish without the d allele became a female (Figure 4E). These results show that a sequence linked to the d allele is necessary but not sufficient for female development in this female-NA-by-male-AB cross, independent of the other allele, consistent with a dominant, environmentally sensitive, female-determining locus at sar4 and female heterogamety.One of the RAD-tags (4086) that was tightly linked to sex in NA (−log10P = 6.0) contained a 12-bp indel with the insertion present in the female-linked allele. Although this RAD-tag aligned uniquely to Chr14:37,865,815–37,865,909 in Zv9, it mapped to the right tip of Chr4 on the HS meiotic mapping panel (Figure 3). Within the RAD-tag, we designed a forward primer containing four female-specific SNPs and a reverse primer with one female-specific SNP that amplify a single 85-bp band in NA females and a 73-bp band or a nonspecific banding pattern in NA males (Figure 4F). We tested all 50 individuals from our NA population genomic analyses, of which Stacks had genotyped 24 phenotypic females and 22 phenotypic males at this locus. PCR verified the genetic sex determined by RAD-tag analysis for all individuals, including those experiencing female-to-male sex reversal. These primers also accurately identified the sex of individuals that Stacks did not genotype at this locus (due to insufficient read depth) but were genotyped for sex at nearby SNPs.After verifying primers on the RAD-sex population, we tested other NA fish. Of eight phenotypic females tested, all had the female genotype and of eight phenotypic males tested, seven had the male genotype; the other phenotypic male had a female genotype, consistent with occasional female-to-male sex reversal observed in other natural stocks. These results show that this primer pair can identify NA fish that will definitely become males or that have a high probability of becoming females. These sex-genotyping primers will be useful for identifying genetic sex long before phenotypic sex becomes evident, which will facilitate the study of developmental mechanisms.To determine whether our four natural strains represent separate accessions from the wild and to understand their historical relationships to the two strains that lack the Chr4R sex determinant, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis using RAD-sex sequence data. We collected RAD-tag genomic data from dwarf danio (D. nigrofasciatus), one of the closest extant relatives of zebrafish, for use as outgroup (Mayden et al. 2007; Tang et al. 2010). Because D. nigrofasciatus is native to the Sittang basin in Myanmar, which is far outside the range of D. rerio (Figure S4), the two species are not sympatric (Engeszer et al. 2007; Whiteley et al. 2011). Analysis utilized 888 kb of sequence from 9442 RAD-tags present in all six D. rerio strains, including 58,282 variable positions of which 51,444 SNPs were parsimony informative.Analysis of the maximum-likelihood tree (Figure 5) and the maximum-parsimony tree (see Figure S3) provided several conclusions:Maximum-likelihood phylogeny of six D. rerio strains. The phenotypic sex of each individual is abbreviated as F (female) or M (male). Branch labels reflect bootstrap support. Each zebrafish strain represents a distinct clade.Maximum-likelihood and maximum-parsimony both gave strong support for the same phylogenetic relationships among strains. In contrast, relationships between individuals within a strain varied between the two approaches and across maximum-likelihood bootstrap replicates.Analyses consistently recovered the same relationships among the three terminal taxa [EKW (AB,TU)] across bootstrap replicates under a GTR+I+Γ model. Because AB and TU occupied a monophyletic clade that was sister to EKW, phylogenomics does not resolve the question of whether the lack of the Chr4R sex-determination locus in AB and TU is due to two independent events during their separate and independent routes to domestication in Oregon and Germany or to a single event that occurred either in nature or in the pet trade before the divergence of these two populations.Recent extractions from East India (NA, WIK, CB) were genetically distinct from the [EKW (AB,TU))]clade, although relationships among NA, WIK, and CB varied across bootstrap replicates, as evidenced by poor support of the respective internal nodes (41 and 43%, Figure 5). The inability to resolve relationships among these strains even with a large amount of available sequence data are due to variation in the placement of the root of the tree. The length of the branch between zebrafish and dwarf danio is orders of magnitude longer than the length of the internal nodes separating strains because dwarf danio lacks zebrafish-specific RAD-tags. Unfortunately, outgroups closer to zebrafish are as yet unknown.CB appears to have two subclades, suggesting population substructure within that isolate. In addition, CB harbors more genetic variation than the other strains as evidenced by the depth of the root of that strain and analysis of heterozygosity (Figure 5 and Figure S2). This result is expected for the offspring of individuals taken directly from nature.Males and females do not group separately within strains, showing that standing genetic variation in the bulk of the genome masks any sex-specific differences in the phylogenetic analyses. In sum, phylogenomics showed that each of the six strains used is a distinct population, that the most recently accessed natural strains lie basal in the tree, and that the domesticated strains AB and TU are rather closely related among the strains we tested.To determine whether our strains cover the broad diversity of zebrafish natural variation, we investigated cytb, encoded by the mitochondrial genome. Zebrafish populations collected widely across India fall into three major clades: haplogroup 1 in Northern India and Eastern and Western Nepal, haplogroup 2 in Bangladesh and Southern India, and haplogroup 3 in Central Nepal (Whiteley et al. 2011). Infrequent mitochondrial genome contamination in RAD-tag libraries allowed us to reconstruct the cytb locus and assign populations to mitochondrial clades (accession nos. KM196113–KM196120). Results (see Figure S5) identified 14 SNPs that were shared across all our strains and all fish of haplogroup 1 but were absent from all haplogroups 2 and 3, showing that NA, WIK, EKW, and CB all derived from haplogroup 1 (Whiteley et al. 2011). Among the six strains we used and the 16 populations in the Whiteley et al. (2011) study, only AB appeared in both studies, and in both cases was in haplogroup 1. We conclude that our samples represent a single branch of the broad diversity of mitochondrial lineages across the zebrafish species.RAD-sex analysis identified a 1.5-Mb interval containing a major genetic sex determinant near the telomere of zebrafish Chr4R in two natural laboratory strains (WIK and EKW) and in two recent accessions from the wild (NA and CB). These four natural strains have not been extensively manipulated for domestication and were derived from natural populations in India (NA, WIK, and CB) or are of unknown, but likely unmanipulated, origin (EKW). Results also detected sex-linked loci within a small portion of Chr14 and on several unassembled contigs and scaffolds, as might be expected if zebrafish sex phenotype is polygenic (Tong et al. 2010; Bradley et al. 2011; Anderson et al. 2012; Liew et al. 2012; Howe et al. 2013; Liew and Orban 2014). To determine whether these several sex-linked sequences represented a polygenic sex-determination system or whether they were due to errors in the genome assembly, we mapped the unassembled and Chr14 sex-linked loci on a meiotic mapping panel. Because results showed that all sex-linked sequences map to the right tip of Chr4 in Zv9, we conclude that natural wild zebrafish have a single major sex-determining region within a short segment of Chr4R, sar4.The discovery of a strongly sex-linked locus only in Chr4R in natural zebrafish raises the question of whether Chr4 is a sex chromosome. Genetically defined Chr4 (Postlethwait et al. 1994; Johnson et al. 1996) corresponds to cytogenetic chromosome 3 (Phillips et al. 2006), the right arm of which is the only arm that is late replicating and heterochromatic (Pijnacker and Ferwerda 1995; Gornung et al. 1997; Amores and Postlethwait 1999; Gornung et al. 2000; Sola and Gornung 2001; Traut and Winking 2001; Phillips et al. 2006). Chr4R is impoverished in protein-coding genes, contains most of the genome’s 5S–RNA genes, is enriched in satellite repeats, and has high GC content (Anderson et al. 2012; Howe et al. 2013); these properties are shared with sex chromosomes in other species (Peichel et al. 2004; Charlesworth et al. 2005). Finding sex-linked markers only on the sole chromosome arm with cytogenetic properties of sex chromosomes is consistent with the hypothesis that Chr4 is a sex chromosome in zebrafish.The conclusion that Chr4 is a sex chromosome raises the question of whether zebrafish has a female-XX/male-XY, a female-WZ/male-ZZ, or other type of chromosomal sex mechanism. Our population genomics and meiotic mapping both support the conclusion from testosterone-treated AB × WIK individuals (Tong et al. 2010) that females are the heterogametic sex (WZ) in natural populations of zebrafish. For the SNP that is statistically associated most strongly to sex phenotype in each natural population: (1) all individuals that were homozygous for one allele (e.g., m/m), which could be on the Z chromosome, developed as males; (2) most individuals that were heterozygous (e.g., m/f), which could represent a WZ karyotype, became females; and (3) fish that were homozygous for the allele that is not homozygous in most males (e.g., f/f fish, presumably WW) usually developed as females and were fewer than expected by random mating and equal viability. These fish would occur from the mating of a genetic (WZ) female with a, sex-reversed (WZ) phenotypic male. And (4) although some fish with a female genotype (f/m) developed as males, no individual with a male genotype (m/m) became a female. This result suggests that (5), an allele (f) is necessary but not sufficient to make a female phenotype, or the Z version of the native Chr4 has a dosage-sensitive locus for which two doses guarantees male development and one dose favors, but does not assure, female development.The dominant-female-allele hypothesis and the two-dose-male–one-dose-female hypothesis have both been described in vertebrates. A W-linked, dominantly acting truncated copy of DMRT1 triggers ovary development in the frog Xenopus laevis, likely acting as a dominant-negative inhibitor of the normal DMRT1 gene (Yoshimoto et al. 2008; Yoshimoto et al. 2010; Yoshimoto and Ito 2011). DMRT1 is also involved in sex determination in birds, but the agent is a Z-linked copy that affects sex development by a dosage-sensitive mechanism (Smith et al. 2009). The Z, but not the W, in half-smooth tongue sole has a functional copy of dmrt1, consistent with the dosage-sensitive hypothesis (Chen et al. 2014). A variant of dmrt1 is also the major Y-linked sex determinant of Japanese medaka O. latipes (Matsuda et al. 2002; Nanda et al. 2002; Kondo et al. 2006, 2009). In some species of Oryzias, variants of different genes in the sex-determination pathway, including gsdf and sox3,are at the top of the sex-determination hierarchy (Takehana et al. 2007, 2014; Kondo et al. 2009; Myosho et al. 2012; Kikuchi and Hamaguchi 2013), while in other species of fish, other genes are at the top of the hierarchy, including a variant of irf9 in trout and amhr in fugu (Kamiya et al. 2012; Yano et al. 2012). The molecular genetic nature of the zebrafish sex determinant is as yet unknown. About 80% of Chr4R genes have no apparent human ortholog and are highly duplicated, with, for example, 109 genes encoding NOD-like receptors and zinc finger proteins (Howe et al. 2013), and as discussed below, the strains from which the Zv9 zebrafish reference genome was derived lack or have a greatly modified Chr4-linked sex-determination system, making it likely that the reference genome does not contain the normal wild sex determinant.The only karyotypes known to involve zebrafish collected directly from nature (Mansar Lake, Jammu) tentatively support the WW/WZ chromosomal sex system (Sharma et al. 1998). The relevance of the Mansar Lake fish to our populations, however, is unknown. Mansar Lake is 2000 km west of Nadia, Kolkata, and Cooch Behar and the phylogenetic relationship of its zebrafish to our populations is unknown. Furthermore, the Z chromosome in Mansar Lake fish was cytogenetically much larger than the W chromosome (Sharma et al. 1998). Assuming that SbfI sites are distributed with approximately the same density across Z and W chromosomes, a large proportion of sex-linked RAD-tags should be homozygous in ZZ males and heterozygous in WZ females. In our experiments, however, only a small fraction of Chr4-linked RAD-tags fit these criteria, suggesting that our Indian populations, while maintaining a WZ/ZZ system, might have a different sex chromosome karyotype than the one suggested by published analyses of the Mansar Lake population.In contrast to natural strains, RAD-sex failed to detect any sex-linked loci in AB and TU, which is surprising given that published studies involving these strains identified sex-biasing loci. For the SATmap study, we made fully homozygous (doubled haploid) gynogenetic AB and TU fish, some of which became males and others females despite all fish having only female-derived chromosomes (Howe et al. 2013). Crossing a fully homozygous female TU fish to a fully homozygous male AB fish produced a clutch of genetically identical F1 heterozygotes, some of which became males and others females (Howe et al. 2013), showing that genetic differences are not essential for zebrafish sex determination. Apparently, in the absence of genetic differences, other forces influence zebrafish sex determination; for example, stochastic differences might cause some eggs to have less yolk than others or environmental differences might arise if late hatching larvae have less access to food; both situations would lead to poorer nutrition, slower growth, and a greater likelihood of developing as a male (Lawrence et al. 2008).To produce the F2 SATmap population, a heterozygous AB/TU F1 male was crossed to his genetically identical sister (Howe et al. 2013). Analysis identified a single significant peak linked to sex at Chr16:19 Mb–23 Mb. Homozygotes for the granddam (TU) allele were 70% likely to become female but homozygotes for the grandsire (AB) allele were only 26% likely to become female, while heterozygotes were about equally likely to be male or female (Howe et al. 2013). This result shows that a locus on Chr16 has female-favoring allele(s) in TU and/or male-favoring alleles in AB. This result does not address the question of whether sex-determination alleles are polymorphic within each strain, just that alleles differ between strains. For example, AB fish might have partially deleterious alleles at this locus so that AB homozygotes have fewer primordial germ cells, are slower developing, or are less successful at obtaining nutrition and thus more likely to become males relative to individuals homozygous for TU alleles (Lawrence et al. 2008; Siegfried and Nusslein-Volhard 2008; Rodriguez-Mari et al. 2010; Rodríguez-Marí and Postlethwait 2011; Dranow et al. 2013). In contrast, RAD-sex detects sex-linked polymorphisms segregating within a strain, not between strains. If the Chr16 sex-biasing factor that varies between AB and TU is not polymorphic within AB or within TU, our protocol would not find it. Furthermore, the failure to find sar4 in the SATmap experiments supports our finding that AB and TU lack sar4.AB and TU both experienced selection to remove preexisting mutations for mutagenesis experiments (Walker-Durchanek 1980; Streisinger et al. 1981; Mullins et al. 1994). C. Walker produced AB from 21 females derived by half-tetrad gynogenesis (Streisinger et al. 1981), which produces offspring that are homozygous except for regions distal to a recombination event; thus, half-tetrad gynogenesis might or might not eliminate heterozygosity at the distally located sar4 locus. Because homozygosity can result in male bias due to loss of fitness (Brown et al. 2012a,b), some half-tetrad animals might sex reverse to male development despite heterozygosity at sar4. The mating of a WW (or ZZ) gynogenetic female (or male) to a sex-reversed WW (or ZZ) gynogenetic male (or female) might result in the loss of the Z (or W) chromosome making a homozygous WW (or ZZ) strain. Sex-biasing alleles or environmental factors could cause some WW (or ZZ) individuals to become males (or females), allowing the strain to propagate. Researchers might select for any preexisting male- or female-biasing alleles as they set up mating pairs; eventually a new genetic sex-determining mechanism might evolve in the domesticated strain, perhaps similar to the rapid evolution of new sex chromosomes in cichlids (Roberts et al. 2009; Ser et al. 2010; Parnell and Streelman 2013).TU originated from a pet store in Germany about 1990. Mullins et al. (1994) used multiple single-pair matings to make a lethal-free strain without gynogenesis and with a conscious effort to maintain genetic variation. A hypothesis is that the major wild male or female sex determinant was linked to lethal or deleterious alleles, leading to the loss of the sex determinant along with lethal allele loss. In the absence of male or female alleles of the major sex determinant, occasional sex reversal would allow for stock maintenance, and researchers would strongly select for alleles favoring the development of both sexes. If this hypothesis were true, then the evolution of new sex determinants in TU provides a unique opportunity to study the evolution of new sex-determining mechanisms.Despite the absence of a strong sex-linked locus on Chr4, AB and TU may have retained some components of the wild sex-determination mechanism:A female-AB-by-male-IN cross (MGH cross) identified sex-linked loci at Chr5:44.5–46.6 Mb and Chr16:13–17 Mb that together account for just 16% of the variance with regard to sex (Knapik et al. 1996, 1998; Bradley et al. 2011). If the AB parental female lacked a strong female sex determinant as in our AB fish, then the MGH cross might miss sar4 even if IN females, which were not involved in the cross, do possess the natural wild sex determinant.Our female-AB-by-male-NA cross identified sex-linked loci in addition to sar4, specifically, one on Chr3, although the reciprocal cross identified only sar4 (Anderson et al. 2012).As discussed above, the female-TU-by-male-AB SATmap cross identified sex-linked loci on Chr16, but in a different location than in the MGH cross (Howe et al. 2013).The identification of autosomal sex-associated loci (Chr3, Chr5, Chr16) could represent either the unmasking of weak sex determinants given the loss of the sar4, or the rapid evolution of new sex-determination systems after the divergence of EKW, which has the Chr4R sex-determination system, from the common ancestor of AB and TU.What causes male genotypes to develop only as males but female genotypes to sometimes develop as sex-reversed phenotypes? Answers likely lie in environmental factors and background genetic features that affect the strength of a meiotic oocyte-derived pro-female signal that inhibits oocyte apoptosis, probably by maintaining aromatase production (Slanchev et al. 2005; Houwing et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2007; Siegfried and Nusslein-Volhard 2008; Rodriguez-Mari et al. 2010, 2011; Rodríguez-Marí and Postlethwait 2011; Pradhan et al. 2012; Dranow et al. 2013). In general, harsh conditions, including high density and poor nutrition, tend to promote male development (Walker-Durchanek 1980; Pelegri and Schulte-Merker 1999; Shang et al. 2006; Lawrence et al. 2008; Abozaid et al. 2011, 2012; Liew et al. 2012; Villamizar et al. 2012). These harsh factors may act to decrease the pro-female signal by depressing the pool of meiotic oocytes, either by inhibiting primary germ-cell proliferation or entry into meiosis or by promoting oocyte apoptosis. Sex reversals can happen even in species with a strong genetic sex determinant. In medaka, high temperature and hypoxia can cause female-to-male sex reversal, accompanied by increased cortisol and depressed aromatase (Sato et al. 2005; Hattori et al. 2007; Selim et al. 2009; Kitano et al. 2012; Cheung et al. 2014). It remains to be tested whether stressful conditions cause sex reversal in zebrafish by a similar mechanism.In addition to environmental factors, background genetic factors might decrease the strength of sar4 activity in domesticated stocks. Although our experiments showed that WIK has a strong sex determinant, inbreeding, which results in homozygosis of partially deleterious alleles, biases WIK fish toward male development (Brown et al. 2012a). Especially likely would be an interaction of background genotype with environmental factors that could override the influence of sar4 on phenotypic sex.Did AB and TU lose sar4 independently or was this feature present in the last common ancestor of the two strains? Phylogenomic analyses showed that AB and TU occupy a monophyletic sister clade to EKW, suggesting that AB and TU may have been derived from EKW-related fish—AB from a pet store in Oregon and TU from a pet store in Germany. By parsimony, these results do not rule out the possibility that the lack of sex-linked loci in Chr4R was a shared trait derived from the last common ancestor of AB and TU. Nevertheless, due to their independent domestication in Eugene and Tuebingen, and the presence of sar4 in EKW, we suspect that the loss of a strong sex determinant occurred independently during the separate domestication of the two lineages, a conclusion that is not incompatible with the phylogenomic data.Analysis of the mitochondrial genome-encoded cytb gene showed that our strains all derived from mitochondrial haplogroup 1, suggesting that a broader understanding of the genetics of sex determination across the full diversity of zebrafish will require investigations of haplogroups 2 and 3 (populations in Nepal and Southern India, respectively), which diverged from haplogroup 1 about 3 million years ago (Whiteley et al. 2011). Investigations of Danio species closely related to zebrafish will also add to our understanding, although the sar4 sex-determination locus may not be widely conserved with other danios. The closest lineage to zebrafish (Cypriniformes; Cyprinidae; Danio) that has a genome-wide analysis of conserved syntenies is the gudgeon (Cypriniformes; Cyprinidae; Gnathopogon) (Kakioka et al. 2013), whose lineage separated from the zebrafish lineage about 117 million years ago (Saitoh et al. 2011). Analyses showed strong conservation of syntenies among all zebrafish chromosomes except Chr4R (Kakioka et al. 2013).Results presented here show that zebrafish in nature has a strong sex determinant linked to the right tip of Chr4, the only chromosome arm with cytogenetic features frequently found in sex chromosomes; that the determinant is necessary but not sufficient for female development; and that in natural populations, females are WZ and males are ZZ. In contrast, domesticated strains cleaned of background mutations for mutagenesis experiments lack or have greatly weakened versions of the Chr4 sex-determination system.These conclusions have several important implications:Because domesticated strains make males and females (often with widely fluctuating sex ratios) even without the full complement of natural genetic sex determinants, these strains apparently have a functional sex-determining mechanism, perhaps due to polygenic sex determination unmasked by the evolutionary strengthening of weak sex-ratio modifiers under the heavy hand of “unnatural selection” wielded by zebrafish researchers, or the unmasking of latent but preexisting environmental sex-determination mechanisms.Some studies investigating the biology of zebrafish sex determination using TU and AB fish should be revisited using sex-genotyped animals from a strain that possesses the natural genetic sex determinant.Although mechanisms downstream of sar4 are likely to be the same in all zebrafish stocks, future work that includes studies of natural strains containing the wild sex determinants would provide richer understanding.The zebrafish genome sequence, which was derived mainly from TU with input from AB and substantial correction using the SATmap, is unlikely to contain strong alleles of both the male and the female alternatives of the major natural sex-determining gene.We need to concentrate efforts to identify the molecular genetic basis of wild sex in zebrafish.We thank Bill Trevarrow (Eugene Research Aquatics, LLC) for obtaining Nadia and Cooch Behar fish and Yann Guiguen and William Cresko for helpful discussions.

The upstream genes of this pathway vary from species to species during evolution. Yet, little is known about how these signaling cascades are regulated and what cellular processes are dominant in ovary–testis transformation in juvenile zebrafish. In this study, we find that the transforming gonads undergo activation of sox9a-expressing stromal cells with increased deposition of extracellular matrix and formation of degenerative compartments. This leads to follicle disassembly, oocyte degeneration, follicle cell-cyp19a1a-amh conversions, and, eventually, formation of the testis cord. In vitro primary culture of juvenile ovary tissue in gonadotropins increases cytoplasmic accumulation of sox9a and p-Erk1/2, and induces mesenchymal morphology. MAPK inhibitors (MKI), a mixture of PD98059 and U0216, eliminate the cytoplasmic distribution but do not eradicate nuclear localization of sox9a and p-Erk1/2. Nuclear p53 are relatively increased in MKI-treated cells that exhibit less spreading and reduced proliferation. Despite uniform nuclear condensation, only a fraction of cells displayed the apoptotic phenotype. These results suggest that high levels of cytoplasmic sox9a and p-Erk1/2 activity activate stromal cells and enhance the production of extracellular matrix required for testis cord formation, whereas deregulation and translocation of sox9a and p-Erk1/2 induce follicle disassembly and incomplete apoptosis associated with nuclear p53. Together with the established FSH/cAMP/MAPK/AMH pathway in mammalian granulosa and Sertoli cells, we demonstrated that the sox9 axis signaling that determines testis formation in mammals also induces zebrafish ovary–testis transition, and adds to its conserved role in sex reversal.In mammals, gonad development can be divided into two phases: formation of the indifferent genital ridge/bipotential gonad and sex differentiation.1 The indifferent gonads are initially developed from the mesothelial layer of the peritoneum. As embryos grow, some cells of mesonephric origin join the gonad ridge and form the primary sex cord. Thus, the early gonad is an undifferentiated primordium composed of bipotential somatic stem cells that are precursors for supporting cells and steroid-secreting cells. Primordial germ cells (PGCs) arise from the dorsal endoderm of the yolk sac near the allantois, migrate along the hindgut and dorsal mesentery, and eventually join the gonadal ridge.2When the PGCs reach the gonadal ridge, the supporting cell precursors become either testis-specific Sertoli cells or ovary-specific follicle (granulosa) cells. Meanwhile, the immigrating mesonephric cells give rise to peritubular myoid (PM) cells (endothelial cells that form the male-specific vasculature) and fetal steroidogenic-Leydig cells (ovarian theca cells).1, 3 Parallel to somatic precursors, PGCs differentiate into oogonia in ovarian follicles or spermatogonia in Sertoli cells dominant testis cord.Compared with mammals, fishes exhibit a striking plasticity in the sex determination process, and show a wide range of gonad differentiation mechanisms, such as hermaphroditism and gonochorism.4 Hermaphrodite fishes can have either functional male and female gonadal tissues simultaneously (synchronous) or sequentially change their sex (sequential) from male to female or from female to male. In differentiated gonochoristic species, an indifferent gonad directly differentiates into a testis or an ovary. Zebrafish are undifferentiated gonochoristic fishes: during the juvenile period,5 all individuals develop undifferentiated ovary-like gonads containing immature oocytes.6 Between 20 and 30 days post fertilization (d.p.f.), immature oocytes develop into ovaries in approximately half of the zebrafish population. In the remaining population, the immature oocytes degenerate and the gonads acquire testis morphology. Therefore, the zebrafish is an optimal model with which to investigate cell death and differentiation for sex reversal. Direct evidence for plasticity of germline stem cells comes from spermatogonial stem cell transplantation in zebrafish. Spermatogonial stem cells are able to colonize in the recipient ovaries and differentiate into female germ line cells.7Two cellular mechanisms for sex reversal have been proposed: apoptosis and transdifferentiation. The apoptosis mechanism stipulates that a large amount of oocyte apoptosis results in a weakened oocyte-derived signal and reduced aromatase expression. Consequently, in this model, testosterone is not converted to estrogen, spermatogenesis ensues, and the gonad becomes a testis. According to the transdifferentiation mechanism, follicular cells in oocyte-depleted follicles survive, proliferate, and transdifferentiate into Sertoli cells.8 There is still no direct evidence to link oocyte apoptosis to cell transformation in juvenile zebrafish gonads. Much remains to be learned about the signals activating juvenile oocyte degeneration, and the extent to which the signals involved in ovary apoptosis also contribute to ovary–testis transition.Gonadal development and sex differentiation were examined histologically. A minimum of six fish were sampled every 5 days, starting at 5 d.p.f. and continuing until 55 d.p.f. Serial sections were prepared to determine the developmental stage of the gonads (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1). At 5 d.p.f., we observed PGCs clustered in groups of 3–5 cells (Figure 1a). Flattened and basophilic somatic cells surrounded the PGC clusters (Figure 1a). By 11 d.p.f., the number of germ cells increased, and some PGCs began to differentiate into gonocytes (Gc) that possess rather homogeneous, slightly basophilic karyoplasm, and contain one or more nucleoli in the large nucleus (Figure 1a). Almost at the same time, nucleus-condensed cells (Cn), Gc containing a nucleus with condensed chromatin, appeared. The morphological characteristics of Cn were recognized as entry into meiosis. At this stage, the gonads containing both Gc and Cn were categorized as indifferent gonads, because male- and female-specific Gc of fishes are difficult to differentiate solely based on cell morphological characteristics.Gonadal development and differentiation. Indifferent gonad (a), only primordial germ cells (PGCs) are found in the gonad at 5 d.p.f. PGCs contain a large nucleus and possess a distinct nuclear membrane, several big nucleoli, and a network of fine chromatin filaments distributed throughout the karyoplasm. Along the inner side of the nuclear membrane, deeply staining granulosa material is seen. The weakly stained cytoplasm accounts for only a small fraction of the cell volume. At 7 d.p.f., PGCs differentiate into gonocytes (Gc). At 11 d.p.f., more Gcs and meiotic gonocytes with condensed chromatin (Cn) are seen, in addition to PGCs. At 17 d.p.f., early perinucleolar oocytes (EPOs) appear. During juvenile gonadal differentiation toward the ovary (b), more meiotic germ cells are seen (23 d.p.f.), showing densely packed oocytes (27 d.p.f.) and tight connections between late perinucleolar oocytes (LPOs) at 35 d.p.f. In the presumptive testis (c), stromal cells increase and oocyte degenerations appear as acid staining cells (Ac). Sc, spermatogonia cyst. Scale bar=20 μmSex differentiation began as early as 17 d.p.f., as indicated by the appearance of perinucleolar oocytes (POs; Figure 1a). As the gonads grew into juvenile ovaries from 20 to 25 d.p.f., the number and size of POs increased and somatic cells were located mainly at the gonadal periphery. By quantifying the number of both germ and somatic cells in the gonads, we found that the ratio of meiotic Gc and POs to total gonadal cells was significantly different, such that individual fishes could be divided into two sex populations. At 20 d.p.f., the majority of the cells in the ‘presumptive ovary’ group were meiotic germ cells that became condensed POs at 40 d.p.f. (Figure 1b and Supplementary Figure 1g). The early gonads showed normal (i.e., nontransforming) ovaries and progressed into maturation (Supplementary Figure 1j and 1). Asynchronous cell growth and delayed germ cell differentiation occurred in the ‘presumptive testis’ group: fewer POs and more proliferating somatic cells were observed (Figure 1c and Supplementary Figure 1c and e). From 25 to 55 d.p.f., the gonads underwent ovary-to-testis transformation and testicular cord (Tc) morphogenesis (Supplementary Figure 1h and i). Although the time course of gonadal development (Figure 2) was generally consistent with previous descriptions,6 our histological analysis revealed biased sex differentiation toward either the presumptive testis or ovary at the very beginning of juvenile gonadal development.Time course of gonadal development. Before 17 d.p.f., the gonad is indifferent and contains PGCs, Gc, Cn, and perinucleolar oocytes (POs). The gonad commits into sex differentiation at 17 d.p.f. and becomes mature at 35 d.p.f. The interval between 17 and 35 d.p.f. is referred to as the juvenile period, in which the gonad is identified as presumptive ovary or presumptive testis. The presumptive testis must undergo an ovary–testis transition before maturationIn contrast to the nontransforming gonads, in which POs progress through meiosis and maturation, the transforming gonads showed activation of somatic stem cells (Figure 1c). The activated stromal cells and increased extracellular matrix (ECM) infiltrated the ovarian cavity and encapsulated the meiotic Gc (Figure 1c), accompanied by the development of spermatogonia cysts (Sc) and the degeneration of oocytes. Oocyte degeneration was evidenced by the appearance of red staining acidic body (presumably apoptotic body) and vacuolated oocytes (Figure 1c). The degenerating oocytes were surrounded by the increased gonadal matrix and mesenchymalized stromal cells and formed a degenerative structure, termed degenerative compartment hereafter (Figure 3a).Morphological alterations from ovarian follicle to testis cord. (a) Active stromal cells surround the giant oocytes (Go) and form degenerative compartment (a). Within the degenerative compartment, follicle cells dissociate from the oocytes (b) and acquire mesenchymal morphology (arrow, a). (c) Degeneration of perinucleolar oocytes (primordial follicles) with marked vacuolation and survival cells from the oocyte decomposition (arrowhead). (d) Coexistence of oocyte degeneration and multinucleated giant cells (Mn) that present many peripheral nuclei and annular chromatin. (e) Regeneration of testis cord tissues. Ac, acidic cells with red coloration; Sc, spermatogenic cysts; Sp, spermatogonia; Tc, testis cord-like structure. Scale bars= 20 μm (b, and d) and 50 μm (a, c and e)Within the degenerative compartments, several cellular changes were observed. First, the follicle cells lost their tight junctions with adjacent cells and detached from the encapsulated oocyte, implying a preparation for eccentric migration and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Figures 3c and d). This extrapolation was based on the fact that granulosa cells are epithelial cells, and morphologically distinct from the stromal cells of mesenchymal origin.8 Second, the dissociated oocytes displayed apoptotic morphology with condensation of chromatin and a marked vacuolation. However, nuclear fragmentation and apoptotic bodies were not frequently observed (Figures 3a–e). There were no signs of phagocytosis from neighboring somatic cells, although a few lysosome-like structures with red coloration were seen (Figures 3b and e). Third, many cells retained intact morphology although the disassembled follicles exhibited various degrees of degeneration and decomposition (Figures 3a and c). In the vicinity of the degenerating oocytes, there were proliferating stromal cells, Sc, and a multinucleated giant cell (Mn), displaying gross morphological characteristics of Tc (Figures 3d and e). As degenerating oocytes and newly regenerating testis tissues coexisted in the transforming gonads, it was unclear whether the testis tissues were transformed from the degenerative follicles or regenerated from the reserved stem cells.To characterize the cellular phenotypes within the transforming gonads, we used sox9a, amh, and cyp19a1a to identify Sertoli and granulosa cells, and vasa to mark live germ stem cells. Relative to high expression of vasa in the nontransforming gonads (Figure 4a), the expression of vasa in the transforming gonads displayed weak and circular dot patterns in POs (Figure 4c). As previously reported in the vasa::egfp transgenic line,9 transforming gonads showed increased expression of sox9a and amh and decreased expression of cyp19a1a and vasa, compared with the nontransforming gonads (Figures 4a–d). To further understand the relationship between amh-expressing cells and cyp19a1a-expressing cells within the transforming gonads, we compared the expression of cyp19a1a and amh in adjacent sections of the same transforming gonads. It was frequently observed that both markers were coexpressed in the same ovarian follicle. Although cyp19a1a expression was downregulated, amh expression became increased (Figures 4e and f). Thus, ovary–testis transition was evidenced by switching cyp19a1a-expressing cells to amh-expressing cells.Comparative analysis of the expression pattern of multiple sex determinant genes between transforming and nontransforming gonads at 35 d.p.f. In the nontransforming gonads, vasa (a) was highly expressed whereas sox9a (b) expression was restricted in the two sides of the gonadal somatic cells. The transforming gonads revealed distinct expression patterns for vasa (c), sox9a (d), amh (e), cyp19a1a (f), and dzip1 (g and h). amh, cyp19a, and sox9a were expressed in somatic cells (supporting cells) located in the gonadal matrix and surrounding the oocytes. dzip1 was highly expressed in both spermatogonia and supporting cells. (e and f) Two adjacent sections with low levels of cyp19a1a and high levels of amh expressed with partial overlap in the same follicles (asterisk). Abnormally expressing aggregates in degenerative compartment (Dc) are indicated by the arrow. TUNEL staining assay showed the larger TUNEL-positive cells were consistent with degenerative oocytes (i). Hoechst staining (j) was used to count total number of gonadal cells. Go, giant oocyte; Mn, multinucleated giant cells; PO, perinucleolar oocyte. Scale bars=20 μmAs other studies of cellular plasticity have suggested, the ability of follicular cells to switch to their testis counterparts may reflect the similar embryonic origin of these two cell types.8 There is evidence that pre-Sertoli cells, Sertoli cells, and granulosa cells share a common precursor in mice.10, 11 To test this possibility in zebrafish, we selected 19 genes associated with sex-differentiation and examined their expression pattern during gonad development (Supplementary Tables 1–3). In comparison, the transcript levels of amh and dzip1 were relatively higher in the testis, whereas the expressions of pou5f1, nanos3, dazap2, na5a2, nr5a1b, and cyp19a1a were predominant in the ovary.We then analyzed the location of RNA expression in testis and ovary. In contrast to amh and cyp19a1a for which sexually dimorphic expression patterns are confined to somatic cells (Supplementary Figure 3a), dzip1 and nanos3 were expressed in both gonadal somatic cells and germ cells. Using vasa expression as a control, nanos3 was predominantly expressed in the oocyte proper as well as the granulosa cells, but also expressed specifically by germ cells at varying stages of spermatogenesis (Supplementary Figure 3b). Dzip1 colocalized with dazl in oocytes and granulosa cells in the follicles, but was predominantly expressed in testis cord-localized premeiotic spermatogonia (Supplementary Figure 3c). Based on their expression bias in both testis and ovary, and known stem cell-association properties,12 we consider dzip1 and nona3 to be the common markers of germ cells and supporting cells that preferentially develop into testis and ovary.We then extended our analysis retrospectively to determine whether these genes are expressed in earlier developing embryos. As expected, vasa-expressing cells migrated and resided in the presumptive gonads. Pou5f1, nanos3, and dzip1 were highly expressed in developing tissues (Supplementary Figure 3d). In the juvenile transforming gonads, dzip1 was strongly expressed in the Sc and the surrounding supporting cells (Figure 4g), even in the degenerative compartment (Dc) (Figure 4h). Nanos3 expression was detected in the degenerated oocyte (data not shown). The upregulation of dzip1, a stem cell-associated marker, in the supporting cells of the degenerating follicles implies that the follicle cell transition from cyp19a1a to amh may go through the transdifferentiation process.We defined ‘stromal cell activation’ as the combinatory effect of cell proliferation (such as increase in the number of stromal cells), and migration with mesenchymal morphology. Having determined that stromal cell activation was the first step in initiating ovary–testis transformation, we then compared the activation of stromal cells with the expression of sox9a. In the transforming gonads, sox9a-expressing cells were no longer restricted to the gonadal periphery, but infiltrated into the interior gonadal stroma and surrounded the oocytes. Unlike the dot expression pattern of vasa, amh, and cyp19a1a, sox9a-expression showed increased cytoplasmic distribution with mesenchymal morphology (Figure 4d). As the sox9-expressing cells and the active stromal cells showed similar mesenchymal morphology and topographic distribution in the transforming gonads (Figure 3c vs 4d), we conclude that sox9a-expressing stromal cells or pre-Sertoli cells were first activated to trigger ovary–testis transformation.To determine whether and to what degree the degenerating follicles undergo apoptosis, we examined and quantified the degeneration of gonadal cells from 20 to 35 d.p.f. using the terminal dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) method (Supplementary Figure 2 and Figures 4i and j). Of all DAPI staining gonadal cells, ∼10% were TUNEL-positive cells in the presumptive male group by 32 d.p.f., whereas only a small proportion of TUNEL-positive cells contained the typical apoptotic bodies (Supplementary Figure 2). TUNEL-positive somatic cells were observed. Although TUNEL-positive cells were more numerous than the morphologically degenerative oocytes, many degenerative follicles were TUNEL negative. We also saw substantial nuclear staining with irregular shapes of vasa expression (Figure 4c) and amh expression within Dc (Figure 4e). This abnormal staining shape with a high level of vasa- and amh-RNA expression was in accordance with the histological observations that many cells survived the degeneration. This finding further suggests that many cells are at the pre-apoptotic stage, a transient state of cell morphology for subsequent cell transformation or complete apoptosis. Thereafter, we referred to this as partial apoptosis and referred to partial cellular transformation as incomplete apoptosis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that weak expressions of Mek1/2, phosphorylated Mek1/2 (p-Mek1/2), sox9a, and p53 were widely detected. Only a fraction of oocytes and the surrounding follicle cells (presumably transforming follicles) showed an increase of staining intensity (Supplementary Figure 4). These results suggest a functional link between p53 and MAPK components and sox9a-amh/cyp19a1a pathways during gonadal transitions from protogenic ovary to early testis.Although histomorphological and histo-in situ hybridization analyses indicated that degeneration and transformation were likely induced by MAPK-sox9a/p53 pathways, it is still unclear how these pathways are regulated during the juvenile ovary–testis transformation. To this end, we used a mammalian growth factor, human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), to mimic follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) activity, and cultured the gonad tissues in the modified culture system. Rather than performing in vitro culture of entire gonad,13 we sliced the gonad tissue into small pieces. On the fourth day, a monolayer of adherent fibroblast-like cells grew from the periphery of the primary explants. We then added activator-dcAMP and/or MKI (MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) inhibitor) and continued the culture for 48 h. Gonadotropin and cAMP induced mesenchymal morphology, cell spreading, and proliferation of the cultured primary cells. In contrast, MKI inhibited proliferation and cell spreading, and repressed sox9a and amh transcriptions (Supplementary Figure 5, data not shown). These results were consistent with the in vivo histological observations that the sox9a axis pathways increase ECM production and mesenchymal morphological transformation of gonadal cells.We next examined how the sox9a pathways linked oocyte apoptosis to cellular transformation. Without MKI treatment, the cultured cells exhibited mesenchymal morphology with abundant extracellular matrix. Sox9a and phosphorylated Erk1/2 (p-Erk1/2) were highly expressed in the cytoplasm. Similar phenotypes were observed in sox9-activated stromal cells of the transforming gonads (Figures 3a and 4d). After MKI treatment, levels of sox9a and p-Erk1/2 were dramatically decreased in the cytoplasm, whereas nuclear sox9a and p-Erk1/2 showed little reduction. In contrast, levels of p53 increased in the nuclei, and cell number decreased. Deregulation and translocation of Erk1/2, p-Erk1/2, sox9a, and p53 were indicated by changes of signal intensity (mean values) and size measurement (pixel values) of immunostaining images (Figure 5 and Table 1). The MKI-treated cells became uniformly round with nuclear condensation, and partially apoptotic with fragmented nuclei (Figure 5). These results suggest that cytoplasmic p-Erk1/2 and sox9a activate stromal cells and promote ECM production, whereas reduced p-Erk1/2 activity deregulate expression and translocation of sox9a and p53, and induce partial apoptosis and cellular transformation (Figure 6).Involvement of MAPK-sox9a and p53 pathways in morphological alterations of cultured gonadal tissue. Ovary tissues were sliced and cultured in vitro. After 2–3 days, MKI or DMSO control were added and tissues were incubated for 48 h. The cultures were costained with Erk1/2 and p-Erk1/2 antibodies (left two columns) or costained with sox9a and p53 antibodies (right two columns). DAPI staining and DOC were seen. Apoptotic or degenerating cells (arrow) and related signal staining (dotted circle) are shown. Scale bars=20 μmA proposed model that FSH-MAPK-sox9a/p53 signaling pathways regulate juvenile ovary–testis transition in zebrafish. In the stromal cells of the presumptive testis group, juvenile FSH upregulates sox9a expression and cytoplasmic distribution through phosphorylation of Mek1/2–Erk1/2 signaling. Activated stromal cells and increased ECM form gonad matrix that grows as testis cord-like spermatogenic cysts or becomes degenerative compartments that surround the ovarian follicles. Within the degenerative compartments, p-Erk1/2 and sox9a are reduced, particularly in cytoplasm whereas sox9a and p53 in nucleus are relatively increased. Misexpression and translocation of sox9a deregulates the expression of amh/cyp19a1a and induces the follicle disassembly. Meanwhile, nuclear p53 promotes degeneration of the disassociated follicle cells, leading to incomplete apoptosis. Finally, these incompletely apoptotic cells are either transformed to testis cord or die. It is uncertain how p53 is regulated by sox9a and p-Erk1/2 are interplayed in the transforming gonadsIn juvenile zebrafish, the gonadal transition from ovary-like tissue to testis is reminiscent of the sex-specific timing of meiosis entry in mammals. Female PGCs (oogonia) first enter meiosis at birth and undergo oogenesis during juvenile development. In contrast, male PGCs (spermatogonia) do not enter meiosis and spermatogenesis until puberty. It has been proposed that germ stem cells are driven to enter meiosis by an intrinsic clock. Signals produced by the male-specific somatic cells inhibit Gc from entering meiosis, arresting Gc in G1/G0 and directing them toward spermatogenesis. Like many other species, zebrafish do not have obvious sexually dimorphic chromosomes; instead, multiple sex determination loci14, 15, 16 have been identified to be responsible for sex-associated effects. This study presents compelling evidence that sox9a axis pathways orchestrate the supporting cell-dominated transition from ovary to testis.In the testes, sox9a is an upstream positive regulator of amh that, in turn, is an upstream negative regulator of cyp19a1a.17 In the ovary, AMH inhibits primordial follicle assembly.13 Although the regulatory interactions of sox9a-amh/cyp19a1a have been extensively investigated, it is unclear whether and how this pathway is regulated to implement the juvenile ovary–testis transformation in zebrafish. The present study showed that upregulation of sox9a activated stromal cells, increased extracellular matrix production, proceeded follicle cell-cyp19a1a-amh conversions, and induced ovarian follicle degeneration and testis cord generation. This somatic cell-dominated sex differentiation model expands the previous hypothesis that ovarian fate is passively determined by a threshold number of developing oocytes;18 that is, a number of oocytes exceeding the threshold activate the female pathway, whereas a number of oocytes under the threshold induce the male pathway.18 The loss of female germ cells, by either injecting dnd antisense morpholino or mutating sox9b,19 induces female-to-male sex reversal. Loss of germ cells is not an adequate mechanism to explain zebrafish juvenile ovary–testis transition, however. We demonstrated that this transition is regulated by FSH/cAMP/MAPK-sox9 pathway.In humans and mice, FSH induces upregulation of AMH expression in Sertoli cells and granulosa cells via its second messenger cAMP.20, 21 FSH induces an adenylyl cyclase-dependent increase in cAMP levels that activate several kinases in the PKA, PI3K/PKB, p38 MAPK, and MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathways.9, 13, 20 Here, we propose a novel mechanism to explain how the degenerative oocytes undergo incomplete apoptosis and transform into testis cords during juvenile ovary–testis transition (Figure 6). According to this model, juvenile FSH upregulates sox9a expression and distribution in presumptive testis stromal cells via Mek1/2-Erk1/2 pathways. Cytoplasmic sox9a activates stromal cells to form degenerative compartments that surround the ovarian follicles. Because of a blocked blood supply, or other unknown factors within the degenerative compartments, Erk1/2 activity and cytoplasmic sox9a are dramatically reduced with relative increases of nuclear sox9a and p53. Deregulated expression of sox9a and p53 coordinately induce follicle disassembly, apoptotic processes, and cellular transformations.Germ cell development is unique in that the cells progress through meiosis and break double-strand DNA for homologous recombination. Therefore, maintenance of genome stability in germ cells is required for normal gonad development.18, 22 Tp53 (p53) has been reported to mediate germ cell apoptosis and regulate oocyte survival through meiosis.18, 22 On this basis, we theorized that preapoptotic cells might undergo DNA repair through meiotic homologous recombination or mitotic recombination. The recombination provides an opportunity for cells to undergo either transformation or apoptosis. As meiosis is a ‘one-way’ process for germ cell division and cannot engage in a cell cycle as mitosis does, oocyte degeneration and programmed cell death are regarded as their final fate.In summary, gene expression analyses in zebrafish have already revealed the conservation of structure, function, and expression of a large number of mammalian genes at the downstream of the sex determination pathway, including cyp19a1a, sox9a, and amh.9, 13, 20 Our results support the idea that sox9 is a fundamental testis-differentiating gene common to all vertebrates.23, 24 We demonstrated that sox9a expression pattern closely correlates with the behavior of the stromal cells in gonadal tissue of juvenile zebrafish. High level of cytoplasmic sox9a expression promotes cellular proliferation, mesenchymal transformation, and ECM deposition, whereas misexpression of sox9a induces p53-associated follicle degeneration and cell transformation. Obviously, the expression and nuclear translocation of sox9a and p53 are regulated by Mek1/2–Erk1/2 MAPK signaling. The exact regulatory mechanisms in MAPK-sox9/p53 pathway remain for further investigations. Therefore, the manipulation of sex determination might be possible via indirectly disrupting upstream regulatory pathways of Sox9a.Zebrafish TAB lines (hybrid from AB and Tubingen lines) were maintained under an ambient temperature of 27 °C with a timer-controlled light period of 14 h light and 10 h dark. All experiments were performed in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines of the Shanghai Ocean University.Fish were anesthetized in 0.1% tricaine (3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl-ester methanesulphonate salt; Sigma, Poole, UK) in filtered system water. Gonads were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE).25 For TUNEL staining, paraffin-embedded sections were created following the manufacturer’s protocol and subsequently stained in DAPI (Invitrogen Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 5 min, followed by two rinses in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min. After photography, the sections were counterstained with HE, and photographed.Whole-mount in situ hybridization and histological in situ hybridization experiments were conducted as described previously.25 Complementary DNAs corresponding to the target genes were used to generate riboprobes.Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously.26 Antibodies used for the study include sox9a antibody (ab82578), anti-Erk1+Erk2 antibody (ab54230), phosphorylated Erk1+Erk2 (Phospho T202+Y204) antibody (ab76165), and p53 antibody (ab77813). Fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit IG-FITC (ab6717), goat anti-mouse IgG-TR (ab6787), Dylight 594 rabbit anti-goat IgG (RAG5942), Dylight488 goat anti-mouse IgG (GAM4882), Dylight549, and goat anti-rabbit (GAR5492), were purchased from Abcam (Hong Kong) Ltd (Hong Kong) or Beijing CoWin Biotech Co., Ltd (Beijing, China). The sections were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) and then mounted with prolong antifade reagent (Invitrogen P7481).To localize and quantify gene expression, color intensity of the immunostaining signals were quantified by using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). The image was first converted as grayscale mode. The lasso tool palette was then used to draw a line around the edges of the cell. After opening the image-histogram window, the values for the selection were recorded as mean, S.D., median and pixels. The same procedure was repeated to collect background intensity. After subtracting the background signals, the remaining signal values represented the immunostaining intensity for the specific antibody in the selected cell. For each image, we collected histogram information from five cells and input the values in Excel spreadsheet. To perform comparison and data analyses we selected two parameters: the mean to represent the average gray value for the area inside the selection, and the pixel values to measure the image size.Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed to cDNA with Transcript II two-step RT-PCR supermix (Transgen Biotech, Beijing, China) in the presence of oligo (dT) 20 primer. Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out using 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and data analyses were performed as previously described.25, 27 Oligonucleotide primers (listed in Supplementary Table 2) were synthesized by Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Technology and Service Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China).Basic gonadal tissue culture medium (GTCM) was based on the zebrafish testis and ovary growth medium in the previous reports.23 L-15 (Leibovitz’s L-15 medium, Gibco, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Gibco), 100 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate (Gibco), and 20% AmnioPAN complete medium (PAN Biotech GmbH, Aidenbach, Germany) with and without 10 IU/ml HCG (Sigma). After anesthesia with 0.1% tricaine, testes or ovary were removed from 2–3-month-old adult fish and sliced into 1.5 mm sections.3 The gonadal fragments were then plated on gelatin-coated Labteck dishes and incubated at 28 °C in air. After culture, the cells were fixed in 2% buffered paraformaldehyde for 2 h, and permeabilized with 0.2% PBT (0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 10 min. The slides were ready for RNA in situ hybridization, HE staining, or immunostaining. Monoethanolate (U0126), 2-2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl (PD098), and cAMP (D0627) were purchased from Sigma and used at final concentrations of 20 μm, 10 μm, and 1 mM, respectively.MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) inhibitorphosphorylated Erk1/2phosphorylated Mek1/2human chorionic gonadotropinfollicle-stimulating hormoneprimordial germ celldays post fertilizationgonocytesnucleus-condensed cellsperinucleolar oocytetesticular cordspermatogonia cystsmultinucleated giant celldegenerative compartmentbasic gonadal tissue culture mediumepithelial–mesenchymal transitionextracellular matrixhematoxylin and eosinterminal dUTP nick end-labelingWilhelm D, Palmer S, Koopman P .

Recently, new technology for gene targeting using engineered zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) has been described in fish species. However, it has not yet been widely used for cold water and slow developing species, such as Salmonidae. Here, we present the results of successful ZFN-mediated disruption of the sex-determining gene sdY (sexually dimorphic on the Y chromosome) in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Three pairs of ZFN mRNA targeted to different regions of the sdY gene were injected into fertilized rainbow trout eggs. Sperm from 1-year-old male founders (parental generation one or P1) carrying a ZFN-induced mutation in their germline were then used to produce F1 non-mosaic animals. In these F1 populations, we characterized 14 different mutations in the sdY gene, including one mutation leading to the deletion of leucine 43 (L43) and 13 mutations at other target sites that had different effects on the SdY protein, i.e., amino acid insertions, deletions, and frameshift mutations producing premature stop codons in the mRNA. The gonadal phenotype analysis of the F1-mutated animals revealed that the single L43 amino acid deletion did not lead to a male-to-female sex reversal, but all other mutations induced a clear ovarian phenotype. These results show that targeted gene disruption using ZFN is efficient in rainbow trout but depends on the ZFN design. We also characterized new sdY mutations resulting in male-to-female sex reversal, and we conclude that L43 seems dispensable for SdY function.This is a preview of subscription content, log in to check access.Amacher SL (2008) Emerging gene knockout technology in zebrafish: zinc-finger nucleases.

Part of Springer Nature.The presence of germ cells in the early gonad is important for sexual fate determination and gonadal development in vertebrates. Recent studies in zebrafish and medaka have shown that a lack of germ cells in the early gonad induces sex reversal in favor of a male phenotype. However, it is uncertain whether the gonadal somatic cells or the germ cells are predominant in determining gonadal fate in other vertebrate. Here, we investigated the role of germ cells in gonadal differentiation in goldfish, a gonochoristic species that possesses an XX–XY genetic sex determination system. The primordial germ cells (PGCs) of the fish were eliminated during embryogenesis by injection of a morpholino oligonucleotide against the dead end gene. Fish without germ cells showed two types of gonadal morphology: one with an ovarian cavity; the other with seminiferous tubules. Next, we tested whether function could be restored to these empty gonads by transplantation of a single PGC into each embryo, and also determined the gonadal sex of the resulting germline chimeras. Transplantation of a single GFP-labeled PGC successfully produced a germline chimera in 42.7% of the embryos. Some of the adult germline chimeras had a developed gonad on one side that contained donor derived germ cells, while the contralateral gonad lacked any early germ cell stages. Female germline chimeras possessed a normal ovary and a germ-cell free ovary-like structure on the contralateral side; this structure was similar to those seen in female morphants. Male germline chimeras possessed a testis and a contralateral empty testis that contained some sperm in the tubular lumens. Analysis of aromatase, foxl2 and amh expression in gonads of morphants and germline chimeras suggested that somatic transdifferentiation did not occur. The offspring of fertile germline chimeras all had the donor-derived phenotype, indicating that germline replacement had occurred and that the transplanted PGC had rescued both female and male gonadal function. These findings suggest that the absence of germ cells did not affect the pathway for ovary or testis development and that phenotypic sex in goldfish is determined by somatic cells under genetic sex control rather than an interaction between the germ cells and somatic cells.► Germ cell free gonads transdifferentiate to testes in zebrafish and medaka. ► By contrast, sex differentiation in goldfish is controlled by gonadal somatic cells. ► Developmental pathway fate is independent of germ cells in goldfish. ► Complete replacement of host germline can be induced by PGC transplantation.Current address: South Ehime Fisheries Research Center, Ehime University, 1289-1 Funakoshi, Ainan, Ehime, 798-4292 Japan.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Bone marrow transplants improve hematopoietic phenotypes but do not prevent other cancers. FA arises from mutation in any of the 15 FANC genes that cooperate to repair double stranded DNA breaks by homologous recombination. Zebrafish has a single ortholog of each human FANC gene and unexpectedly, mutations in at least two of them (fancl and fancd1(brca2)) lead to female-to-male sex reversal. Investigations show that, as in human, zebrafish fanc genes are required for genome stability and for suppressing apoptosis in tissue culture cells, in embryos treated with DNA damaging agents, and in meiotic germ cells. The sex reversal phenotype requires the action of Tp53 (p53), an activator of apoptosis. These results suggest that in normal sex determination, zebrafish oocytes passing through meiosis signal the gonadal soma to maintain expression of aromatase, an enzyme that converts androgen to estrogen, thereby feminizing the gonad and the individual. According to this model, normal male and female zebrafish differ in genetic factors that control the strength of the late meiotic oocyte-derived signal, probably by regulating the number of meiotic oocytes, which environmental factors can also alter. Transcripts from fancd1(brca2) localize at the animal pole of the zebrafish oocyte cytoplasm and are required for normal oocyte nuclear architecture, for normal embryonic development, and for preventing ovarian tumors. Embryonic DNA repair and sex reversal phenotypes provide assays for the screening of small molecule libraries for therapeutic substances for FA.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Both genetic and temperature-dependent systems of sex determination have been described in teleost fish. In the common zebrafish model organism, heteromorphic sex chromosomes are not observed, and the potential role of a genetic component of sex determination remains largely unknown. Here we report a genome-wide linkage study of sex determination in zebrafish using a novel SNP genetic map. We identified loci on zebrafish chromosomes 5 (LOD score 7.9) and 16 (LOD score 9.3) governing sex determination as a complex trait, rather than as an XY or ZW genetic system. Each of these loci contains a prominent candidate gene with a conserved role in sex determination across additional species that suggest potential mechanisms of sex determination in zebrafish. The chromosome 5 locus harbors dmrt1, a key gene in sex determination from fruit flies to humans; mutation of the human DMRT1 ortholog is a cause of complete sex reversal of XY individuals. The chromosome 16 locus harbors cyp21a2; mutation of the human CYP21A2 ortholog is one of the more common causes of pseudohermaphroditism. Mutation detection at each of these candidate genes within the zebrafish cross identified hypomorphic variants on the female-associated allele of each locus. The two loci together accounted for 16% of variance of the trait. Interacting environmental cues are likely to be an additional important component of sex determination in zebrafish.Over the prior two decades, the zebrafish has become an increasingly important vertebrate model organism. The power of this model organism as a genetic system is notable; with thousands of progeny in a single generation, the large number of recombination events can lead to the identification of loci underlying a trait with high statistical confidence. In this study, we sought to identify genes contributing to sex determination in zebrafish by genome-wide linkage analysis employing a novel SNP genetic map. No prior investigation has elucidated genetic sex determination (GSD) or identified sex-linked markers in the zebrafish. Although the zebrafish does not have heteromorphic sex chromosomes (Amores and Postlethwait 1999; Sola and Gornung 2001), the possibility of homomorphic sex chromosomes such as the X and Y of medaka fish remained (Matsuda et al. 2002). Alternatively, sex determination in zebrafish might result from the interaction of a more complex genetic system with environmental factors such as temperature. In some species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), key required genes prove to be the same as those required for GSD (Ferguson-Smith 2007; Marshall Graves 2008; Shoemaker-Daly et al. 2010). The mechanisms for their control appear to have evolved distinctly. Because different species of fish have evolved that represent both XY and ZW GSD, as well as TSD mechanisms, fish are particularly suited to the study of sex determination.Methods for SNP discovery have previously been described elsewhere in detail (Bradley et al. 2007). In brief, non-unique regions of the zebrafish genome assembly were identified using the BLAST algorithm to create a zebrafish repeat database. Clone sequence and whole genome shotgun sequence produced by the Danio rerio Sequencing Group at the Sanger Institute was obtained from online databases. Finished clones were masked using the repeat database, and were then compared to shotgun sequence by BLAST to identify sequence mismatches. Each variant was then scored to highlight those candidate SNPs with only two alleles that were seen in similar proportions, and at regions sampled with greater frequency. Polymorphism of candidate SNPs was evaluated within a sample of zebrafish comprised of: 1) the MGH cross G0 fish, 2) one male C32 and one male SJD fish, and 3) four males and four females from each of the strains AB, IN, TL, TU, and WIK. Among 5321 candidate SNPs successfully converting for assay, a score of ≥4 corresponded empirically to an 86% validation rate; a score of ≥6 corresponded to a 93% validation rate. All candidate SNPs of score ≥4 have been submitted to dbSNP (ss48400959-ss49840083 and ss192416505-ss193075580, discontinuous).Frozen AB (n = 8), TL (n = 8), TU (n = 8), and WIK (n = 8) strain fish were provided by the Zebrafish International Resource Center (University of Oregon, Eugene, OR). Frozen IN (n = 8) population fish were provided by the Vanderbilt Zebrafish Core Facility. For each strain, half of the fish were of each sex. The fish of a given strain were offspring from 25 or more group matings of wild-type fish. Each group mating consisted of two females and three males. Frozen fish of each of the partially inbred strains SJD and C32 were provided by Dr. Stephen Johnson. Genomic DNA was extracted using the PureGene Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN). DNA was quantified by PicoGreen assay (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).SNP genotyping was conducted using the commercial Illumina GoldenGate assay (Illumina, San Diego, CA). We obtained 99.2% of the genotypes for polymorphic SNPs. Five DNA samples from the MGH cross accounted for 99.4% of the missing data. These were omitted from analysis. For informative SNPs within the MGH cross, 446,994 of 451,360 genotypes (99.0%) were successfully obtained.The MGH cross design has been previously described (Knapik et al. 1996; Knapik et al. 1998; Shimoda et al. 1999). Briefly, a female AB strain fish originating from the University of Oregon zebrafish facility and a male India (IN) strain fish originating from a collection of wild fish from the northeast of India were mated to produce a single F1 pair, from which 790 F2 progeny were derived. A subset of 520 were selected for which DNA preparations were of high-quality; the 44 F2 progeny employed for the MGH linkage map were a subset of these. MapManager QTXb20 (Manly et al. 2001) was initially used to construct a comprehensive map of the SNP and STR markers, based upon the 44 fish with complete genotype data. This employed the Kosambi map function for the line cross and allowed for segregation distortion, with a P = 1.0E-6 threshold. R/qtl (Broman et al. 2003) was then used to refine marker order and estimate inter-marker distances, using the full set of 520 fish. This genetic map included both STR (1.2 cM resolution) and SNP (0.1 cM resolution) data. Linkage analysis to identify sex-determining loci was also conducted in the R/qtl environment, using a variant of interval mapping appropriate for a binary trait (Broman 2003). Statistical significance for linkage to sex was established via a permutation test (Churchill and Doerge 1994), with 10,000 permutation replicates. Percent phenotypic variance attributable to a locus was estimated by modeling the binary trait as continuous.Statistically unlikely events such as double crossovers in adjacent intervals or single crossovers in a small interval in both maternal and paternal meioses were identified using a maximum likelihood approach (Lincoln and Lander 1992). A total of 223 SNP genotypes (0.05%) at internal map loci were flagged as potential errors by calculating the LODerror. This rate matches the genotyping accuracy of the Illumina system. The SNP with the greatest number of potential errors had nine genotypes flagged. For STRs at internal map loci, a single genotype (0.001%) was flagged as a potential error. No markers were excluded on the basis of potential genotyping error. We noted seven regions in each of which STR marker order may be inverted with equal probability: pairs of vectors represented by STR markers of chromosomes 2 (Z9234 and Z4586, a 0.8 cM interval), 4 (Z9667 and Z45710, a 1.1 cM interval), 8 (Z14917 and Z28258, a 1.1-cM interval), 12 (Z3690 and Z7328, a 2.3-cM interval), 12 (Z9416 and Z22666, a 1.1-cM interval), 18 (Z9154 and Z25764, a 2.0-cM interval), and 25 (Z13622 and Z6924, a 1.1-cM interval). The merged SNP and STR map, and individual genotype vectors have been provided to the Zebrafish Information Network. Additional detail of the map and markers is available at http://dna.mc.vanderbilt.edu/zbase, and in Table S1.We estimated the recombination rate along the chromosomes (in cM per Mb) using a sliding window of 5 Mb, based upon the merged SNP-STR genetic map and the Zv9 draft assembly. The analysis is restricted to markers with concordant chromosomal assignment and order in the genetic and physical maps.Primers for a series of overlapping amplimers were designed such that the amplimers stair-stepped across Zv8 chromosome 5 from 43,945,234 bp to 44,017,451 bp, and chromosome 16 from 15,088,150 bp to 15,121,079 bp. The amplimer sets were filtered for the select subset encompassing dmrt1 and cyp21a2 exons, flanking intronic regions, and upstream sequence including the promoters. A BLAST-based algorithm in primer design specified unique amplification within the Zv8 assembly. One male and one female fish of the cross (each homozygous for the respective alternative alleles) were evaluated for variant detection by resequencing. Primer sequences are available from the authors upon request. The identified variants have been submitted to dbSNP (ss184963416-ss189156666 (dmrt1), and ss255538733-ss255540354 (cyp21a2), discontinuous).To facilitate genetic mapping of sex determination in zebrafish, we first created an SNP-based framework genetic map. We identified 1,174,978 candidate diallelic SNPs in 10,437 finished clones sequenced by Sanger, roughly one per kilobase of clone sequence. This resource roughly doubled the number of SNPs that we had previously identified (Bradley et al. 2007). We selected six candidate variants distributed across each of 875 clones to position the clones within a genetic map. We genotyped the candidate SNPs of the clones in an F2 intercross of 1040 meioses (the original 1996 MGH cross) (Knapik et al. 1996; Knapik et al. 1998; Shimoda et al. 1999). Of SNPs successfully assayed, 82% (3966) validated as polymorphic in the cross or in common laboratory strains (AB, IN, TU, TL, WIK, C32, SJD). The specific grandparental chromosomes of the cross were distinguished by 22% of the SNPs. These anchored a subset of 540 of the 875 clones on the genetic map, often redundantly with multiple informative SNPs per clone, totaling 618 unique loci (Figure 1 and supporting information, Table S1). The 1040 meioses of the cross provided a resolution of 0.1 cM. The mean density of the framework SNP map was 3.4 cM and the largest gap was 26.2 cM. An additional 2005 SNPs (polymorphic in the strains, but not informative in the cross) were located within the clones positioned on the framework genetic map. Thus the general resource for positional cloning in zebrafish is comprised of 2875 positioned SNPs (Table S2). An optimally informative zebrafish SNP genetic mapping panel and evaluation of the genetic ancestry of common laboratory strains are described in Figure S1, Figure S2, and Table S3.Unified SNP and STR genetic map of the zebrafish. The SNP map is comprised of 870 SNPs at 618 unique loci (blue tick marks) with a mean locus density of 3.4 Kosambi cM and resolution of 0.01 cM. The SNP genotype data were merged with data of 1989 STRs (red tick marks) of the MGH genetic map for creation of a combined map. The merged map is comprised of 1103 unique loci with a mean locus density of 2.0 Kosambi cM. Further detail of map markers and positions is provided in Table S1.The 44 zebrafish employed for creation of the MGH microsatellite (simple tandem repeat, STR) genetic map were a subset of the 520 employed to create the framework SNP genetic map (Knapik et al. 1998; Shimoda et al. 1999). This allowed us to subsequently distribute markers of the original MGH map into the higher-resolution SNP map. A total of 241 STRs were positioned at loci that were uniquely identified, and a total of 1748 STRs were positioned at loci that were each redundantly identified (e.g., two STRs with the exact same series of genotypes across the 44 F2 progeny identify the same locus). All STR loci were supported by LOD scores ≥7. This strategy conservatively omitted markers with lesser statistical support in map construction. We observed no discordance of STR marker chromosomal assignment or order between this merged map and that of the original MGH map. The merged SNP-STR map has a mean genetic locus density of 2.0 cM, and largest gap of 16.0 cM (Figure 1 and Table S1).We evaluated recombination rate across the zebrafish genome based upon this map, presented in Figure 2. We observed a mean recombination rate of 1.60 cM/Mb for the zebrafish genome. By comparison, the mean sex-averaged recombination rate is 1.13 cM/Mb for human, and 0.63 cM/Mb for the mouse (Kong et al. 2002; Shifman et al. 2006). A high rate of recombination at all distal chromosomal arms is especially pronounced in zebrafish. Telomeric recombination rates reach roughly 2.5 cM/Mb in mouse, while rates often exceed 4 cM/Mb in zebrafish. Distal telomeric recombination suppression is also visible for many chromosomal arms.Recombination rate across the zebrafish genome.A comparison of the genetic map to the Zv9 physical map revealed that few markers were assigned to different chromosomes (1.4% of SNPs and STRs, 0.6% of SNPs, 1.0% of clones). We calculated LOD scores comparing the location of each of these markers in the assigned genetic chromosome to any location on the assigned physical chromosome. Genetic map position support LODs ranged from 12 to 228, while the physical map position support LODs ranged from 0 to 0.1.Other markers were positioned with a different relative order within a given chromosome of the genetic and Zv9 physical maps (7.2% of SNPs and STRs, 3.6% of SNPs, 5.8% of clones). We calculated LOD scores for each chromosome, comparing the marker order in the physical and genetic maps. These LOD scores ranged from −0.03 to −319 (supporting genetic map order). Seventeen percent of the clones genetically positioned by SNPs were oriented by virtue of informative intra-clone recombination events in the cross; 13% of these had relative inverse orientations within the genetic and physical maps. Table S1 provides both genetic and physical map positions of each marker. Alternative explanations for the subset of discordantly positioned markers include error in either map, or large-scale structural polymorphism among different zebrafish populations. Structural polymorphism within the repetitive genome could confound physical assembly based upon clones of many individuals of a population, and could also fail to be evident within a genetic map based upon a single cross.The mapping cross provided substantial power to identify loci controlling sex determination in zebrafish. Of the 520 F2 sibling progeny, 219 were female and 248 were male (53 were of unknown sex). LOD scores for linkage to sex-determination identified two loci that exceeded genome-wide significance for linkage to sex (Figure 3), with nearly identical results for SNP or merged SNP-STR data. One locus resided on chromosome 5 at 53.8 cM with an LOD of 7.9 [near ss48808156 at 53.3 cM, 1.5 LOD drop interval ss48660708 (49.1 cM) to ss48502349 (61.1 cM)]. The other resided on chromosome 16 at 32.0 cM with a LOD of 9.3 [near ss48940970 at 30.4 cM, 1.5 LOD drop interval ss192546947 (28.9 cM) to ss48768171 (35.0 cM)]. More minor peaks are visible on chromosomes 6 and 25 (near ss192942334 and ss48734451, respectively), but neither reached statistical significance. Although these LOD scores were notably large, the LOD score anticipated in this cross if there were a single fully penetrant sex determination gene would have been ∼140. This contrast to the observed LODs highlights the complexity of sex determination in zebrafish. The loci on chromosomes 5 and 16 each explain a fraction of trait variance (7% and 9%, respectively). There was no evidence for an epistatic interaction between the two loci; together they are estimated to account for 16% of the trait variance. Alleles of the chromosome 5 locus appear to act in a recessive male (or alternatively, dominant female) fashion. Each allele of the chromosome 16 locus appears to act additively (one allele male, the other female). Figure 4 illustrates progeny sex relative to genotype combinations at these loci in the cross. All progeny (100%) that inherited fully male allele doses of these two loci were male; 77% of progeny that inherited fully female allele doses of these two loci were female (see also Table S4).Multipoint interval mapping of sex determination in zebrafish. LOD score results are plotted as a function of marker location in cM, with chromosomal number designated at the bottom of the plot. Dashed horizontal lines indicate significance thresholds (α) determined by permutation testing.Plot of the proportion of male progeny of the cross as a function of the alleles at the two major sex-determining loci in zebrafish. The B allele of chromosome 5 (originating from the IN strain male grandparent) corresponds to the male-associated allele of dmrt1, here marked by ss48808156 (T variant of the A/T SNP) in the cross. The A allele of chromosome 16 (originating from the AB strain female grandparent) corresponds to the male-associated allele of cyp21a2, here marked by ss48940970 (T variant of the T/C SNP) in the cross. The 95% confidence intervals of the proportion of males among zebrafish with a given two-locus genotype are illustrated for each data point.The closest flanking markers of the chromosome 5 sex-determining locus (ss48697105 and ss48960192) define a 1.7-cM interval corresponding to 2.2 Mb (Zv9 chromosome 5: 44,453,011 to 46,626,084 bp). Although many genes reside within this interval, one in particular was a candidate of immediate relevance: dmrt1. dmrt1 is the zebrafish ortholog of the doublesex gene, a bifunctional gene regulating both male and female sexual differentiation of the fruit fly. dmrt1 orthologs are the sex-determining genes of the Y chromosome of medaka and of the Z chromosome of birds (Matsuda et al. 2002; Smith et al. 2009). In humans, DMRT1 operates downstream of SRY in sex determination; haploinsufficiency of DMRT1 at 9p24.3 in humans results in sex-reversal of XY individuals (analogous to the recessive male model that we observed in zebrafish) (Muroya et al. 2000). Further, dmrt1 expression is governed by environmental temperature in some species with TSD (Shoemaker et al. 2007).In order to identify a dmrt1 allele that might guide sex determination in zebrafish, we resequenced the male- and female-associated alleles of dmrt1 within the cross. They were distinguished by a total of 162 SNPs, 28 indels, and two simple tandem repeats. We recognized two of these as functional candidates: the nonsynonymous D259E [ss184964113 at Zv9 chromosome 5: 46,608,201 bp, not in a highly conserved region of the protein (NP_991191)], and the central nucleotide of the cis-regulatory motif of the 3′ UTR (ss184964140 at Zv9 chromosome 5: 46,608,515 bp). The evolutionarily conserved 3′ UTR protein-binding motif has been shown to be responsible for dmrt1 transcript stability and translational efficiency, restricted to male gonad and germ cell development (Guo et al. 2005; Herpin et al. 2009). Mutagenesis data that defined the motif predicts that the female-associated allele, 5′-CUGCUACAGAU-3′, would yield lower dmrt1 expression relative to the male allele 5′-CUGCUGCAGAU-3′ in the developing gonadal primordium. Given the striking conservation of the role of dmrt1 in sex determination across evolutionary time, and linkage and mutation detection evidence, dmrt1 is a particularly good candidate of the chromosome 5 locus of the zebrafish cross.The closest flanking markers of the chromosome 16 sex-determining locus, ss48940970 and ss192790632, define a 3.5 cM interval corresponding to 4 Mb (Zv9 chromosome 16: 12,952,287 to 16,952,809 bp). Although many genes reside within the chromosome 16 locus, we recognized one in particular that is salient to the trait. The cyp21a2 (LOC793249) gene is 1.7 Mb from ss192790632. Mutations of the human ortholog of cyp21a2 cause an inborn error of sex development (pseudohermaphroditism). cyp21a2 encodes 21-hydroxylase, biosynthesizing corticosteroids. Cortisol exposure, as well as high temperature, can induce female-to-male sex inversion of genetically female (XX) medaka (Hayashi et al. 2010) and Japanese flounder (Yamaguchi et al. 2010). Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of corticosteroid biosynthesis prevents temperature-mediated inversion of genetically female medaka (Hayashi et al. 2010) and Japanese flounder (Yamaguchi et al. 2010) into males. In the protogynous grouper, 21-hydroxylase is activated in the transition of ovarian to testicular tissue during exogenous testosterone-mediated female-to-male sex inversion (Lee et al. 2002). Collective evidence suggested that cyp21a2 activity might guide sex determination of the developing zebrafish embryo.We resequenced the male- and female-associated alleles of cyp21a2 within the cross seeking variants that might influence 21-hydroxylase activity. The male- and female-associated cyp21a2 alleles were distinguished by a total of 176 SNPs and 24 indels. Potential copy number variation of the cyp21a2 gene (as can occur in humans) did not appear to confound variant discovery. Fish homozygous for the male or for the female alleles of the cross were homozygous at (and distinguished by) each of the discovered genetic variants. The female and male alleles differed at four amino acid positions conserved among orthologs of additional teleost fish (Figure S3). The male allele corresponded to the conserved residue at each of the four positions (male/XP_001919231 residue position/female: G141R (ss255539489 and ss255539495), V375M (ss255540264), Y380H (ss255540270), and V527A (ss255540330, Zv9 chromosome 16: 18,639,369 bp), suggesting that the female allele may have reduced function. V527 was additionally invariant across the mouse and human orthologs. These results are consistent with a potential role of relative 21-hydroxylase activity in ovarian or testicular fate specification in the zebrafish cross.In conclusion, we developed an accurate SNP genetic map of the zebrafish and applied it to identify a genetic component of sex determination. Our linkage results demonstrate that sex determination is a complex trait in zebrafish, not employing sex chromosomes. A number of candidate genes have previously been investigated with a role in sex differentiation in zebrafish, including: dnd (Zv9 chr 14), fancl (chr 13), cyp19a1a and b (chr 18 and 25), ff1a - d (chr 22, 8, 3, and 21), foxL2 (chr 15), sox9a and b (chr 12 and 3), wt1a and b (chr 25 and 18), and amh (chr 22) (Jorgensen et al. 2008; Kuo et al. 2005; Onichtchouk et al. 2003; Rodriguez-Mari et al. 2010; Rodriguez-Mari et al. 2005; Schulz et al. 2007; Siegfried and Nusslein-Volhard 2008; Trant et al. 2001; Uchida et al. 2004; Von Hofsten and Olsson 2005; Weidinger et al. 2003). Alleles at these loci did not statistically significantly contribute to sex determination within the cross. Instead, we identified two other loci on chromosomes 5 and 16 that statistically significantly contributed to sex determination.Zebrafish dmrt1 resides within the chromosome 5 locus; orthologs of this gene play key roles in sex determination of D. melanogaster, C. elegans, medaka fish, birds, and humans. A variant within the dmrt1 3′UTR regulatory element distinguished the male- and female-associated alleles of the zebrafish cross. Zebrafish cyp21a2 resides within the chromosome 16 locus. Current evidence among several fish species supports a key role for steroid hormones, both sex steroids and corticosteroids, in sex determination. Reduced 21-hydroxylase activity results in reduced corticosteroid biosynthesis, potentially resulting in a shunt of precursors toward sex steroid biosynthesis. Mendelian mutations of the human CYP21A2 ortholog are a cause of virilization of males and of females (pseudohermaphroditism). Mutations of human CYP21A2 result in androgen excess, the most common cause of ambiguous external genitalia in the newborn. However, the predicted hypomorphic zebrafish allele (concurrent change of four evolutionarily-conserved amino acids) is that of the female, rather than the male. Prior experiments demonstrating a role for corticosteroids in male development of both medaka and flounder are consistent with a male-associated zebrafish allele of preserved 21-hydroxylase activity, and female-associated zebrafish allele of reduced activity. Corticosteroid-mediated transcriptional suppression of genes that are active in female fish development, such as fshr (Hayashi et al. 2010), might underlie the apparent paradox between the human and the fish systems of sex determination. Alternatively, testosterone excess (resulting from reduced CYP21A2 activity) as a precursor may be converted to estradiol by aromatase, rather than to active dihydrotestosterone by steroid 5-alpha reductase. It is conceivable that the former pathway may predominate in zebrafish. Note that 17-alpha methyltestosterone treatment of embryonic zebrafish skews to male development (Westerfield 1994), but the synthetic androgen is also an aromatase inhibitor (Fenske and Segner 2004).Because the two loci each contribute a relatively small proportion of the variability of this trait, experimental demonstration of causality of the identified alleles may be difficult due to expected incomplete effects on biological sex determination. Based upon current knowledge, complete abrogation of function of each candidate gene may have marked effects on sex determination. However, that would not conclusively establish the identified alleles of either gene as the source of the linkage signal within the cross. Another experimental limitation is posed by the observed complex nature of this trait. Traditional interval mapping is suitable for positional cloning of Mendelian mutations, but would not be fruitful here because a given fish with a recombination event that might narrow a critical interval may, due to incomplete penetrance, be of either sex. Lack of one-to-one correlation between the trait and either locus would confound such an effort. Given current evidence, both dmrt1 and cyp21a2 are very good candidates as genes potentially underlying the linkage signal of the cross, and further work is warranted to evaluate biological causality. Within the AB and IN strains, as well as other zebrafish populations, additional alleles of these and other genes may be found that collectively account for a greater extent of the variability of this complex trait. The SNP mapping panel derived from our work may be useful in further investigation of additional crosses. Additional complex genetic factors and environmental cues are likely to interact in zebrafish sex determination, and remain to be elucidated.We thank Dr. Wolfgang Driever for provision of cross DNA samples.

Here we report a zebrafish brca2 insertional mutant that shares phenotypes with human patients and identifies a novel brca2 function in oogenesis. Experiments showed that mutant embryos and mutant cells in culture experienced genome instability, as do cells in FA patients. In wild-type zebrafish, meiotic cells expressed brca2; and, unexpectedly, transcripts in oocytes localized asymmetrically to the animal pole. In juvenile brca2 mutants, oocytes failed to progress through meiosis, leading to female-to-male sex reversal. Adult mutants became sterile males due to the meiotic arrest of spermatocytes, which then died by apoptosis, followed by neoplastic proliferation of gonad somatic cells that was similar to neoplasia observed in ageing dead end (dnd)-knockdown males, which lack germ cells. The construction of animals doubly mutant for brca2 and the apoptotic gene tp53 (p53) rescued brca2-dependent sex reversal. Double mutants developed oocytes and became sterile females that produced only aberrant embryos and showed elevated risk for invasive ovarian tumors. Oocytes in double-mutant females showed normal localization of brca2 and pou5f1 transcripts to the animal pole and vasa transcripts to the vegetal pole, but had a polarized rather than symmetrical nucleus with the distribution of nucleoli and chromosomes to opposite nuclear poles; this result revealed a novel role for Brca2 in establishing or maintaining oocyte nuclear architecture. Mutating tp53 did not rescue the infertility phenotype in brca2 mutant males, suggesting that brca2 plays an essential role in zebrafish spermatogenesis. Overall, this work verified zebrafish as a model for the role of Brca2 in human disease and uncovered a novel function of Brca2 in vertebrate oocyte nuclear architecture.Women with one strong BRCA2(FANCD1) mutation have high risks of breast and ovarian cancer. People with two mild BRCA2(FANCD1) mutations develop Fanconi Anemia, which reduces DNA repair leading to genome instability, small gonads, infertility, and cancer. Humans and mice lacking BRCA2 activity die before birth. We discovered that zebrafish brca2 mutants show chromosome instability and small gonads, and they develop only as sterile adult males. Female-to-male sex reversal is due to oocyte death during sex determination. Normal animals expressed brca2 in developing eggs and sperm that are repairing DNA breaks associated with genetic reshuffling. Normal developing eggs localized brca2 RNA near the nucleus, suggesting a role in protecting rapidly dividing early embryonic cells. Sperm-forming cells died in adult mutant males. Inhibition of cell death rescued sex reversal, but not fertility. Rescued females developed invasive ovarian tumors and formed eggs with abnormal nuclear architecture. The novel role of Brca2 in organizing the vertebrate egg nucleus may provide new insights into the origin of ovarian cancer. These results validate zebrafish as a model for human BRCA2-related diseases and provide a tool for the identification of substances that can rescue zebrafish brca2 mutants and thus become candidates for therapeutic molecules for human disease.Citation: Rodríguez-Marí A, Wilson C, Titus TA, Cañestro C, BreMiller RA, Yan Y-L, et al.

Breast cancer risk for females heterozygous for germline mutations in BRCA2 is nearly 60% by age 50 [4] and for ovarian cancer is 11% [5]. BRCA2 is expressed in a broad range of mammalian tissues [6], [7] and null activity alleles are embryonic lethal in mouse and humans but are viable in rats [8]-[11]. Biallelic inheritance of hypomorphic BRCA2 mutations in the germline results in Fanconi anemia (FA), a disease characterized by catastrophic anemia, genome instability, characteristic morphological defects, and enormously elevated risk for leukemia (800 fold) and squamous cell carcinomas (2000 fold) [12]-[14]. The BRCA2 subtype of Fanconi anemia represents complementation group D1 [15] and results in a severe form of the disease with nearly 100% incidence of leukemia and/or solid tumors by 5 years of age [16], [17]. The role of BRCA2 in tumor suppression and maintenance of genomic integrity is associated with its function in error-free, homology-directed recombination (HDR) [18]. HDR helps repair DNA breaks associated with meiosis, and mouse mutants in FA genes have defects in meiotic cells [19]. Zebrafish fancl mutants experience female-to-male sex reversal due to the apoptotic loss of meiotic oocytes at the time of sex determination [20], consistent with the abnormal activation of the apoptotic pathway in the absence of Fanconi gene activity [21].The involvement of BRCA2 in HDR, ovarian cancer, hypogonadal phenotypes, and the expression of Brca2 in mouse spermatocytes [22] converge to suggest a role for Brca2 in gonadogenesis. Homozygous Brca2 knockout mice die as embryos [23], but transgenic mice carrying a BRCA2-containing human BAC that expresses the human gene at high levels everywhere except the gonads survive as sterile males and females [24]. In contrast, rats bearing a premature stop codon survive, but show slow growth and sterility [10], reflecting conserved and lineage-specific roles of brca2.To help understand the roles of Brca2 in vertebrates, we characterized zebrafish bearing an insertional mutation in brca2. We show here that comparative analysis of zebrafish brca2 [25] identifies a few conserved, and hence putatively functional, coding regions and is expressed in proliferating somatic cells and in meiotic oocytes and spermatocytes. Surprisingly, brca2 transcript is asymmetrically localized to the animal pole of the cytoplasm in developing wild-type oocytes. The insertional brca2 null activity allele causes genome instability, slow growth of tissue culture cells, male sterility, testicular neoplasias, and female-to-male sex reversal that is rescued by mutation of the tumor suppressor gene tp53(p53). Male and female double mutants are sterile and develop testicular neoplasias and invasive ovarian tumors. Nuclear symmetries are strikingly altered in oocytes of double mutant females, revealing a novel role of Brca2 in establishing or maintaining the architecture of the vertebrate oocyte nucleus. This work reveals that this zebrafish brca2 mutant is a model for unraveling gene functions as well as a valuable tool for small-molecule screens to help discover therapeutic compounds for human patients.We isolated, cloned, and sequenced a zebrafish brca2 cDNA (NM_001110394) and a BAC clone (AC149226). Because the zebrafish Brca2 protein shares only 21% identity with human BRCA2, we confirmed orthology by conserved syntenies [26]. Our meiotic mapping on the HS panel [27] showed that brca2 lies on zebrafish chromosome 15 (Dre15, Figure 1A top), and sequence data at Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org/Danio_rerio/Info/Index) showed that its genomic neighborhood contains 14 genes with conserved synteny to the orthologous region on human chromosome 13 (Hsa13, Figure 1A middle), as would be expected if zebrafish brca2 and human BRCA2 are orthologs. The absence of a second copy of brca2 in the co-orthologous region in Dre10 (Figure 1A bottom) provides evidence that, like all 13 other zebrafish fanc genes [25], [28], brca2 evolved to single copy in the zebrafish lineage after the teleost genome duplication [27], [29]-[31].(A) Syntenies conserved between human and zebrafish brca2 chromosomes were examined using the Synteny database [26]. Synteny analysis shows that the portion of zebrafish linkage group 15 (Dre15) that contains brca2 (arrow, top row) possesses many genes that are orthologous to, and in the same order as, genes in the portion of human chromosome 13 (Hsa13) that contains BRCA2 (arrow, middle row). A portion of Dre10 is co-orthologous to the portion of Hsa13 that contains BRCA2 but has no brca2 gene (lower row). Genes represented above the line are transcribed to the right and those below to the left. Gene names are from Ensembl. Lines connect orthologs (dark gray). (B) Exons (black bars) in zebrafish brca2 are similar in size to orthologous exons in human BRCA2, including the large exon-10 and the enormous exon-11. Introns not drawn to scale. (C) Zebrafish Brca2 protein shares domain structure with the human protein. Amino acid positions are listed below. (D) BRCA2 proteins were aligned and phylogenetic trees were inferred using ClustalW [90] and diagrammed with NJPlot [91]. Phylogenetic analysis of human, chicken, and zebrafish BRC repeats shows that individual BRCs are mostly not orthologous. A strongly supported clade grouped BRCy with zebrafish BRC 6 and 8, as expected if they arose by tandem duplication or experienced gene conversion. Numbers at nodes are bootstrap values for 1000 runs. (E) Comparison of amino acid hydrophobicities of aligned BRC repeats used the Kyte–Doolittle method [92]. Correlation of hydrophobicity indices among zebrafish BRC repeats shows that the physical properties of BRC repeats have been maintained despite residue evolution.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001357.g001A comparison of our cDNA and BAC sequences revealed that zebrafish brca2 has 26 exons (numbered 2–27 to follow human nomenclature; Figure 1B) like its tetrapod ortholog [7], [32]-[34]. Despite low sequence identity (21%), zebrafish Brca2 conserves an N-terminal acidic transcriptional activation domain and a C-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD) [35]-[37] (Figure 1C). Exon-11, with 1,397 amino acid residues in zebrafish and 1,643 residues in human, is one of the longest vertebrate exons, 28 times larger than average [38]. Use of the stickleback brca2 sequence (Figure S1) to help inform alignments showed that exon-11 of zebrafish brca2 contains a central array of BRC repeats conserved in approximate number, relative position, and sequence identity to those in tetrapods [34] (Figure S2A). Phylogenetic analysis of BRC repeats revealed orthology between chicken and human repeats 1, 5, 7, and 8 (Figure 1D) but not a one-to-one orthology between zebrafish and tetrapod repeats, suggesting that some individual repeats may have evolved independently by tandem duplication and/or gene conversion. Despite differences in BRC repeat sequences, the correlation of hydrophobicity indexes among repeats revealed great structural similarity (Figure 1E). The DBDs of zebrafish and human Brca2 contain three oligonucleotide binding folds (OB1-3) and a helical domain (HD) [37] (Figure 1C and Figure S3). The mapping of human tumor-derived mutations to these conserved features [37] supports the hypothesis that they are critical for functionally similar molecular interactions across vertebrates.In zebrafish embryos, brca2 has been shown to be expressed maternally and zygotically [25], and this is confirmed here by RT-PCR (Figure S4A) and histological sections that show broad expression that is elevated in rapidly proliferating cells in the embryonic and larval central nervous system, in the proliferating ventricle margins of adult brains, in the blood-forming kidney marrow, and in the proliferative intervillus region of the intestine [39] (Figure S4B-S4N). Germ line cells expressed brca2 in both male and female gonads in transitional stages (Figure 2A, 2B), in immature gonads (Figure 2C, 2D), and in the mature gonads of adults (Figure 2E, 2F). Somatic cells of the zebrafish gonad either do not express brca2, or do so at a low level like mouse Sertoli cells [40].(A,B) 26dpf transitioning stage ovaries and testes, respectively, express brca2 in the ooplasm of oocytes (arrow) and in male germ cells. (C,D) Expression of brca2 increases in 33dpf immature ovaries and testis, respectively. Arrows indicate examples of brca2-expressing cells. (E) In wild-type ovaries, brca2 transcript is highly expressed in the ooplasm of late stage IB oocytes (L-IB, arrow) and gradually becomes localized to a small portion of the ooplasm in stage III and IV oocytes (arrowheads). (F) Spermatocytes contain brca2 transcript but spermatids and sperm do not. (G) Stage III-IV oocytes accumulate brca2 transcript in a pole of the oocyte. (H) Comparison to the adjacent section probed for the animal pole marker pou5f1(oct4) reveals that brca2 transcript localizes to the animal pole in the same location as pou5f1(oct4) message (arrows in G and H). Abbreviations: II, III, IV, stages of oocyte development; L-IB, late stage IB oocyte (stages according to [49]); do, degenerating oocyte; GV, germinal vesicle; sc, spermatocyte; sp, sperm.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001357.g002Unexpectedly, in stage III and IV oocytes, brca2 transcripts became asymmetrically distributed to a small peripheral patch of the ooplasm (Figure 2E). Comparison with the distribution of pou5f1(oct4) [41], [42] revealed that brca2 mRNA transcripts accumulated asymmetrically at the animal pole of the oocyte (Figure 2G, 2H). Expression of brca2 was obvious in spermatocytes (sc, Figure 2F), but not in spermatids and sperm (sp, Figure 2F), as in mouse [40]. Expression of brca2 in meiotic cells is consistent with a role in repairing DNA breaks associated with meiotic HDR. Furthermore, the accumulation of brca2 transcript at the animal pole suggests a role of maternal message in provisioning embryos with Brca2 protein that could help effect DNA repair during the rapid cleavage divisions that occur before the initiation of zygotic transcription at the mid-blastula transition.To understand brca2 function, we studied a zebrafish line with the insertional mutation ZM_00057434, which disrupts brca2 exon-11 in BRC repeat-z (Figure 1C, Figure 3A and 3B, Figure S2). Reverse transcriptase-PCR and sequence analysis detected no normal transcript in mutants, but instead identified two aberrant transcripts, one lacking the DBD and the other lacking all BRC repeats (Figure 3C–3G). Because Brca2 protein cannot function without either of these features [37], we conclude that ZM_00057434 is a null allele.(A) The ZM_00057434 insertion disrupts exon-11 of zebrafish brca2 in the last BRC repeat. (B) The insertion (arrow) disrupts the wild-type (WT) sequence, leading to a mutant (MUT) sequence that contains five substituted amino acid residues encoded by the insert followed by a stop codon (*) that truncates the protein before the DNA binding domain, which is essential for Brca2 activity. (C) Amplification using primers F1 and R1 (see panel A and Table S1) produced a transcript from wild-type cDNA but none from homozygous mutant cDNA. (D) Amplification using primers F2 and R2 showed that transcripts including exon-18 occur in both wild types and mutants. (E) Amplification using primers F3 and R3 revealed that mutants, but not wild types, made transcripts that lack exon-11. (F) Amplification using primers F4 and R4 showed that mutants, but not wild types, made transcripts that include part of exon-11 and the insert. (G) The transcript amplified in panel F is predicted to make a transcript that lacks exon-11 but continues in-frame and makes a non-functional protein lacking all BRC repeats. (H) Most tissue culture cells established from the caudal fin of wild-type adults had a normal karyotype even after MMC treatment. (I) Most tissue culture cells established from the caudal fin of homozygous brca2 mutant adults showed chromatid breaks after MMC treatments, including acentric fragments, and radial chromosomes (arrows). (J,K) Acridine orange (AO) treatment of wild types and brca2 mutants not treated with DEB revealed about equal levels of cells staining with AO. (L,M) After DEB treatment, the number of AO-positive cells increased a small amount in 28hpf wild-type embryos but increased substantially in 28hpf brca2 mutant embryos. (N) The number of AO-positive cells increased with DEB concentration in all three genotypes tested, but nearly twice as much in brca2 mutant cells. (O-S) Growth, apoptosis and non-apoptotic cell death in cultured zebrafish fibroblasts. (O) Cell cultures established from brca2 mutant caudal fins (brca2, triangles) grew slower than cultures established from wild types (circles), reaching only 33.5% of the control count after 5 days. The additional effect of 15 nM mitomycin C (MMC) on growth retardation was relatively low but more distinct in brca2 mutant cultures than wild-type cultures (open triangles and open circles, respectively). The graph displays the mean and standard deviation of multiples of the seeded cell number from three independent experiments. (P-S) Apoptosis is mainly responsible for the growth deficit of brca2 mutant cells. (P) Untreated brca2 cultures showed spontaneous apoptosis of 15% of cells (upper right quadrant) and 2.9% of cells experienced non-apoptotic death (upper left quadrant). (Q) Exposure to 50 nM mitomycin C for 24 h increased the non-apoptotic cell death rate in brca2 mutant cultures only to 4.8%, whereas the rate of apoptotic cells remained about the same (14.1%). (R) Wild-type cultures revealed just 2% spontaneous apoptosis (upper right quadrant) and 2% non-apoptotic cell death (upper left quadrant). (S) Exposure to 50 nM mitomycin C for 24 h increased the non-apoptotic cell death rate to 3.9% but left the rate of apoptotic cells unchanged (1.6%).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001357.g003Genome instability is a cardinal characteristic of Fanconi anemia [43], [44]. Cell cultures from fins of homozygous brca2 zebrafish mutants and wild-type controls revealed normal karyotypes (2n = 50) with low levels of spontaneous breakage (Figure 3H). After treatment with 10 ng/ml of the DNA-damage agent MMC, however, mutant cells showed many chromosome aberrations, including chromatid and chromosome breaks, radial reunion figures, and acentric chromosome fragments. Of 100 metaphases counted in mutant cells, 66 showed chromosome aberrations, including 32 that showed one or two anomalies, 23 with 3 or 4 abnormal chromosomes, and 11 with more than 5 aberrations (Figure 3I). In contrast, all 24 metaphases from wild-type cells treated with MMC were normal (Figure 3H). These results show that zebrafish cells require brca2 activity to prevent chromosome aberrations.To test genome stability in living animals, we crossed brca2 heterozygotes, stained resulting embryos at 28hpf with acridine orange (AO, which fluoresces strongly when it intercalates into DNA with double-strand breaks [45]), scored the amount of AO staining in individual embryos, and genotyped embryos by PCR. Untreated mutants and wild-type controls had about the same amount of AO staining (Figure 3J, 3K). In contrast, after treatment with the DNA damage agent diepoxybutane (DEB) at 4hpf, mutants accumulated substantially more AO-positive cells than wild-type siblings (Figure 3L-3N). Thus, we conclude that Brca2 helps protect zebrafish embryos from DNA damage.To learn the role of brca2(fancd1) in zebrafish somatic cells, we established tissue cultures from fin biopsies of brca2 mutants and wild types and studied their growth rates. Mutant cultures showed significantly slower growth compared to wild-type cultures (Figure 3O, p<0.001 at day 5). Addition of MMC further delayed culture growth both for brca2 mutants (p<0.5 vs. untreated) and for wild types, although delay in wild types was not statistically significant (Figure 3O). The poor growth of brca2 mutant cultures was due to high rates of spontaneous apoptosis (15%, Figure 3P-3S), as evidenced by propidium iodide exclusion and anti-active Caspase-3 staining. In brca2 mutants, addition of MMC increased the non-apoptotic cell death rate from 2.9% to 4.8% while the proportion of apoptotic cells remained essentially the same (15.0 and 14.1%, respectively, Figure 3P, 3Q). Untreated wild-type cultures revealed much less spontaneous apoptosis than mutant cultures (2% vs. 15%; Figure 3R) and showed just a small effect of MMC on the non-apoptotic cell death rate (2.0% untreated, 3.9% treated, Figure 3S). We conclude that mutant cultures grow more slowly than wild-type cultures due to high rates of spontaneous apoptosis.To test the viability of zebrafish brca2 mutants, we mated heterozygotes, and among 414 adult offspring, 24.9% were homozygous wild types, 44.9% were heterozygotes, and 30.2% were homozygous mutants, a ratio indistinguishable from the expected 1:2:1 ratio (X2 test, p = 0.37, df = 2). We conclude that zebrafish brca2 mutants survive about as well as wild types, as in Drosophila [46]. In addition, zebrafish brca2(fancd1) mutants expressed genes for primitive and definitive hematopoiesis normally (Figure S5), providing no evidence for the early hematopoietic defects found in human FA patients.Remarkably, however, all homozygous brca2 mutants developed exclusively as males. A series of heterozygote in-crosses gave 199 wild-type homozygotes and heterozygotes, about half of which were females (50.2%±0.1% (sd)). In contrast, of the 61 homozygous mutants, none were female (X2 test, p = 0.00003, df = 2). Genotypic ratios following Mendelian principles ruled out female-specific lethality; thus, we conclude that individuals that would otherwise have become females experienced female-to-male sex reversal. Homozygous brca2 mutant males were sterile (the 35 males tested fertilized no eggs, with an average clutch size of 197 eggs tested per male), but wild-type sibling males were all fertile (the 28 males tested fertilized an average of 80% of the eggs per male with an average clutch size of 210 eggs tested per male). These data show that brca2 plays a role in male fertility and is necessary for female development in otherwise wild-type fish.To investigate the developmental basis of sex reversal in brca2 mutants, we analyzed transitional and immature (but differentiated) gonads. All juvenile zebrafish, regardless their definitive sex, initially develop oocytes; in females, these oocytes continue to develop but in males, they disappear [47], [48]. In our experiments, some wild types at 21dpf contained perinucleolar oocytes (early stage IB) and other wild types contained a few pyknotic cells and oocytes at earlier stages of development (early oocytes at stage IA (leptotene to pachytene) [49]) (Figure 4A, 4B). In contrast, all eight homozygous brca2 mutants examined at 21dpf lacked perinucleolar oocytes and contained earlier stage oocytes and large numbers of pyknotic cells (Figure 4C). By 27dpf, wild types contained either ovaries or testes (Figure 4D, 4E). All eight brca2 mutants analyzed, however, showed testis-like gonads that lacked perinucleolar oocytes but retained a few early oocytes and pyknotic cells (Figure 4F). At 32dpf, perinucleolar oocytes in wild-type animals reached late stage IB and entered diplotene, as indicated by the presence of lampbrush chromosomes (Figure 4G), while testes of wild-type males showed all stages of spermatogenesis including sperm (Figure 4H). In contrast, all eight brca2 mutants analyzed at 32dpf had only testes that possessed spermatogonia (sg) and spermatocytes (sc) but lacked later developmental stages (spermatids and sperm) (Figure 4I). In addition, 32dpf mutant gonads showed abnormal clusters of cells with pyknotic nuclei (pc, outlined by dashed lines in Figure 4I) and contained tubules abnormally depleted of germ cells (asterisk, Figure 4I).In transitioning gonads of wild types at 21dpf, ovary-like gonads (A) contained perinucleolar oocytes (early stage IB), while testis-like gonads (B) contained gonia, some early oocytes, and a few pyknotic cells. (C) Gonads of 21dpf brca2 mutants contained a few early oocytes and many pyknotic cells. (D) By 27dpf, perinucleolar oocytes had enlarged in wild-type ovaries. (E) Wild-type 27dpf testes possessed gonia. (F) 27dpf brca2 mutant gonads contained gonia, some early oocytes (judging from cell size and the location and number of nucleoli), showed testis-like morphology, and had many pyknotic cells. (G) At 32dpf, wild-type immature ovaries contained growing perinucleolar oocytes that had reached diplotene stage (late stage IB). (H) Wild-type 32dpf testes showed germ cells at all stages of spermatogenesis: spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids, and sperm. (I) Homozygous brca2 mutant gonads at 32dpf possessed spermatogonia and spermatocytes, and tubules filled with pyknotic cells (dashed area) but lacked spermatids and sperm and had instead empty tubules (*). In transitioning gonads at 21–27dpf, we use the term ‘gonia’ (g) to represent cells that show the histological characteristics of spermatogonia (central nucleolus) and in differentiating testes at 32 dpf, we used the term ‘spermatogonia’ (sg) to represent such cells (Figure 4H′, 4I′). (J) Anti-active-Caspase-3 staining did not label cells in immature 60dpf wild-type testes. (K) In contrast, anti-active-Caspase-3 stained cohorts of cells in immature 60dpf mutant testes. (L,M) Staining the same sections with hematoxylin and eosin showed that cells staining for anti-active-Caspase-3 were pyknotic (arrows). Oocyte staging according to [49].

In addition, results showed that brca2 mutant germ cells became pyknotic, disappeared, and left empty spermatogenic tubules.The presence of pyknotic spermatocytes, lack of spermatids and sperm, and the existence of empty tubules in brca2 mutant testes suggested the hypothesis that spermatocytes did not progress through meiosis and died. To test if the activation of apoptotic pathways is involved in spermatocyte death, we used immunoassays to detect active-Caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis [50]. In contrast to wild-type gonads, brca2 mutant testes showed clusters of cells with active-Caspase-3 that were clearly pyknotic after hematoxylin and eosin staining (Figure 4J–4M), confirming that brca2 spermatocytes undergo apoptosis.At 47dpf, brca2(fancd1) mutants already showed hypogonadism (Figure S6I), a characteristic shared by many FA patients. Germ cell distribution as revealed by vasa expression [51] was similar in mutants and wild-type gonads (Figure S6A, S6E, S6I). In mutants, somatic cells expressing the Sertoli cell marker amh (anti-Müllerian hormone) [52], [53] failed to form neat borders surrounding tubules as in wild-type males (Figure S6F,S6J) and lacked expression of the female marker cyp19a1a (aromatase) [54] (Figure S6C, S6G, S6K). The early meiotic marker sycp3 (synaptonemal complex protein 3, [55]) was expressed by groups of spermatocytes in wild-type and mutant males (Figure S6H, S6L). We conclude that mutant gonads develop a molecular profile similar to wild-type testis accompanied by disorganization of amh-expressing somatic cells that surround testis tubules.To understand the cellular basis of male infertility in brca2 mutants, we compared adult testis histology in wild types (n = 3) and brca2 mutants (n = 7). Comparison of the anterior part of the testes (anterior testes) of wild types and brca2 mutants revealed persistent hypogonadism (smaller diameter gonads) in the mutants (Figure 5A, 5B). Strikingly, brca2 mutant testes lacked sperm and showed tubules with central empty cavities (asterisks). Wild-type and mutant testes both contained spermatocytes at the bouquet stage (late-zygotene/early-pachytene [56], [57]) (sc-b, Figure 5C, 5D), but mutants lacked later stages (spermatids and sperm). Mutant testes also contained abnormal clusters of pyknotic cells (pc, Figure 5D). Occasionally, bouquet stage spermatocytes and pyknotic cells occupied the same tubule (Figure 5E), suggesting that spermatocytes blocked in meiosis became pyknotic. Eosinophils (eos, Figure 5F) invaded some cavities containing pyknotic cells, suggesting an inflammation-like response in mutant gonads. In the posterior part of the testes (posterior testes) of wild types, tubules demarcated by interstitial cells were filled with sperm (sp, Figure 5G), but in the posterior testes of brca2 mutants, tubules were devoid of sperm (Figure 5H). This observation can account for the infertility phenotype of adult brca2 mutant males.(A) Adult testes of wild types were organized into tubules that contained sperm (sp). (B) Adult testes of brca2 mutants were smaller in diameter and lacked sperm, but instead contained clusters of pyknotic cells and empty tubules (asterisks). (C) The anterior part of the testes (anterior testes) in wild-type adults possessed all stages of spermatogenesis: spermatogonia, spermatocytes at the bouquet stage (late zygotene-early pachytene) of meiosis, as well as later stages -- spermatids and sperm. (D,E,F) brca2 mutant anterior testes also had spermatogonia and bouquet stage spermatocytes, but strikingly, contained tubules of pyknotic cells, lacked spermatids and sperm, and had eosinophils that were not observed in wild-type testes. (G) The posterior part of the testes (posterior testes) of wild types contained tubules filled with germ cells at only the latest stage of spermatogenesis: sperm. (H) The posterior testis of brca2 mutants lacked sperm and had empty tubules (*) formed by interstitial cells. (I,J) The posterior testes of brca2 mutants developed neoplasias formed by spermatogonia and interstitial cells, demarcated by dotted lines and shown in enlargements (K,L). Abbreviations: asterisks (*), empty testis tubules; eos: eosinophils; ic: interstitial cells; pc: pyknotic cells; sc-b: spermatocytes at bouquet stage; sd: spermatids; sg: spermatogonia; sp: sperm.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001357.g005In addition to truncated spermatogenesis, brca2 mutant testes displayed abnormal regions of accumulating cells (Figure 5I-5L). Some of these neoplasias contained both spermatogonia (sg) and interstitial cells (ic, Figure 5I, 5K) and others contained only spermatogonia (sg, Figure 5J, 5L). We conclude that brca2 provides some function that regulates proliferation of spermatogonia and interstitial cells.To help understand the altered morphologies of adult mutant testes, we studied gene expression patterns. In the anterior testis, brca2 mutants contained more clusters of vasa-expressing cells than did wild types (Figure 6A, 6A′, 6D, 6D′), reflecting the accumulation of vasa-expressing early germ cell stages (spermatogonia and spermatocytes, Figure 6A′, 6D′)) and the depletion of non-vasa expressing late stages (spermatids and sperm; purple circle, Figure 6A′). In brca2 mutants, amh-expressing cells were less frequent and did not surround tubules normally (Figure 6B, 6E). In addition, sycp3-expressing pachytene spermatocytes accumulated abnormally in mutant testes (Figure 6C, 6F), as expected from the histological data that showed the lack of post-meiotic cells.In situ hybridization on adjacent sections of testes with markers for early germ cells (vasa), Sertoli cells (amh) and germ cells during recombination stages (sycp3) in wild types and brca2 mutants. (A–C) The anterior testis of wild types expressed vasa in early germ cells, amh in Sertoli cells surrounding tubules, and sycp3 in meiotic spermatocytes. (A′) Enlargement illustrates a gradient of vasa expression in spermatocytes: from moderate vasa expression (red circle) to low vasa expression (green circle), and finally spermatids and sperm (purple circle) that did not express vasa. (D) The anterior testis of brca2 mutants showed more tubules with vasa-expressing spermatogonia than wild types (A). (D′) Enlargement shows cells expressing low levels of vasa (red circle) and spermatocytes not expressing vasa (green circle) but no small spermatids or sperm. (E) brca2 mutants showed that amh-expressing cells were poorly organized and did not surround tubules neatly as in wild types, revealing an altered Sertoli cell distribution. (F) brca2 mutants expressed the recombination marker sycp3 in locally larger cell clusters than wild types, revealing an increased local concentration of cells at or entering pachytene stage. (G, H) In the posterior part of the testis, wild types did not express vasa or amh. (I) Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining clearly showed sperm in many tubules in the posterior testes of wild types. (J–O) The posterior testes of brca2 mutants contained many tubules that were devoid of sperm (*) and contained vasa-expressing germ cells and Sertoli cells, which are not normally found in the wild-type posterior testes. (M–O) In one of two mutants analyzed, the posterior testes contained a larger proliferation of vasa-positive spermatogonia and also showed disorganized amh-expressing Sertoli cells, lacked sperm, and had empty tubules. Abbreviations: asterisks (*), empty testis tubules; gc, germ cells; i, intestine; ic, interstitial cells; sg, spermatogonia; sc, spermatocytes; Se, Sertoli cells; sp, sperm.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001357.g006The posterior testes of adult wild types did not express vasa and amh, consistent with the presence of interstitial cells and late germ cells (sperm), which no longer express vasa, and the absence of Sertoli cells (Figure 6G–6I). In contrast, posterior testes of adult mutants contained empty cavities and abnormally proliferating cells (Figure 6J–6O) similar to those observed in histological analyses (Figure 5I–5L). Neoplasias contained either mixtures of vasa-expressing and non-vasa-expressing cells (Figure 6J–6L) or possessed only vasa-expressing, early spermatogenic cells (Figure 6M–6O). These results revealed the abnormal presence of early spermatogenic cells in the posterior part of the testes in mutants. Moreover, the presence of scattered amh-expressing cells revealed the abnormal presence of Sertoli cells in mutant posterior testes (Figure 6K, 6N).All zebrafish gonads initially form oocytes but these die in wild-type juvenile males [47], [48], and increased germ cell apoptosis leads to oocyte loss and female-to-male sex reversal in fancl mutant zebrafish [20]. Tp53 (alias p53) is an important activator of apoptosis and zebrafish with hypomorphic mutations in tp53 are viable and fertile despite reduced apoptosis [58], [59]. To learn the role of apoptosis in sex reversal of brca2 mutants, we made double mutants for brca2 and the hypomorphic allele tp53M214K [58], [59]. Results showed that no brca2−/− mutants with at least one wild-type tp53 allele developed into females (Figure 7A). In contrast, brca2−/− mutants that lacked a normal tp53 allele became males and females with about equal frequency (Figure 7A). This result shows that a tp53 mutation can rescue the female-to-male sex reversal caused by the lack of brca2 activity. Because double mutant females develop ovaries containing oocytes (Figure 7E), we conclude that Tp53-mediated apoptotic cell death is important for sex reversal in brca2 mutants and interpret these results to mean that the survival of oocytes in brca2 mutant gonads can allow individuals to become females. The rescue of sex reversal by Tp53 mutation reveals that brca2 function is required for oocyte survival, which secondarily leads to female gonad fate and ovarian development.(A) Expected (ex) and observed (ob) frequencies of various tp53 genotypes among the homozygous brca2 mutant offspring of parents doubly heterozygous for tp53M214K and brca2 ZM_00075660 alleles. Females developed only in the absence of a wild-type tp53 allele, showing that the tp53 mutation rescued the sex reversal phenotype. (B) Doubly heterozygous embryos from the mating of homozygous tp53 females to males heterozygous for the brca2 mutation develop like normal embryos (B1 and B4 at 6 and 19 hpf, respectively) but the same genotype developing from the mating of rescued brca2;tp53 double mutant females and homozygous wild-type males stopped developing shortly after gastrulation (B2, B3, B5, B6). (C–E) Sections of ovaries from 6mpf wild-type, single mutant tp53, and double mutant brca2;tp53 adults, respectively, showed that oocytes in tp53 mutants developed normally (D′) but that oocytes degenerated and the vitelline envelope was abnormally separated from the granulosa cells in double mutants (E′). Strikingly, oocytes in double mutants showed nuclear anomalies (arrowheads in E). (F–H) Sections of wild-type late stage IB (transitioning to stage II), stage II, and stage III oocytes, respectively, contained radially symmetrical nuclei with small round nucleoli located mostly near the nuclear envelope and thin chromosomes separated from each other in the middle of the nucleus. (I–K) Sections of late stage IB, stage II, and stage III oocytes of brca2;tp53 double mutants showed abnormal nuclear asymmetry. Oocytes contained nuclei with large, variably-shaped nucleoli clustered at one side of the periphery of the nucleus instead of the normal uniform distribution around the periphery of the nucleus and chromosomes clustered at the other side of the nucleus opposite to the nucleoli. (L) Chromosomes in wild types were thin and separated (arrowheads). (M) Chromosomes in oocytes of double mutants were thicker and clumped and formed abnormal crosses and loops (arrowheads). (N,P) Invasive ovarian tumors (asterisks) were detected in sections of two of four brca2;tp53 double mutants by 6mpf but were not present in other genotypes (wild-types and single tp53 mutants). (N) One tumor appeared to originate at the ovarian cavity membrane (arrow) and the other tumor (P) was metastatic and contacted the ovarian cavity membrane and the swim bladder. (N′,Q) Both tumors were formed by spindle-shaped cells (O) that invaded the ovary and surrounded the oocytes. Abbreviations: IB,II,III: oocyte stages; ca, cortical alveoli; ch, chromosomes; d, degenerating oocyte; gc, granulosa cell; nc, nucleoli; oc, ovarian cavity; sb, swim bladder; ve, vitelline envelope.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001357.g007In wild-type late stage II to early stage III oocytes, brca2 and pou5f1 transcripts localize to the animal pole and vasa transcripts gradually spread out cortically from the vegetal pole (Figure 2G, 2H, Figure S7A–S7C, and [41], [42], [60]-[62]). To test the hypothesis that brca2 function is important for the localization of these transcripts, we examined mRNA distribution in oocytes of brca2;tp53 double mutants. In situ hybridization on adjacent serial sections showed that double mutant females produced oocytes with brca2 and pou5f1 transcripts localized to one pole and vasa transcripts positioned at the opposite pole of the same individual oocytes (Figure S7D–S7F). We conclude that brca2 activity is not necessary to localize the messages tested to their proper location in developing zebrafish oocytes.To learn if tp53 mutation can rescue the infertility phenotype observed in brca2 single mutants, we mated brca2 homozygous mutants that were either wild type, heterozygous, or homozygous for the tp53 mutation to wild-type animals and scored fertility. Results showed that all brca2 mutant males were sterile regardless of their tp53 genotype (for brca2−/−;tp53+/+, brca2−/−;tp53+/−, and brca2−/−;tp53−/−: we found 0/200 offspring (8 males tested), 0/349 offspring (13 males tested), and 0/148 offspring (6 males tested), respectively). Female brca2;tp53 double mutants were also sterile when mated to wild-type males (of 549 eggs produced by 9 females, 79 initiated cleavage (the average double mutant female had 20%±18% fertility compared to doubly heterozygous siblings with 85%±27% fertility). Non-developing eggs laid by double mutant females were milky and were of highly variable size. Some double mutant females mated to wild-type males produced doubly heterozygous eggs that completed cleavage and gastrulation, but failed to develop to later stages (Figure 7B). Because doubly heterozygous individuals from doubly heterozygous mothers develop normally but doubly heterozygous embryos from homozygous brca2 mutants are lethal, and because homozygous tp53 mutant females have normal fertility [58], we conclude that maternal brca2 function is important for proper embryo development.Histological sections of 6mpf (months post-fertilization) adult ovaries from wild types (brca2+/+;tp53+/+; n = 3), tp53 homozygous mutants (brca2+/+;tp53−/−; n = 3) and double mutants (brca2−/−;tp53−/−; n = 4) revealed oocytes at a variety of developmental stages in all three genotypes (Figure 7C–7E). In tp53 mutants and in wild types, late stage IB oocytes (L-IB) contained nucleoli distributed uniformly along the nuclear periphery (Figure 7C, 7D, 7D′), consistent with the normal fertility of homozygous tp53M214K mutants [58]. In contrast, brca2;tp53 double mutants contained degenerating late stage oocytes (d, Figure 7E) with a granulosa cell layer (gc) that was poorly organized and sometimes separated from the vitelline envelope (ve, Figure 7E′). Wild-type nuclei of late stage IB to early stage II, stage II, and stage III oocytes were radially symmetrical, containing peripheral nucleoli and central chromosomes (Figure 7F–7H). In contrast, brca2−/−;tp53−/− double mutant oocytes were polarized, showing abnormally enlarged and variably shaped nucleoli that accumulated asymmetrically towards one pole of the nucleus while chromosomes concentrated towards the opposite pole (Figure 7I–7K). We conclude that brca2 activity is essential to establish or to maintain a normal architecture of the oocyte nucleus.In addition to their abnormal location, oocyte chromosomes in double mutants had altered morphology. In wild-type oocytes, chromosomes were distributed independently in the center of the nucleus (arrows in Figure 7L), but chromosomes in oocytes of double mutants were interconnected and formed abnormal loops (arrows in Figure 7M). These chromosome phenotypes were not observed in oocytes of tp53 single mutant females. Aberrant chromosome structure would be expected if recombination-induced chromosome breaks are left unrepaired or are repaired by an error-prone pathway. Our experiments showed that MMC-induced DNA breaks caused chromatid and chromosome damage that led to radial reunion formation in somatic cells (Figure 3I). Likewise, inappropriate repair of recombination-induced DNA breaks could prevent dispersal of oocyte chromosomes. These results suggest a role of brca2 in repairing DNA breaks originating either artificially by MMC or naturally in meiotic recombination.Because humans heterozygous for BRCA2 mutations have elevated risk of tumors, we investigated older brca2:tp53 mutants for abnormal growths. By 6mpf, tumors formed that invaded the ovarian cavity and intercalated between oocytes in two of four brca2−/−;tp53−/− double mutants examined (asterisks, Figure 7N–7Q). Tumors were not detected in wild types (n = 3) or in tp53 homozygous mutants (n = 3). One tumor appeared to originate at the ovarian cavity membrane (arrow, Figure 7N). Tumor origin in the other female was unclear because it was metastatic and contacted both the ovarian cavity membrane and the swim bladder (Figure 7P). Both tumors involved spindle-shaped cells that invaded the ovary and surrounded the oocytes (Figure 7N′, 7O, 7Q). The high incidence of ovarian cancer we observed in brca2−/−;tp53−/− double mutants contrasts with the prior finding that animals homozygous for either of two mutant tp53 alleles (tp53M214K, the mutation used here, or tp53I166T) are viable and fertile, but at 8.5 or 8.8mpf (ten weeks later than our double mutants), 1 of 144 and 1 of 417 fish, respectively, began to show tumors and by 16.5 or 22mpf, 28% or 100%, respectively, of the tp53 mutants had developed tumors [58], [59]. Of several hundred tumors previously described in tp53 mutants, none were reported to involve the ovarian cavity membrane [58], [59]. The early appearance and unique ovarian location of tumors in brca2−/−;tp53−/− double mutants suggest a specific association with brca2 activity, potentiated by impaired tp53 function and Tp53 deficiency is cooperative with Brca2 in tumorigenesis in humans [8]. Future long-term investigations are required that focus on tumor development in a large cohort of brca2−/−;tp53−/− double mutants (1/16th of the progeny of double heterozygotes) compared to their single mutant tp53−/− siblings to more clearly define the role of brca2 in the development of ovarian tumors.Testis development was abnormal in double mutants. Analyses of wild-type (n = 4) and tp53 single mutant (n = 3) testes in 6mpf adults revealed germ cells at all stages of spermatogenesis in all the animals analyzed (Figure 8A, 8B). In contrast, all testes analyzed of brca2−/− single mutants (brca2−/−;tp53+/+; n = 4) and double mutants (brca2−/−;tp53−/−, n  =  6) abnormally lacked spermatids and sperm (Figure 8C, 8D). Furthermore, in all brca2−/−;tp53+/+ single mutants and all brca2−/−;tp53−/− double mutants, posterior tubules contained empty cavities lacking germ cells (asterisks in Figure 8C, 8D) consistent with our finding that adult double mutants failed to recover fertility. Unexpectedly, some testes in brca2−/−;tp53−/− double mutants (n = 2), but not in the other genotypes, contained germ cells enlarged up to ten times normal diameter (Figure 8E). Some of these enormous cells we call megalospermatogonia (ms) because, like normal spermatogonia [63], they contained an enlarged central nucleolus (nc). Testes of some brca2−/−;tp53−/− double mutants (n = 3) contained other large cells that showed the peripheral distribution of numerous nucleoli, which constitutes an oocyte-like morphology [63], so we interpret these as large early oocytes (eo), and additionally we observed the presence of enlarged pyknotic cells (pc) (ms, pc, and eo in Figure 8E, 8F, 8F′, compare to normal spermatogonia (sg) outlined by dashed lines in Figure 8E, 8F). The lack of sex-specific markers for early gonial cells precludes a more precise definition of cell type. Somatic cell neoplasias appeared in the posterior testis of all double mutants (but showing variability on the neoplastic tissue size) (Figure 8G, 8G′) suggesting the hypothesis that late stage spermatogenic cells negatively regulate the proliferation of somatic cells in testes. To test this hypothesis and to investigate whether the absence of brca2 activity or merely the absence of germ cells allows over-proliferation of the somatic component of the testis, we examined animals depleted of germ cells by dead end-morpholino (dnd−/−; n = 10; see also [64]). Dnd is an RNA binding protein that is essential for germ cell survival in mice and zebrafish [64], [65]. Our results revealed that testes in 18mpf dnd-morpholino treated animals developed neoplastic somatic proliferation (Figure 8H, 8H′) similar to those observed in brca2 single and brca2;tp53 double mutants (Figure 5I, 5K, Figure 8G). In five of ten dnd-injected animals, neoplasias invaded the intestine and body wall musculature (Figure 8H). Although we did not detect invasive somatic proliferation in brca2 mutants, these dnd-knockdown animals were 12 months older than our brca2 mutants, suggesting that invasive proliferation might arise in brca2 mutants as they age. Overall, these results would be expected if somatic cell neoplasias in brca2 and brca2;tp53 mutants were not due to a direct effect of the lack of brca2 activity, but arose as a secondary effect of germ cell loss in brca2 mutants. A possible mechanism to explain these results is that late stage germ cells in the wild-type spermatogenic pathway exert a negative control over the proliferation of somatic cells in zebrafish testes. Loss of Dead end function in mouse results in germ cell tumors in a strain-specific manner [65]. Because dnd-knockdown zebrafish have no germ cells, the origin of gonad tumors after dnd-knockdown differs between mouse and zebrafish. Long-term investigations are required to examine whether the somatic testicular tumors we observed in zebrafish lacking dnd function are subject to effects of the genetic background.(A,B) Wild-type testis and tp53 single mutant testis showed germ cells at all stages of spermatogenesis: spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids and sperm. (C) brca2 single mutant testis contained spermatogonia and spermatocytes, lacked spermatids and sperm and had large regions devoid of germ cells (asterisks). (D) Testes in brca2;tp53 double mutants were similar to the brca2 single mutant, but had additional developmental problems. (E) Double mutant testis formed large cells with a single central nucleolus like spermatogonia (called here megalospermatogonia). (F) Some of these abnormally enlarged cells were pyknotic and some showed an oocyte-like morphology similar to early oocytes (inset).

Null alleles of Brca2 are embryonic lethal in mouse and human [11], [23], [66], which precludes study of the gene's full function in homozygous null-allele adults in these species. Rats lacking Brca2 activity are viable [10], but mammals are not favorable for a whole-animal small molecule screen for therapeutic substances related to Brca2 disease. Here we exploit a viable zebrafish brca2 null-allele. We show that zebrafish brca2 is the ortholog of human BRCA2, it shares important coding features with the human gene, and it is expressed in rapidly dividing and meiotic cells. Importantly, we show that brca2 maintains genome stability in response to DNA damaging agents and it is essential for the survival of post-recombinant spermatocytes. Loss of brca2 function causes female-to-male sex reversal that is rescued by mutating tp53, indicating that brca2 subverts female development by apoptosis and is required for normal oogenesis. Unexpectedly, we found that brca2 transcript localizes asymmetrically to the animal pole of wild-type oocytes and that brca2 activity is essential for establishing or maintaining the architecture of the oocyte nucleus. Moreover, results showed that brca2 activity is necessary in zebrafish as it is in humans to prevent ovarian tumors in the absence of tp53 function. Therefore, this work validates the zebrafish brca2 mutant as a useful tool for small-molecule screens to help discover potential therapeutic compounds for human patients.Genomic and genetic evidence shows that zebrafish has a single-copy of brca2 that is orthologous to its mammalian counterpart. We found that the zebrafish genome has duplicate copies of the human chromosome segment that contains BRCA2, and that these duplicates arose from the teleost genome duplication (TGD). In one of these duplicated segments, the BRCA2 ortholog disappeared, leaving zebrafish with a single copy of brca2. About 75% of genes from the TGD event reverted to singletons [27], but all of the 13 zebrafish orthologs of FA pathway genes are present in single copy [25], which would happen rarely (2.4%) solely by chance. We conclude that evolutionary forces probably acted to reduce brca2 and other FA pathway genes to single copy after the TGD. This finding is predicted by the duplication-degeneration-complementation hypothesis [67], which suggests that genes with simple tissue- and time-specific regulatory elements would be more likely to revert to singletons than those with complex regulation. In addition, many Fanc proteins join to form molecular machines in a 1:1 stoichiometry, so that if one gene in the network evolves to single copy, the others might follow by natural selection or neutral evolutionary forces.Expression analyses showed that maternal brca2 message accumulated in zebrafish embryos. This message would be available to provide embryos with Brca2 protein that could function to help resolve stalled replication forks [68] during the rapid cleavage divisions that precede the mid-blastula transition, the stage at which zygotic transcription initiates [69]. Our finding that the heterozygous offspring of homozygous brca2 mutant mothers fail to develop much past gastrulation supports this conclusion. Expression of brca2 in meiotic cells of zebrafish, as in mammals [24], suggests a role in the repair of DNA breaks incurred during meiotic homologous recombination [46].Zebrafish brca2 ZM_00075660 mutants generate only aberrant transcripts that lack domains essential for Brca2 activity and provide a vertebrate null allele model to unravel the effects of brca2 during embryonic and post-embryonic development. Mutant tissue culture cells and developing embryos show more chromosome damage and excess staining of broken DNA, respectively, than wild-type cells or embryos after exposure to DNA damaging agents. Similarly, loss of BRCA2 function in humans results in hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents [44], [70], thus leading to chromosome breaks [43], [71], showing that zebrafish and human Brca2 orthologs share functions in maintaining genome stability.Flow cytometry showed that the poor growth of zebrafish brca2 mutant cell cultures results from high rates of spontaneous apoptotic cell death. This finding parallels our finding of increased apoptosis in juvenile mutant gonads that results in oocyte loss and sex reversal and that the inhibition of cell death in brca2;tp53 double mutants rescues sex reversal. Spontaneous apoptosis leading to bone marrow failure is also a problem in hematopoietic stem cells in human FA patients, [21]. Zebrafish therefore appears to be a valid model to study the basic influence of Brca2 deficiency on apoptosis. In contrast, the effect of damage caused by MMC in zebrafish brca2 mutant cell cultures on non-apoptotic cell death rates is surprisingly low compared to humans; the cause of which remains unexplained.Results showed that brca2 mutant zebrafish developed exclusively as males due to female-to-male sex reversal. Sex ratios also appear to be skewed in the offspring of human carriers of BRCA2 mutations, suggesting a possible role in sex determination or differential survival [72]. During the sex determination period, zebrafish mutant gonads contained apoptotic cells and lacked diplotene oocytes, the presence of which is essential to tip gonad fate towards the female pathway in fancl zebrafish mutants [20]. In contrast to fancl mutants, which become fertile males, fancd1(brca2) mutants become sterile males. The more severe phenotype of brca2 mutants compared to fancl mutants parallels the fact that human homozygotes for FANCD1(BRCA2) null alleles are lethal as embryos [11]. In the FA-BRCA network, FANCL should act upstream of BRCA2 (see for review [73]. Because the phenotype of brca2 mutant zebrafish is more severe than that of fancl mutant zebrafish, BRCA2 likely plays roles in addition to its function downstream of fancl. Because FANCD1(BRCA2) is the only FA complementation group that fails to form RAD51 foci after ionizing radiation and crosslink damage, FANCD1(BRCA2), but not FANCL, is required for RAD51-mediated DNA repair [74], [75].The inhibition of apoptosis in brca2 mutants by the mutation of tp53 rescued female-to-male sex reversal and led to the development of females, consistent with the idea that brca2 mutant oocytes die by apoptosis when unable to repair DNA breaks associated with meiotic recombination. This conclusion parallels that from zebrafish fancl mutants, in which oocytes die in juveniles followed by female-to-male sex reversal [20] and supports the notion that fanc-related sex reversal acts via Tp53-mediated apoptosis.The brca2(fancd1) and fancl results combine to support the following model for zebrafish sex determination. (1) The FA network facilitates DNA repair associated with meiosis and hence the survival of oocytes during the critical period for zebrafish sex determination. (2) Activation of Tp53-dependent germ cell apoptosis, at least in fanc mutants, alters the total number of germ cells and thus reduces the number of surviving oocytes below the threshold necessary to maintain female fate. (3) Post-recombinant oocytes release a signal that down-regulates amh and/or maintains cyp19a1a (aromatase) expression in somatic cells of the bipotential gonad [20], [48], [52], [64], [76]-[80]; the fewer the number of post-recombinant oocytes, the less aromatase-maintenance signal. (4) Aromatase converts testosterone to estrogen, thereby reinforcing ovary development and the female fate. (5) In normally developing males at the juvenile hermaphrodite stage [47], unknown genetic factors that may be influenced by the environment stimulate the death of oocytes and hence loss of the aromatase-maintenance signal. According to this model, in the absence of either brca2(fancd1) or fancl, oocytes do not effectively repair the DNA breaks of meiosis, DNA-damaged oocytes die by apoptosis before they liberate the aromatase-maintenance signal, the gonad becomes a testis, and individuals that otherwise would have become females develop into males.The study of zebrafish brca2 mutants verifies the importance of Brca2 for gonad development and provides a new vertebrate model for the adult roles of Brca2 that is obscured by null mutant lethality in human and mouse. Neither Brca2 knockout rats nor Brca2 knockout mice rescued by a human BRCA2 BAC showed sex reversal [10], [24], reflecting lineage-specific sex determining mechanisms. Zebrafish brca2 mutants developed gonads without diplotene oocytes, but rescued mice did develop oocytes, many of which disappeared post-natally, but some of which progressed through meiotic prophase I, became fertilized, and produced embryos [24]; in contrast, Brca2 mutant rats were sterile. A possible explanation for the difference between mouse and rat is that the transgenic mice might not be total null mutants because expression of human BRCA2 was detected in their gonads [24].Zebrafish brca2 mutants contained spermatocytes arrested in meiosis, as did transgenic mice rescued by human BRCA2 [24] and rats mutant for Brca2−/− [10]. We found that zebrafish brca2 mutant testes (1) showed hypogonadism like human FA patients; (2) developed spermatogonia that entered meiosis as shown by sycp3 expression and histological data; (3) contained bouquet stage spermatocytes that arrested in late zygotene-early pachytene; (4) lacked post-meiotic spermatogenic stages, including spermatids and sperm; (5) failed to properly organize Sertoli cells, as shown by amh expression; (6) contained abnormal pyknotic cells that were positive for the apoptotic marker active-Caspase-3; and (7) formed tubules that lacked germ cells but contained eosinophils, blood cells involved in inflammation. Together, these results suggest a mechanistic model in which brca2 mutant spermatogenic cells develop rather normally until meiotic recombination (pachytene), fail to repair double strand DNA breaks associated with homologous recombination, then die, leaving empty testis tubules in hypogonadal sterile males.Because spermatogenic cells die even in brca2;tp53 double mutants, we conclude that, after meiotic failure, brca2 spermatogenic cells die by a Tp53-independent pathway in double mutants, or alternatively, that the hypomorphic nature of the tp53M214K allele may allow cells to disappear by a Tp53-dependent pathway. Megalospermatogonia with enormous nuclei appeared in double mutants, possibly due to continued DNA replication in spermatogonia damaged by inadequate DNA repair in the absence of brca2 activity. In brca2 single mutant testes, cells may experience extra rounds of replication but tp53-mediated cell death may delete them. Alternatively, in the absence of brca2 function, tp53 activity might be required to prevent abnormal functions that lead to cell enlargement and megalospermatogonia. The presence of oocytes in testes of double mutant animals might be explained by the alteration of somatic cell-to-germ cell signaling in testes that are developing with abnormal Sertoli cell distribution and lack of spermatids and sperm. Normal Tp53 function might be necessary to induce oocyte apoptosis in brca2 single mutant testes.Six-month old brca2 single mutants accumulated neoplastic growths involving spermatogonia with or without disorganized clumps of interstitial cells. The posterior part of the testis, which completely lacked germ cells in brca2 single and brca2;tp53 double mutants, showed abnormal proliferation of somatic cells in the testes. The investigation of genetically wild-type animals lacking germ cells due to dnd knockdown uncovered somatic neoplasias of the testes similar to those found in brca2 mutant testes. Knockdown of dnd was not previously reported to cause neoplasias, but the oldest dnd-knockdown animals previously reported were 6 months old [64] and our dnd-knockdowns were 18 months old, suggesting that these neoplasias arise with age, although we can't rule out strain-specific effects. We conclude that post-meiotic germ cells, specifically the spermatids or sperm that are lacking from brca2 mutants, control growth of surrounding somatic cells by an as yet unknown mechanism that is secondary to brca2-impaired spermatogenesis.Our gene expression analyses showed unexpectedly that brca2 transcript localizes asymmetrically at the animal pole of wild-type oocytes. The asymmetrical distribution of certain mRNAs in the oocyte cytoplasm helps to promote animal or vegetal pole identity [41], [42], [60]-[62]. In brca2;tp53 double mutants, however, the localization of messages for pou5f1, vasa, and even brca2 itself were normal, suggesting that brca2 activity is not essential to polarize the oocyte cytoplasm. Furthermore, brca2 transcript begins to be localized in stage III oocytes but ccnb1 transcripts begin to be localized earlier [41], [42], a timing that is incompatible with the hypothesis that brca2 initiates ooplasm asymmetry. The germinal vesicle (the oocyte nucleus) lies in the center of stage I-III oocytes, but moves to the animal pole by stage IV [41], [49]; thus, the oocyte nucleus -- and hence the resulting zygote and cleavage nuclei -- occupy cytoplasm enriched in brca2 transcript. The translation of this transcript would be available to support the repair of DNA damage incurred in the rapid divisions of cleavage before zygotic transcription initiates at the mid-blastula transition. The observation that brca2;tp53 double mutant females formed doubly heterozygous embryos that cleaved normally, completed gastrulation, but then died by 24 hpf supports the notion that maternally transmitted brca2 transcript is important for normal early development and that zygotic brca2 transcript is too little or too late to rescue the phenotype.brca2;tp53 double mutant females produced oocytes with normally organized ooplasm but aberrantly organized nuclei. Developing oocytes that lacked brca2 activity partitioned nucleoli aberrantly to one side of the nucleus rather than their usual radial location and distributed chromosomes opposite to the nucleoli rather than their normal central position. Although these ovaries were also homozygous mutant for tp53 (which was necessary to obtain homozygous brca2 mutant females), the oocyte nucleus architecture defect is due to brca2 deficiency because homozygous tp53 mutant females form normal oocytes [58], [59], as we confirmed. Oocytes in brca2;tp53 females reached the bouquet stage of meiosis in which telomeres cluster at one side of the oocyte. The asymmetric localization of chromosomes in the oocytes of brca2;tp53 females may result from a deficiency in DNA repair that inhibits exit from the bouquet stage. This could result, for example, if Brca2 is necessary for the relaxation of telomere clustering that generates the bouquet stage, a proposition supported by the high rate of recombination in subtelomeric sequences [81]: a high rate of recombination near the telomeres could create interlinked chromosomes like the radial reunion figures we observed in somatic cell chromosomes and these links might not permit normal chromosome dispersal in the nucleoplasm. It is unclear, however, how the abnormal persistence of chromosome clustering would generate the asymmetric distribution and abnormal morphologies of nucleoli that we found in oocytes of mutant females. Drosophila brca2 mutants develop oocytes with an abnormally asymmetric karyosome and dorso-ventral defects [46], phenotypes that may be functionally related to those we observe in zebrafish. Transgenic female mice rescued with a human BRCA2-containing BAC have abnormal polar bodies in meiosis [24], a phenotype that may be a consequence of nuclear symmetry problems we demonstrate here in zebrafish. We conclude that brca2 is generally important for the organization of oocyte nuclei both in protostomes and in vertebrates.Tp53 deficiency coupled with diminished Brca2 activity promotes mammalian breast tumors [8]. Likewise, zebrafish brca2;tp53 double mutants develop invasive ovarian tumors, and these appear earlier and more frequently than tumors in animals with lower Tp53 activity alone. We conclude that zebrafish shares with human and rat [10] a requirement for Brca2 activity to help suppress the formation of ovarian cancers. The genome instability we observed in brca2 mutant tissue culture cells may contribute to tumor formation because zebrafish gin mutations identified on the basis of genomic instability have elevated cancer risk [82]. Future studies are necessary to better understand the etiology of brca2-dependent ovarian tumors in zebrafish.FANCD1 is an alias of BRCA2 because homozygous hypomorphic mutations in this gene cause Fanconi Anemia while heterozygous null mutations increase the risk of breast and ovarian tumors and homozygous null mutations cause lethality [11]. In addition to genome instability, bone marrow failure, leukemia, and squamous cell carcinomas, many FA patients experience hypogonadism, impaired gametogenesis, defective meiosis, and sterility [19], [83]. Thus, zebrafish brca2(fancd1) shares genome instability and gonad developmental phenotypes with FA patients and ovarian tumors with human heterozygotes for BRCA2 mutations. These findings indicate that zebrafish brca2 mutants provide a suitable model for human BRCA2-related disease. In a result of special significance, the embryonic sensitivity of zebrafish brca2 mutants to a DNA damage agent provides an assay for a small molecule screen to identify compounds that can rescue the DNA damage phenotype and thus has the potential to contribute to the discovery of substances that can ameliorate at least some of the phenotypes observed in human patients.A partial gene model for zebrafish brca2 was inferred using GenomeScan (http://genes.mit.edu/genomescan.html) to match the human BRCA2 protein to a zebrafish genomic BAC clone we identified and sequenced (Genbank accession #AC149226). Primers for RACE (Clontech) were designed using this preliminary gene model. RACE template was 5′ first-strand zebrafish cDNA synthesized from pooled mRNA from embryos at 12, 24, and 48 hours post-fertilization (hpf). A BLAST search of the zebrafish EST database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/BlastGen/BlastGen.cgi?taxid=7955) using the 3′ UTR modeled with GenomeScan recovered EST CT605096. This EST and our GenomeScan model were used to design primers for amplification of the entire brca2 cDNA (primers in Table S1) using as template second strand cDNA from 60hpf embryos. Amplified fragments were cloned using the TOPO Cloning Kit for Sequencing (Invitrogen).We applied reciprocal best BLAST “hit” (RBH) [84] as an initial test for orthology of zebrafish and human BRCA2 genes. We queried the stickleback genome (http://www.ensembl.org/Gasterosteus_aculeatus/blastview) using zebrafish Brca2 and found stickleback brca2 on contig 2939. This contig, together with human BRCA2, was used to develop a preliminary gene model for stickleback brca2 (Figure S1). The Synteny Database identified paralogous and orthologous chromosome segments [26].The insertional brca2 mutant (ZM_00075660) was purchased from Znomics, which randomly inserted derivatives of a Moloney murine leukemia-based retroviral vector into zebrafish [85]. To genotype ZM_00075660, we used primers F4/R4 to amplify the mutant allele, and primers F1/R1 to amplify the wild-type allele. Table S1 lists primer sequences. To reduce Tp53 activity, the hypomorphic mutation tp53M214K was obtained from ZIRC (http://zebrafish.org/zirc/home/guide.php) and was used and genotyped as described [58]. All animals were reared and collected under standard conditions [86]. The University of Oregon Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal work (Animal Welfare Assurance Number A-3009-01, IACUC protocol #08-13). Genetic nomenclature follows guidelines from ZFIN (http://zfin.org/zf_info/nomen.html), e.g., human gene, BRCA2; mouse gene, Brca2; zebrafish gene, brca2; human protein BRCA2 and mouse and zebrafish protein, Brca2.Whole mount in situ hybridizations were performed as described [87] using several individuals for each developmental stage. In situ hybridization experiments on zebrafish cryosections were performed following [52]. Probes for amh and cyp19a1a were made following [52] and probe for vasa was made from its 3′end as described [51]. A brca2 cDNA fragment of 725nt (nucleotides 2627-3351 of NM_001110394), a pou5f1 cDNA fragment of 778nt (nucleotides 705-1482 of NM_131112), and a sycp3 cDNA fragment of 620nt (nucleotides 265-884 of NM_001040350) were used to synthesize DIG-labeled riboprobe (Boehringer Mannheim). For gonad histology, paraffin embedded Bouin's fixed tissue was sectioned at 7 microns and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.Animals were fixed at 60dpf in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 7 microns. Apoptotic cells were detected by immunofluorescence using anti-active Caspase-3 (Pharmingen, # 559565 Purified Rabbit anti-active caspase-3) following published protocols [20], [39].Animals depleted of germ cells were obtained by injecting wild-type zebrafish embryos from the AB strain at the 1–2 cell stage with dead end antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (Gene Tools) as described [88]. Injected and non-injected animals were raised to adulthood and collected at 18 months post-fertilization.Embryos were exposed to diepoxybutane (DEB) in embryo medium from 7–28hpf, or left untreated. Embryos were stained with acridine orange (AO) and mounted following [89]. The initial focal plane was the otolith, and a z-series consisting of seven 10-micron steps was captured on a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal microscope. Images were merged into a single plane with Velocity 4.4.0 and the number of AO-positive cells in the central nervous system anterior to the beginning of the yolk extension was quantified using ImageJ.Distal tips of caudal and dorsal fins from mutant and wild-type adult fish were cultured in 1∶1 (vol/vol) DMEM (Gibco) and Amniopan (PAN) media supplemented with 100 µg/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 28°C. Adherent fibroblast-like cells grew from primary explants. When culture flasks were confluent, cells were trypsinized and subcultured at split ratios of 1:4. Cells of the 20th or 21st passage were exposed to 5 or 10 ng/ml mitomycin C for 24 hrs and screened for chromosome morphology. Rates of chromatid and chromosome breaks, radial reunion figures, and other categories of breakage were scored by analyzing 100 cells from each cell line. To visualize mitotic chromosomes, subconfluent cultures were exposed to colcemid for 3 hrs. Accumulated metaphases were prepared following standard methods. Slides were stained with 5% Giemsa solution. Metaphases were screened under a light microscope. Line authenticity was confirmed by PCR genotyping using the primer set Brca2zmwt.F2 5′-GCAGGTTGTGATGAAGCCACC-3′ and Brca2zmwt.R1 5′-GTGGTGTGAGGCCAGAGGTT-3′ for amplification of a 888-bp fragment of the wt brca2 sequence and the primer set 5Fd1ins.F 5′-CTTGCGCACCAAGGCTTCAC-3′ and 5Fd1ins.R 5′-ACCGCATCTGGGGACCATCT-3′ for amplification of a 971-bp fragment of the insert. For cell growth studies, 1×105 cells per line were seeded into six flasks. Following trypsinization, one flask per line was counted daily until day 5. Resulting numbers were plotted as multiples of the initial cell count. Mitomycin C (MMC) was added at given concentrations at time 0 h. For flow cytometric assays, cultures were harvested and cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 37°C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped on ice for 2 min, then cells were pelleted and resuspended in 100% methanol at −20°C for permeabilization. For immunostaining, we used the CaspGLOW Fluorescein Active Caspase-3 Staining Kit (BioVision # K183-25) and propidium iodide (PI) counterstain at a final concentration of 8 µg/ml. Histograms were recorded on an analytical, triple-laser equipped flow cytometer (LSRII, Becton Dickinson) using Sapphire 488 nm solid state laser excitation of 5(6)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI) with appropriate filter sets to discern fluorescence intensity of different emission wavelengths. Quantification of cell distributions was by FACSDiva Software, version 6.1.Sequence of Brca2 inferred from the well-assembled sequenced genome of the stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus. The stickleback sequence was used as a comparator to infer the structure of the zebrafish brca2 gene. Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org/Gasterosteus_aculeatus/blastview) was searched using as query brca2 exons conserved between zebrafish and human. This search recovered stickleback contig 2939, the sequence of which allowed the construction of a preliminary model for stickleback brca2 by comparing contig 2939 to human BRCA2. This comparison allowed us to clarify zebrafish BRC repeats.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001357.s001(1.14 MB TIF)Analysis of zebrafish BRC repeats.

(A) Expression of brca2 during zebrafish development assayed by RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted using TRI REAGENT according to manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Research Center Inc., TR-118) from pools of 40 to 50 embryos for each developmental stage. First strand cDNA was generated from 2 µg of total RNA using Superscript III Rnase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, #18080-044) and oligo(dT) primer. Reverse transcriptase was deactivated by incubating the sample at 70°C for 15 minutes, followed by RNA digestion with RNase H (New England Biolabs, M0297S). A dilution 1:20 of the first strand cDNA was used to assay brca2 gene expression by non-quantitative PCR using the gene specific oligonucleotides 5′-GGGCCAGAAAACACAGCAACTCAAA-3′ and 5′-GCACAGGCCCAGATAGCACTCG-3′. Detection of actin expression (oligonucleotides: 5′-GAGAAGATCTGGCATCACACCTTC-3′ and 5′-GGTCTGTGGATACCGCAAGATTC-3′) was used as an internal control. Results showed substantial brca2 transcript in early (1–2 cells) and later cleavage stages, demonstrating maternal transcript, which apparently was supplemented from the beginning of zygotic transcription until at least 5dpf.

Human Fanconi anemia patients develop profound anemia of several lineages. To investigate hematopoietic development in zebrafish brca2(fancd1) mutants, we studied gene expression patterns. Results showed that 16-somite stage wild-type embryos (A) and mutant (B) embryos had the same expression pattern for the early hematopoietic marker scl (A, B) and the ‘master hematopoietic’ gene lmo2 (wild type, C, mutant, D). Furthermore, 24 hpf embryos had normal expression of pu.1, a marker of myeloid progenitors (E, F), mpo a marker of primitive myelopoiesis (G, H), and gata1, a marker of erythropoietic development (I,J). Late stage hematopoietic markers were also expressed normally in brca2 mutants, including the myelopoietic gene mpo (K,L), the leukocyte gene l-plastin (M,N), and the erythrocyte gene α-globin (O,P) in 2dpf embryos, and myb (Q,R) in 3dpf embryos in definitive hematopoiesis. In addition, expression of the T-lymphocyte gene rag1 was normal in 5dpf embryos (S,T). We conclude that, in contrast to humans but more similar to mouse, embryonic hematopoietic development appears to be normal in brca2(fancd1) mutants.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001357.s005(5.43 MB TIF)Expression of female-specific, male-specific, and meiotic recombination markers in adjacent sections of 47dpf wild-type and brca2 mutant gonads revealed male development in brca2 immature mutant testis. Oocytes in wild-type ovaries strongly expressed vasa (A) and weakly expressed amh in granulosa cells (B). Somatic cells of the ovary expressed cyp19a1a (C), but at this stage, expression of the meiotic marker sycp3 was weak in the ovary (D). Wild-type testes expressed vasa in early germ cells (E) and amh in well-organized Sertoli cells surrounding testis tubules (F), but not cyp19a1a (G). (H) Spermatocytes expressed sycp3 in wild type testes. (I–L) In contrast, brca2 mutant testes showed hypogonadism but contained vasa-expressing cells (I), disorganized and fewer Sertoli cells expressing amh (J), and no expression of the female marker cyp19a1a (K), but spermatocytes did express the recombination meiotic marker sycp3 (L).

(A–F) In situ hybridizations on serial sections of wild-type (A–C) and brca2;tp53 double mutant females (D–F). In wild-type ovaries transcripts of the brca2 (A) and pou5f1 (B) genes localized to the same small cortical region of stage III oocytes while vasa transcripts localized to the opposite pole of the same individual oocytes (C). Similarly, serial sections of ovaries from brca2;tp53 double mutants showed the same tight localization of brca2 (D) and pou5f1 (E) transcripts to one pole and vasa transcripts to the other pole (F). We conclude that brca2 function is not essential to define polarity of the oocyte cytoplasm.

However even for model fish species like the zebrafish Danio rerio the precise mechanisms involved in primary sex determination have not been studied extensively. The zebrafish, a gonochoristic species, is lacking discernible sex chromosomes and the sex of juvenile fish is difficult to determine. Sequential protandrous hermaphrodite species provide distinct determination of the gender and allow studying the sex determination process by looking at the mechanism of sex reversal. This is the first attempt to understand the genetic basis of phenotypic variation for sex determination and body weight in a sequential protandrous hermaphrodite species, the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). This work demonstrates a fast and efficient strategy for Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) detection in the gilthead sea bream, a non-model but target hermaphrodite fish species. Therefore a comparative mapping approach was performed to query syntenies against two other Perciformes, the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), a gonochoristic species and the Asian sea bass (Lates calcarifer) a protandrous hermaphrodite. In this manner two significant QTLs, one QTL affecting both body weight and sex and one QTL affecting sex, were detected on the same linkage group. The co-segregation of the two QTLs provides a genomic base to the observed genetic correlation between these two traits in sea bream as well as in other teleosts. The identification of QTLs linked to sex reversal and growth, will contribute significantly to a better understanding of the complex nature of sex determination in S. aurata where most individuals reverse to the female sex at the age of two years through development and maturation of the ovarian portion of the gonad and regression of the testicular area.

Sex determination is the process by which an organism is assigned to male or female gender. Sex-linked diseases are linked to sex determination that differs significantly among species. It is to be distinguished from sex differentiation that describes the process where an undifferentiated gonad turns into an ovary or a testis. Among vertebrates teleosts present a considerably wide range of sex determination patterns, which may be influenced by environmental parameters such as temperature or group dynamics (abiotic environmentally-controlled sex determination, ESD) or is genetically determined (genetic sex determination, GSD) (for reviews see [1], [2], [3]). Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms involved in primary sex determination of fish have not been studied extensively. On the other hand, the process of sex differentiation has been the subject of several studies in fish. Interestingly, different reproduction types in fish may occur among closely related species (e.g. tilapia, Oreochromis spp.) or even among populations of the same species (e.g. platyfish, Xiphophorus maculatus) (for a review, see [4]). Furthermore, the Teleostei infraclass is the only vertebrate class covering the complete range of sexuality from gonochorism to natural hermaphroditism (either simultaneous or sequential). Up until today, model organisms in fish have been selected on the basis of several features that are important mainly for developmental studies. Thus, even in the most common model fish species like the zebrafish (Danio rerio), the mechanisms of sex determination remain unresolved [5]. Model fish species are ideal for studying physiological and developmental processes, but they mainly represent gonochoristic species, lacking discernible sex chromosomes and the sex of juvenile fish is difficult to determine. Sequential protandrous hermaphrodite species provide distinct determination of the gender and sex determination studies can be performed through the possibility of studying the mechanism of sex reversal. Consequently hermaphrodite fish species can become a target group to study sex determination although they are not belonging to the species for which extended genome information is available. However, due to the increasing interest in aquaculture fish species, research has been made in their physiology and in molecular biology while the need for genomic resources has been addressed and is developing as for example for the gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata, a sequential protandrous hermaphrodite. For commercially important gonochoristic species like the European seabass which, like the gilthead sea bream bred communally, genotypic correlations for sex have been reported [6]. Non-monogenic traits of interest like sex determination and growth in non-model species can be detected through quantitative trait loci (QTL). Quantitative genetic variation characterizes most traits in livestock, including growth-related traits and disease resistance. Interestingly, a genetic correlation between body weight and sex reversal in gilthead sea bream was shown in 1998 by pedigree based genetic parameter estimation [7]. Correlation among growth related traits and male age at maturation was reported in the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) [8]. In the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), a QTL for maturation was identified which is close to a QTL affecting body weight. QTL markers for body weight and maturation timing were also reported for the Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) [9]. In most aquaculture fish species, sex ratio influences significantly the structure of populations and determines their reproductive potential [3]. In the case of Sparus aurata, a sequential protandrous hermaphrodite, individuals at their early stages of sexual development have undifferentiated gonads, which mature as males at the final stage of the first reproductive cycle. From the second reproduction year on they turn to females through development and maturation of the ovarian portion of their heterosexual gonad and regression of the testicular area. Zohar et al. [10] stated that sex reversal is controlled by group dynamics and social activities. Specifically, old males have a higher potential than younger males do to experience sex reversal, and the presence of high females to male ratio inhibits the sex reversal of males. Several studies have dealt with the gilthead sea bream sex change including physiology studies [10], [11], [12] as well as gene expression studies [13], [14]; however, sex chromosomes or sex-linked genetic loci still await identification. To date molecular studies have been mainly focused on the identification of genes that establish sexual dimorphism such as the transcription factor dmrt1 in testis differentiation and cytochrome P450 aromatase in ovarian differentiation. In fact, the major sex-determining gene characterized in teleost fish is the DMY gene in medaka (Oryzias latipes) [15]. The molecular toolbox produced for the gilthead sea bream which includes a first linkage map (LG map) based on some 200 microsatellite markers [16], EST (Expressed Sequence Tag) studies (e.g. [17], [18] as well as the construction of the first radiation hybrid map (RH map) of the species [19] has paved the way for genetics and genomic investigations of the molecular mechanism of sex reversal. Nevertheless, there is still need for functional and physiological studies while the absence of genome information makes QTL studies tedious and laboratory intensive. The existing molecular toolbox, on the other hand provides the possibility to perform comparative genomics analysis in order to delineate candidate regions for the traits of interests. Thus, information coming from other fish species, either model species or economically important species can be mapped onto the existing RH and LG map [20]. In this manner more targeted QTL scan is performed.In the present study we performed comparative analysis via the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) genome, of gilthead sea bream to two species with different sexuality for which growth-related QTL were detected. The first species is the gonochoristic European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax (Moronidae); here a QTL for growth was detected at linkage group 1 [21]. The second species, the Asian sea bass Lates calcarifer (Latidae), is like the gilthead sea bream, protandrous hermaphrodite. For the Asian sea bass a QTL for growth was detected at linkage group 2 [22], [23]. In order to select candidate regions from Sparus aurata genome for QTL scanning, we looked for the homologous groups for European seabass LG1 and Asian seabass LG2. In addition the present QTL scan is also linked to the results retrieved through comparative analysis to Tetraodon nigroviridis [20] where a candidate region for sex determination was proposed.Parentage assignment of sea bream progeny (552 fish), using nine microsatellites loci, indicated that 409 individuals (74.6%) were unambiguously assigned to only one pair of parents, 47 individuals (8.5%) showed multiple parental assignment (progeny could be assigned to more than one pair of parents) and 93 individuals (16.9%) showed no assignment due to no match at one or more loci or due the absence of PCR product for these loci. Simulations performed, in order to assess the confidence of parentage assignments, showed that the proportion of correct allocation of parental pairs, using the specific set of loci, was 95%. The resulting pedigree structure from the parental assignment analysis is presented in Table 1. In summary, 10 male and 48 female brooders contributed to a structure of ten paternal half-sib families with 360 males and 49 females. It has to be noted that the percentage of females accounted to originally 3% (62 females out of 2146 offspring). The average body weight (BW) of the 409 individuals was 691.7 g. Male progeny had a mean weight of 697.8 g (132–1055 g) whereas the respective value for the female offspring was slightly lower (647.2 g, in the range 248–1085 g). There was a significant difference between male and female bodyweight (P<0.05). Descriptive statistics for body weight are given in Table 2. Genotyping for the genome scan confirmed to a great extend the parentage assignment using 9 microsatellites with the PAPA software as only 10 offspring out of 419 were excluded from the QTL analysis when the rest of the microsatellite markers were genotyped. Given the 5% allowance for error rate by PAPA, the 2.4% incorrect parentage assignment using 9 microsatellite markers seems to be within the margin allowed by the software.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016599.t001https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016599.t002Growth related QTL detected in the European seabass linkage group 1 (DL-LG1) [21] and in the Asian seabass linkage group 2 (LC-LG2) [22], [23] were mapped to stickleback chromosome V (STV) and STII which correspond to sea bream RH groups (SA-RH) 11 and 18 respectively. Moreover, according to comparative mapping results, between linkage and RH maps in sea bream, SA-RH11 corresponds to SA-LG2 and SA-RH18 corresponds to SA-LG 21 (Fig. 1) from the second generation linkage map of S. aurata [20]. Therefore, fourteen microsatellite markers from SA-RH18–SA-LG21 groups (Figs. 1 and 2) and ten microsatellite markers from SA-RH11–SA-LG2 groups were selected for genotyping brooders and their offspring.Sparus aurata radiation hybrid group 18 (RH18, [20]), genetic linkage group 21 (LG21) and homologues found in three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) chromosome STII. Highlighted in bold red are the candidate microsatellite markers linked to growth and sex. Highlighted in bold are the genotyped markers for the QTL analysis.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016599.g001A. Mapping of QTL for body weight in Sparus aurata LG21: 1. One-QTL model for body weight; 2. Two-QTL model for body weight. B. Mapping of QTL for sex in Sparus aurata LG21: 1. One-QTL model for sex; 2. Two-QTL model for sex.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016599.g002Twelve out of fourteen genotyped microsatellite markers from S. aurata RH 18-LG21 (Fig. 1) were polymorphic, the remaining two microsatellite markers (Ad24 and Sa41c74) were monomorphic and subsequently removed from the quantitative analysis. The number of alleles for these markers ranged from 3 to 22 (mean  = 9). According to the results of linkage analysis the 12 microsatellites were mapped, as expected, onto the same linkage group (SA-LG21, Fig. 1) with a total length of 32.1 cM. However, exact collinearity of markers between SA-LG21 and SA-RH18 could not be established. The 12 markers are relatively close to each other, showing a mean interval of 2.92 cM.For the SA-RH11-LG2 group, all 10 genotyped microsatellites were polymorphic (2–18 alleles, mean  = 7.1). Linkage analysis confirmed linkage of the above ten markers onto the same linkage group (SA-LG2), with a total length of 64 cM and mean marker interval of 7.09 cM. In addition analysis showed no difference in the loci order of SA-LG21 and SA-LG2 groups in spite of the assumption of different recombination rate between sexes.For eight microsatellite markers, namely Hd46, SAPD00344, Did12, AJ418596, AJ418568, AF478569, SAPD00688 and SAPD00677 located in the region of interest, BAC clones were sequenced, thus genomic information around each marker is available for SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) detection (Fig. S1). BAC clones sequences are mapped onto stickleback chromosome II and in total 1,325,954 base pairs (bp) are assembled into 307 contigs (∼12 contigs for each BAC). For parts of the two main regions, STII 14 Mb and STII 15 Mb, which have been found to be genetically linked, genome information was obtained based on sequences of 8 (71 contigs) and 5 (26 contigs) overlapping BAC clones (Fig. S2 and S3). The remaining sequences of the other 13 BAC clones were mapped independently over ST II with one BAC clone, breambac-141b24, being re-located on ST XVI instead of ST II.The two regions, in which the two markers Hd46 and Did 12 were found, when mapped on the stickleback, span a genomic region of 1.58 Mb. Considering the genome size difference between stickleback and sea bream this has to be multiplied by a factor of 1.7–2 to estimate the equivalent part of sea bream's genome, which then corresponds to 2.686 Mb, under the hypothesis that there is no chromosome rearrangements in this region. This is useful information, considering that there is no recombination detected in LG21 between Hd46 and Did12 in a panel of 50 individuals (Fig. 1; [16]). Nevertheless, in the actual QTL pedigree, recombination has been detected in this region, showing that this may be a population specific parameter. Such data offer a measure of recombination rate, a parameter that in many cases is affected in a sex specific way and may constitute an indication of sex-related effects. For two microsatellite markers, namely Did12 and breambac-118g4, which were independently genotyped, linkage analysis revealed that they are separated by 1.8 cM from each other (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis showed that they are describing the same locus (Fig. S4).QTL analysis, using half-sib interval mapping [24], revealed a significant QTL controlling body weight (QBW1) at position 20 cM of LG21 (Fig. 2A1). QBW1 is located between Hd46, Eld36 and SaGT1 microsatellite markers and was found to be significant both at 5% and 1% levels of significance and a chromosome-wide scale (Table 3). Moreover, when a two QTL model was fitted, two peaks (QBW2 and QBW3) of the test statistic appeared on LG21 (Fig. 2A2), both significant at the 5% level (Table 3). However, the comparison between the two models (Table 3) suggested that the one-QTL model was of better fit (showing a higher variance ratio). On the other hand, fitting one- and two-QTL models on LG2 showed no significant association between any of the markers and body weight. Test statistics, significance thresholds, mean size of effect and position of detected QTL on LG21 for one and two QTL models are presented in Table 3.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016599.t003Regarding QTL detection for sex determination, under the assumption of one QTL model, the analysis did not reveal any significant QTL on LG21 (Fig. 2B1, Table 3). However, when a two-QTL model was fitted, two peaks (QS2 and QS3) of the test statistic appeared on LG21 (Fig. 2B2) both significant at the 5% significant level at a chromosome-wide scale (Table 3). The two QTLs are located at position 20 cM of LG21 (Fig. 2), as it was the case for QBW1 affecting body weight and at 6 cM which is 1.1 cM far from marker BMAP54 (Fig. 2). The test statistic for the two-QTL model was quite high (Table 3), despite the low percentage of females in the offspring panel (12%). Finally, QTL analysis in showed no significant QTL associated to sex determination in LG2, using both QTL models.Most methods used for assigning parents to offspring do not provide a 100% confidence of correct assignment, but usually allow between a 1% and 5% level of error, as was the case in the present study. However, such pedigree mistakes result in a small loss of QTL detection power [25] and can be improved when individuals are genotyped with more markers for linkage analysis and QTL mapping purposes. Since the gilthead sea bream is a sequential mass spawner the contribution of 10 male and 48 female brooders to the population structure in the present study was expected [26]. Offsprings were collected at the age of 2 and sexing was performed by stripping. The percentage of females amounted to 3% (62 females out of 2146 offspring). The small presence of females in the progeny was expected, as old males have a much higher potential to go through sex reversal than younger males do, thus at two years of age only a few male individuals have turned into to the female sex. The exact time point of fish changing sex varies. The percentage of females during the second year has been reported to vary from 15% to 80% [10], [27], [28], and in the third year this percentage may increase to 63% [28]. However another study showed that gonadal development is at the end of the second and beginning of the third reproduction cycle [13], emphasizing the population specific behavior of sex reversal. For analysis purposes the structure of ten paternal half-sib families with 360 males (∼88%) and 49 (∼12%) females were chosen.The rapid developments in genomics of fish paved the way to new and valuable research in comparative genetics and genomics. With the accumulation of genomic information in model species, the genetic and genomic characterization for non-model, but economically important species such as the gilthead sea bream, is now feasible. Only recently Massault et al. [29] identified two QTLs for body weight; DL-LG4 and DL-LG6. Corresponding RH groups here are RH 2 and 12, respectively. In seabream recently Massault et al. [29] described a QTL for body length on RH1/LG6 [30]. In addition, the comparison of low coverage gene maps of aquacultured fish species against the fully sequenced fish species enhances the efficiency of candidate genes identification projected for QTL scans for traits of interest. Specifically, the previous study from Sarropoulou et al. [20] demonstrated a well-conserved gene order between SA-RH18 and chromosome 5 of Tetraodon nigroviridis. In this particularly well-conserved region of Tetraodon chromosome 5 the genes for gonadal P450 aromatase (or cyp19a1a) and brain aromatase (or cyp19a1b, neural aromatase, P450aromB) were located [20]; the former is a neural marker of estrogen effect known to be involved in sex differentiation [31], [32], [33], the latter catalyzes the key step in estrogen biosynthesis [34], [35] and is also a neural marker of estrogen effect in teleosts. In addition, SA-RH18 and Tetraodon chromosome 5 correspond to LG1 of tilapia [20], in which a candidate sex-determining region was mapped [36], [37]. Our results, regarding the detection of two sex-linked QTL in SA- LG21 (Fig. 2, Table 3), testify the great power of comparative genomics for targeted QTL scanning.The insufficient genomic information for direct comparison between sea bream the European sea bass and the Asian sea bass, for which growth-related QTL were detected [21], [22], was bridged by comparative mapping through the fully sequenced genome of stickleback. The highest percentages of significant hits by BLAT analysis for S. aurata were obtained by comparing it to the three-spined stickleback (58%), followed by medaka (32%) and Tetraodon (30%) [38]. Thus, stickleback was used as stepping stone that allowed passing from the European and the Asian sea bass linkage groups of interest (DL-LG1 and LC-LG2, respectively) to their gilthead sea bream homologous RH groups (SA-RH11 and SA-RH18, correspondingly). Looking at the biology of both species, the European sea bass is a gonochoristic species with a spawning period between December and March in the Mediterranean and up to June in the Atlantic, whereas the Asian sea bass belongs to the protandrous hermaphrodites [39] like S. aurata, and is a diadromous fish which spawns in estuaries and inhabits rivers. QTL affecting growth-related traits in sea bream was detected in SA-RH18 (LG21; Fig. 2 and Table 3) corresponding to LC-LG2 of Asian seabass. However, no statistical significance for QTL affecting growth-related traits was found in SA-RH11 the corresponding LG of European sea bass (DL-LG1) for which linkage to growth has been shown by Chatziplis et al. [21]. We suggest that targeted QTL scans through comparative genomics can be even more powerful when also taking into account the physiological characters of the examined species.Optimal designs for QTL detection depend on the specific characteristics of a species and, therefore, appropriate designs appropriate for terrestrial livestock species may be not transferable to aquaculture species. A major complication in mass-spawning fish species is that, in general, the effective number of parents is much lower than their total number. Consequently, the contribution of different individuals may extremely vary and in some cases brooders do not even contribute at all [26]. This mode of reproductive behavior is also reflected in our data where, from a panel of 16 males and 109 females brooders, 10 males and 48 females have finally participated to the creation of ten paternal half-sib families with family size ranging from 7 to 115 progeny. On the other hand, simulation studies underline the importance of family structure in experimental design and its major effect on the power to detect QTL [25]. More specifically, when a QTL, explaining 15.5% of the phenotypic variation, is segregating, it was shown that analyzing half-sib family designs with a regression method, a power of 80% for QTL detection can be obtained by using five families with 100 offspring each when a QTL [25], [40]. As a general rule it is suggested to analyze fewer larger families than more families with fewer offspring. In practice, such large and equally sized families are difficult to obtain in mass-spawning species like S. aurata, and it is more likely to have a variety of family sizes due to the unequal contribution of brooders. In the last case, more individuals should be genotyped to ensure lots of offspring per family. However, given the family size and structure in the present study, sufficient power for QTL detection can be assured. In addition the domestication process was in its early phase and since no systematic selective breeding has been operated the populations possess high levels of genetic variation that makes them ideal for QTL detection through full- and/or half-sib families.Seabream is considered a sequential protandrous hermaphrodite species. Karyotype analysis has not revealed the existence of sex chromosomes [41]. Therefore, in the QTL analysis of sex determination (positions 6 and 20 cM on LG21; Fig. 2B2), the sex of the fish was treated as polygenic binary trait scored as one (male) or two (female). The same regression analysis was used for body weight [24], since simulation studies showed that regression methods for QTL mapping are also applicable to binary traits even in unbalanced half-sib family designs [42], [43], [44]. When applying the linear regression method in an unbalanced multi-family half-sib design of 500 progeny and for a 15% incidence of the binary trait, Kadarmideen et al. [42] suggested that a power of 88.4% for QTL detection of binary traits can be obtained at P<0.05 level of significance.Body weight was significantly associated with a QTL (QBW1; Fig. 2A1) in position 20 cM of LG21. QBW1 seems to be tightly linked to body weight, as it was found significant at both 5% and 1% levels of significance at a chromosome-wide scale (Table 3). Furthermore, comparison between the one- and two-QTL models shows that the existence of a single QTL is more likely to be affecting the body weight in the linkage group 21 of S. aurata. The most likely position for QBW1 is between microsatellite markers Hd46, Eld36 and SaGT1 (Figs. 1 and 2A1). BAC sequence data provided here which include mapped microsatellite markers, confirm mapping results, will enable fine mapping of the detected QTL as well as further comparative studies.Elucidation of the full spectrum of processes that lead to sex change in gilthead sea bream requires detailed data derived from physiological, molecular, cytogenetic, genomic and genetic surveys. Up to date, the mechanism of S. aurata sex reversal is thought to be controlled by social activities and group dynamics [10], [11]. Changes in these environmental factors are the signals received by the brain and finally lead to differential expression of specific genes (cyp19a1a [14]) during sex change. Our study provides strong evidence for the presence of genetic control in sex reversal of this teleost fish. The two sex-linked loci detected in SA-LG21 group (QS2 and QS3; Fig. 2) were found significant at the 5% level of significance whilst their variance ratio was also very close to the 1% threshold value (Table 3), despite the imbalanced design comprising 12% of females in the offspring panel. Another noticeable result herein is that QS3 is located at the same position of SA-LG21 (20 cM) as the QBW1 affecting body weight (Table 3). This pleiotropy between QTL could explain partially the genetic correlation between body weight and sex reversal in sea bream, suggested also in Batargias [7] by pedigree-based genetic data analysis (i.e. genetic parameter estimation), and it further supports our hypothesis of genetic control in sex determination apart from environmental factors. In addition the finding of the QTL for weight and the QTL for sex at the same genomic position is in line with newer synthesis about sex determination in fish.In the case of sea bream, it has been shown that the contribution of males to next generation follows a concave distribution [45], [46], and after a certain size it is negatively correlated with weight, showing that there is an evolutionary trade-off between male size and sex reversal. The nature of this interaction is not known, but having defined one possible genomic region where the phenomenon is located, together with the power of new generation sequencing keeps promise for reaching deep insights in the genetics and the evolutionary drivers of sex determination in fish. Our findings combined with results from previous studies may not be limited to this species but could potentially yield further insight into the general phenomenon of hermaphroditism, as this reproduction pattern is observed in a significant number of fish and especially in sparids.In conclusion, we demonstrated a fast and efficient strategy for QTL detection through comparative genomics and linkage analysis. We identified in this way two significant QTLs, one for body weight and one QTL affecting sex determination, both located in linkage group 21. Our results were verified in ten paternal half-sib families comprising of totally 409 progeny. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of QTL detection associated with sex and body weight in Sparus aurata. In addition, we provide BAC sequence information for SNP detection in order to enable fine mapping of QTL as well as comparative studies. Having defined one possible genomic region where linkage to sex determination has been shown together with the power of next generation we expect to obtain access to the molecular basis of nature of sex reversal as well as to the relation of sex reversal and growth.No ethic statement is required for this study. Fish handling was carried out according to the European Union Directive (86/609EEC) for the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes [47] and the “Guidelines for the treatment of animals in behavioural research and teaching” [48], [49].A commercial broodstock of 125 brooders was selected based on prior records of good performance indicating high genetic value. This broodstock consisted of 109 females and 16 males maintained under natural photoperiod. The brooders were allowed to naturally mass spawn in order to obtain relatively lots of families with large family sizes for subsequent genetic parameter estimation and QTL analysis.Natural mass spawning took place in April 2002. The collected eggs originated from a single spawning day. Approximately 1.6 million larvae were collected from the egg incubators and placed into two larval rearing tanks. The larvae stayed for 55 days in tanks, where they were sequentially fed with algae, rotifers and Artemia, and commercial feed. At the age of 55 days post-hatching, each of the larval tanks was transferred to a concrete raceway tank. Only fish from the first concrete raceway tank were used in the experiment while the second was held as a back-up population. Since the fish were originating from the same batch, were growing under identical environmental conditions (same tanks) in all rearing and growing stages of the same time period and were fed the same feed in all periods, there were no fixed effects to take into account. Consequently, there were not any fixed effects present in the experiment. The feeding regimes of differently sized commercial pellets were followed thereafter, including the on-growing period, according to age and weight.Rearing procedure followed the company's common practice with the exception of avoiding the grading in order to preserve the whole spectrum of variance of the population. In September 2002, approximately 70,000 fish with an average weight of 7.21 g, were transferred into a circular tank appropriate for their size and mean weight. In January 2003, approximately 12,000 of the fish above, weighting 31.5 g (average), were transferred to one of the company's cage sites and were again placed in a small cage appropriate for their size and mean weight.In April 2004, 2527 fish were gradually anesthetized with 3-phenoxy-ethanol and each fish was PIT-tagged and fin-clipped, with the fin clip preserved in absolute ethanol for further DNA genotyping. In December 2004, the fish were sampled at the cage site. During this procedure 2146 fish with mean weight of 702 g were gradually anesthetized with 3-phenoxy-ethanol, weighed to the nearest of 1 g, photographed with a Nikon digital camera and sexed by stripping. Sexing by stripping two year old sea bream means that the individuals are classified into three categories: the spermiating males (2029 individuals), indicated by the presence of sperm, the females (62 individuals), indicated by the presence of eggs, and the unidentified (54 individuals), indicated by the absence of both sperm and eggs which were probably immature or mature females, but not in ovulating condition at the time of stripping.Genomic DNA was isolated from fin clips of 125 brooders and 552 offspring from the initial offspring panel (n = 2146), by standard proteinase-K digestion, following the salting out procedure as described in Miller et al. [50]. The selected offspring consisted of 490, randomly selected, male individuals and all the female fish (n = 62, as described above). The quality and quantity of DNA was checked using a NanoDrop 1000 Spectophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The DNA concentration of each fish was adjusted to 20 ng/µl through dilution with distilled water and arrayed into 96-well PCR plates.For parentage analysis, parents and offspring were genotyped with a multiplex of nine microsatellite markers, from which six (CL2416Contig1, CL120Contig1, cDN14P0004O13.F.ab1, CL2598Contig1, CL2595Contig1, cDN08P0004J06.F) were newly developed and the other three (Dd67, Hd46, Eld36) were from RH 18 (Fig. 1). The selection of the loci set was based on their polymorphism and unambiguously sized PCR product. All multiplex PCRs were performed in 10 µl volumes containing 1 unit of Taq polymerase (GenAxxon, Biberach, Germany), 1× Taq buffer S, 0.25 mM dNTPs mix, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.35 µM of each forward and reverse primer, and approximately 20 ng of template DNA. Cycling conditions for the multiplexes amplification consisted of an initial 95°C denaturation step for 3 min followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 90 s at 57°C, and 60 s at 72°C, with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Fluorescently labeled PCR products were separated on an ABI PRISM 3700 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Inc. [ABI], Carlsbad, CA, USA), using 5′-labeled reverse primers and the GeneScanTM-500 LIZ Size Standard (ABI) as internal size standard. Alleles were sized and individuals genotyped using the software STRand 2.3.79 (http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/informatics/STRand).Genotype data of brooders and offspring were analyzed using the PAPA 2.0 software [51] for parentage assignment. PAPA calculates the likelihood of each potential parental pair and if one pair has a likelihood greater than that of all the other pairs then the offspring is allocated to this pair. The allocation analysis was run without allowing for mismatching genotypes and simulations were carried out with several iterations and with the same parameter values as those used in the allocation procedure (same set of parental genotypes and same number of parents and offspring), in order to assess the correctness of allocations for parental pairs.All sequences used in the present study were in silico mapped to the stickleback genome sequence using BLAT algorithm. BLAT searches were performed using q = dnax and t = dnax with a score above 80 and an alignment length above 50 bp, as is recommended for mapping ESTs to the genome across species [52]. Genome sequence data for stickleback were retrieved from the draft assembly produced by the Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard in February 2006.Linkage analysis and ordering of the linkage groups were performed using the CRI-MAP 3.0 software [53]. Using the ‘prepare’ option of the software, we also checked for non-Mendelian inheritance. Marker assignment to linkage groups was performed by pairwise analysis, where the marker order with the highest likelihood was selected from all the other possible orders. Linkage groups were built assuming an equal recombination rate between sexes; however, the loci order was also checked (using the ‘Flips’ option of CRI-MAP), assuming different recombination rates between sexes. The linkage distances for sex-average and sex-specific linkage groups was estimated assuming the Kosambi mapping function [54].Twenty-six candidate BAC clones located through in silico comparative mapping to stickleback chromosome II (STII, see Fig. 1) were shotgun-sequenced on a Genome Sequencer FLX 454 Sequencer using a Titanium Library Preparation kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The resulting contigs were manually verified and submitted to GenBank under accession numbers HQ021443–HQ021749. Stickleback STII corresponds to S. aurata RH group 18 [38]. All molecular markers of RH 18 were used to locate their sequence on the sequences resulting from the 26 BAC clones. Markers physically located on one contig or within one BAC were compared to results from the linkage analysis.Given the pedigree structure from the results of the parentage analysis results the QTL detection method was based on half-sib interval mapping analysis as described by Knott et al. [24]. For a given position of one Kosambi centimorgan (cM) interval between the marker genotypes with sex-averaged marker distances, the probability of one offspring inheriting one of its parent's alleles at that position is calculated conditional upon its marker genotype. For any given position these conditional probabilities are the independent variable on which the phenotypic score is regressed. The estimate of the position of the putative QTL is determined by the highest variance ratio and the size of each effect is estimated in that position by the regression coefficient of the analysis [24]. Since the conditional probabilities are available, various genetic and environmental models can be fitted, e.g. effects of environmental factors (fixed effects) or covariates, interactions of QTL with fixed effects etc. No fixed effects were observed in this study; however, it was possible to fit both one and two linked QTL models using sex as random effect when body weight trait was analyzed. The software GridQTL 1.3.2 (see http://www.gridqtl.org.uk) was used to perform the analysis as described by [55]. The 1% and 5% significance threshold values were determined at a chromosome-wide level, for each trait separately, using permutation techniques [56]. The phenotypic data were permutated and analyzed 1000 times and the highest variance ratio was stored after each permutation and analysis. The 10th and 50th highest values after sorting the 1000 variance ratios were the 1% and 5% significance thresholds for each trait, respectively.Assignments of BAC clones to molecular markers mapped onto Sparus aurata RH18 group.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016599.s001(PDF)Alignment of candidate BAC clone sequences isolated around the candidate molecular marker Hd46 (breambac-141g16) for QTL affecting growth-related traits as well as sex onto the genome of three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus).

Learn about our remote access optionsEndocrine‐disrupting chemicals released into natural watercourses may cause biased sex ratios by sex reversal in fish populations. The present study investigated the androgenic sex reversal of zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to the androgenic compound 17β‐trenbolone (TB) and whether sex‐changed females would revert to the female phenotype after cessation of TB exposure. 17β‐Trenbolone is a metabolite of trenbolone acetate, an anabolic steroid used as a growth promoter in beef cattle. 17β‐Trenbolone in runoff from cattle feedlots may reach concentrations that affect fish sexual development. Zebrafish were exposed to a concentration of 20 ng/L TB in a flow‐through system for five months from egg until sexual maturity. This resulted in an all‐male population. It was further found that all these phenotypic males displayed normal male courtship behavior and were able to reproduce successfully, implying that the sex reversal was complete and functional. None of the phenotypic males developed into females after six months in clean water, demonstrating that androgenic sex reversal of zebrafish is irreversible. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2010; 29:1828–1833. © 2010 SETACThere is unambiguous evidence that endocrine‐disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can impair reproduction and have long‐term effects on fish populations in the wild 1, 2. Endocrine‐disrupting chemicals interact with the reproductive hormones, causing a number of reproductive disturbances. First, sex determination in teleost fish is very labile and can be disturbed or even functionally reversed by external application of hormones at critical developmental stages 3. Second, the aquatic environment represents a sink for most anthropogenic contaminants, and fish populations are directly exposed to a wide variety of EDCs originating from industrial, agricultural, or municipal effluents. In later years, increasing attention has been devoted to chemicals with androgenic effects 4-7. Early evidence of masculinization of fish in the wild by these xenoandrogens was the masculinization of female mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis holbrooki) downstream of pulp mills in the United States 8. Several studies have focused on the environmental impact of anabolic growth promoters from animal feedlot effluents, including the highly potent synthetic androgen trenbolone acetate 4, 9. 17β‐Trenbolone (TB), which is used in the present study, is a metabolite of trenbolone acetate and is excreted by cattle treated with trenbolone acetate implants 10. 17β‐Trenbolone is moderately stable both in animal waste and in the environment, with a half‐life in the order of 260 d in liquid manure 11. It binds with high affinity to fish androgen receptors 12 and has been demonstrated to masculinize female fish, alter gonad morphology, and reduce fecundity at nanogram concentrations 5, 12. Concentrations of 10 and 20 ng/L TB have been measured in feedlot runoff 10. Sexual development in teleosts is protracted and very plastic 3, 13, and the teleost gonad shows a general developmental bipotentiality 3. Fully functional female‐to‐male sex reversal can be induced by exposing juvenile fish to androgens 13.The objective of the present experiment was to determine whether zebrafish from an all‐male population, resulting from a lifetime exposure to 20 ng/L TB, develop into fully functional males with the ability to perform male courtship behavior and successfully reproduce. This would provide the first evidence that androgenically induced sex change in zebrafish is complete and functional and not just morphological. A further goal was to test the reversibility of the masculinization.A stock of 400 zebrafish (Danio rerio) was obtained from Credo Fish (Aalborg, Denmark). Approximately 15 males and 30 females were randomly selected from the stock to produce progeny for each of three replicas. At 1 d posthatch (dph), 500 eggs were placed in each of six (46 × 28 × 28 cm; L × W × H) seamless glass exposure tanks (Struers KEBO Laboratory, Copenhagen, Denmark). The hatched fish were transferred to larger tanks (65 × 31 × 31) at 30 dph, and the fish load in each tank was scaled down to 60 individuals at 60 dph. Larvae were fed daily with Tetra‐Min Baby (Tetra Werke) and boiled egg yolk. From 10 dph, the diet was supplied with live Artemia. Adult zebrafish were fed daily with Tetra‐Min and live Artemia ad libitum. The stock tank and the exposure tanks were supplied with water from a header tank, containing aerated, demineralized water at 28°C, mixed with tap water (16:1) and adjusted with NaCl to give a conductivity of 275 ± 9.0 µS. Water was carried from the header tank to the exposure tanks at a flow rate of 57.6 L per day via peristaltic pumps (Ole Dich Instrument Makers). An outlet with a filter maintained the volume in the exposure tanks at 22 L, resulting in a continuous flow‐through system. The oxygen content was 82.3 ± 6.1%, and the pH during exposure was 7.5 ± 0.2. The load of ammonium, nitrate, and nitrite was measured with tetratest (Tetra Werke) and did not exceed recommended values. Water quality was consistently fine at all times during the experiment, and there were no differences in water quality between tanks. The photoperiod was 14:10‐h (light:dark), and a sunrise was simulated before the light was turned on.The zebrafish were exposed to 20 ng/L 17β‐trenbolone from 1 dph until 150 dph, when they had reached sexual maturity 14. The control group, receiving only the carrier solvent, acetone, and the TB‐exposed group both consisted of three replicas. The nominal concentration of acetone in the exposure tanks was 16.3 µl/L, which is lower than the maximum recommendable value. A stock solution of 1,214 ng/L 17β‐trenbolone (4,9,11‐estratrien‐17β‐OL‐3‐ONE ACETATA; Steraloids) was dissolved in acetone and stored in the dark at 4°C. New stock solutions were made every fifth day. A programmable syringe pump (Multi‐Phaser™; Braintree Scientific) dosed the solutions continually from six 50‐ml syringes to the inlet water from the peristaltic pumps, using Hamilton needles. The tanks were cleaned for feces daily.The actual concentration of TB in water samples was analyzed by 1200 Series high‐performance liquid chromatography and a 6410 triple quad mass spectrometer (MS), both from Agilent Technologies.Behavioral trials were carried out with randomly selected fish from the TB exposure tanks and male fish from the control tanks, respectively. The test tanks (28 × 13 × 21 cm) contained 6 cm water from the stock tank at 26°C. The low water level limited vertical movement of the fish, which could disturb the behavioral measurements. The test fish and a standard female zebrafish were then placed in the test tank. Standard females were mature females from the stock tank. To enhance the probability that these standard females were ready to spawn at the behavioral trial, they were isolated from males for 5 d prior to the behavioral test. To stimulate egg development, water with pheromones from the stock tank was added daily to the tanks with the isolated females.During zebrafish courtship behavior, the male tries to attract the female and lead her to the spawning ground. He then entices her to spawn with rapid tail oscillations against her side 15. To ensure a suitable spawning area, a plastic tray (10 × 10 cm) with transparent marbles (0.5 cm diameter) was placed in one corner of the test tank. The two fish were acclimated in the test tank overnight, separated by a partition wall. On the next morning, the test tank was placed on a sheet of glass 50 cm above diffusely lit white paper (79 lux). The entire setup was enclosed in a metal frame covered with a blackout curtain to exclude visual disturbances. When viewed from above, this arrangement resulted in clear silhouettes of the two fish, in which the male was distinguishable from the larger female. After removal of the partition wall, the scenario was recorded for 45 min following a simulated 4‐min sunrise (1–134 lux).A CV‐M10 progressive scan (noninterlaced) CCD camera (JAI, Copenhagen, Denmark) was mounted approximately 50 cm above the test tank. The analogue video signal from the camera was digitized by a DT3154 frame grabber (Data Translation) into a 768‐ × 576‐pixel digital image, giving a 0.36‐mm spatial resolution of the visual field. The frame grabber was interfaced with a 2‐GHz Pentium 4 personal computer.The behavioral measurements were controlled by the MOTIO vision system (Department of Biological Sciences, University of Aarhus). Prior to recording, the interior of the test tank was framed by a software window (region of interest), and appropriate ranges of gray level, area, perimeter, and form corresponding to the fish silhouettes were likewise set in the software. The centroids of the two pixel assemblages fulfilling both gray‐level and shape criteria were calculated and recorded as the x,y positions of the two fish. The resultant time series of x,y coordinates was stored in a primary data file together with information on the experiment and calibration factors for the conversion of pixel values into millimeters. During the 45‐min recording, an image was captured and processed approximately every one‐twelfth of a second.The raw data files containing the time series of fish positions were transformed into series of connected vectors and analyzed by the MOTIO software. The male courtship behavior was evaluated on the basis of the following eight parameters: total swimming distance (m), average velocity (mm/s), turning rate (°/s), swimming distance in spawning area (m), visits to spawning area, number of meetings with the standard female, total duration of meetings (min), and average distance between test fish and standard female (mm). The program has previously been used to investigate zebrafish behavior successfully 16.The male fish were placed individually in visually isolated tanks (20 × 15 × 20 cm) with 10 cm water and two standard females. The bottom was covered with colored glass marbles to minimize oophagy. The fish were fed live Artemia ad libitum. The bottom of the tanks was cleaned for feces and eggs were collected daily. The fish were held in the tanks for 7 d, and the standard females were replaced if no eggs had been spawned after 3 d. The eggs were collected 4 h after the light was turned on in the morning, after which the number of fertilized eggs was recorded. The eggs were then incubated in a Petri dish for 7 d at 26°C, and the numbers of dead eggs and hatched larvae were recorded daily, with the fertilization rate and hatching rate calculated subsequently.After the fertility tests, secondary sexual characteristics (urogenital papilla, body color, body shape, and anal fin) of each test fish were determined as masculine, indeterminable, or feminine. This was accomplished by visual observation of each individual in a test tube filled with water. A typical male zebrafish has no papilla, a slim body shape, a reddish coloration, and a large anal fin with distinct markings. A typical female zebrafish has a large, visible urogenital papilla, a round body shape, a bluish coloration, and an indistinct anal fin coloration 17, 18.The test fish were anesthetized in ethyl P‐aminobenzoate (benzocaine) solution and placed on the right side on a microscope slide under the dissection microscope. Ten microliters of 175 mM KCl solution was placed at the vent, and the fish was gently stroked three times from the abdomen to the vent with the blunt side of a pair of tweezers. The semen and the 10 µl KCl solution were then collected in a Finn‐pipette adjusted to 10 µl and transferred to an Eppendorf tube with 90 µl 175 mM KCl. The semen solution was mixed with a pipette to ensure that the semen was evenly distributed. Ten microliters of the semen solution was transferred to a counting chamber (Improved Neubauer Hemacytoeter) and left for 10 min to ensure that the spermatozoa were immobile when counting. The sperm cells were then counted under a phase‐contrast microscope according to the World Health Organization 1992 standard, and the concentration of spermatozoa in the original semen sample was determined. The zebrafish were finally killed in ethyl P‐aminobenzoate solution and blotted dry, and the weight and length were determined. Finally, the sex was confirmed by examination of the gonads under a dissection microscope.After terminating the exposure, 32 fish from the control group and 26 fish from the TB‐exposure group received clean water in flow‐through tanks for six months. Thereafter, the secondary sexual characteristics were determined, and the fish were sexed by examination of the gonads under a dissection microscope.The three replicas in each of the two groups were analyzed for normality and homogeneity of variances. When complying, differences in mean value were analyzed with one‐way analysis of variance, and the three replicates were subsequently pooled. Differences in behavior, body weight, and standard length were detected using the independent‐samples t test. When data did not comply with normality, but when simple log‐transformation resulted in normality, the t test was carried out. Homogeneity of variances was tested with Levene's test and was found in all cases. Differences in sex ratio, secondary sexual characteristics, fertilization rate, hatching rate, sperm counts, and spawning were tested with the χ2 test, performed in MS Excel 2000 (Microsoft). Power analysis was determined in JMP 7.0 (SAS Institute). All other statistical tests were performed in SPSS 13.0 for Windows (SPSS). Data are presented as mean value ± standard error. The level of significance was 0.05.The actual concentration of the nominal 20 ng/L TB was determined to be 26.1 ± 16.3 ng/L TB. In the following, all biological results refer to the nominal TB concentrations. The fish in all exposure tanks were healthy, and no differences in mortality, feeding activity, or locomotor behavior between the TB‐exposed group and the control group were observed. Courtship behavior was noticed in the control tanks from day 83 ± 4 after hatching, in accordance with other studies 16, 19. Courtship behavior was never observed in the TB‐exposure tanks.The TB treatment resulted in a nearly all‐male population, with no females and only one indeterminable individual from among 59. The proportion of males was thus 98% compared with 74% in the control group (χ2 test, p < 0.001; Fig. 1).The upper two bars show the sex ratio of zebrafish (Danio rerio) in a control group (Con; n = 171) compared with a group exposed to 20 ng/L 17β‐trenbelone (TB) from egg stage to sexual maturity (n = 59). The lower two bars represent a control group (n = 32) compared with a group exposed to 20 ng/L TB from egg stage to sexual maturity followed by a six‐month period in clean water (CW; n = 26). Black represents the percentage of males, white the percentage of fish classified as indifferent and the hatched percentage of females. Asterisks indicate the statistically significant effects of the TB treatment compared with the control groups.No significant differences were detected between the courtship behavior of the control males and the TB‐exposed zebrafish: total swimming distance (t test, p = 0.095; power = 0.386), average velocity (t test, p = 0.440; power = 0.120), turning rate (t test, p = 0.099; power = 0.379), path in spawning area (t test, p = 0.079; power = 0.303), visits to spawning area (t test, p = 0.100; power = 0.348), number of meetings with the standard female (t test, p = 0.453; power = 0.116), total duration of meetings (t test, p = 0.395; power = 0.135), and average distance between test fish and standard female (t test, p = 0.913; power = 0.051; Fig. 2).Eight measured behavioral components in the courtship behavior of male zebrafish (Danio rerio) during 45‐min trials with a standard female. No significant differences were found between the control group (n = 39) and the group exposed to 20 ng/L 17β‐trenbolone (TB) from egg stage to sexual maturity (n = 54). Entries are presented as mean values ± standard error.The males from both the control group and the TB‐exposed group were able to induce spawning in the females and to fertilize the eggs. Ninety‐four percent of the control males and 91% of the TB treated fish induced spawning during the 7 d of fertility trials, with no significant difference between the two groups (χ2 test, p = 0.738). The average fertility rate was 63.6% for control males and 52.1% for TB‐exposed fish (t test, p = 0.282). The hatching rates were 53.2% for the control group and 48.9% for the TB‐exposed group (t test, p = 0.053). The average spermatozoan concentration was 2.78 × 106/ml in the control males and 1.27 × 106/ml in the TB‐treated zebrafish. No significant difference was found (t test, p = 0.159), but it should be noted that the variation was considerable in both groups and that stripping of zebrafish males has a highly variable rate of success 20. The testes of control fish as well as TB‐treated fish appeared normal when analyzed under the dissection microscope.All TB‐exposed zebrafish were unmistakably masculinized, had male reproductive organs, and had male secondary sexual characteristics. Only very few of the TB‐exposed fish, as well as the control males, had feminine or indeterminable characteristics, and no significant differences was found between the two groups as regards coloration (χ2 test, p = 0.271), body shape (χ2 test, p = 0.190), and anal fin (χ2 test, p = 0.268). For these three characteristics, 80 to 90% were classified as masculine in both the control males and the TB‐exposed zebrafish. Regarding the fourth investigated secondary sexual characteristic, it was observed that 41% of the TB‐exposed zebrafish had a visible urogenital papilla compared with only 5% of the control males (χ2 test, p = 0.001; Fig. 3), demonstrating this nonmasculine characteristic in nearly half the population. The much larger and distinct female‐like urogenital papilla was never observed in either TB‐exposed fish or control males.Presence of urogenital papilla in male zebrafish (Danio rerio) from a control group (n = 42) compared with a group exposed to 20 ng/L 17β‐trenbelone (TB) from egg stage to sexual maturity (n = 59) and a clean water (CW) control group (n = 21) compared with a group exposed to 20 ng/L TB from egg stage to sexual maturity followed by a six‐month period in clean water (n = 26). Black represents the percentage of fish with no visible urogenital papilla, and white represents the percentage of fish with a clearly visible urogenital papilla. Asterisks indicate statistically significant effect of the TB treatment compared with the control group.The average length and weight of male fish in the control group were 34.8 mm ± 0.45 and 0.458 g ± 0.03, respectively, compared with 34.4 mm ± 0.41 and 0.414 g ± 0.02 in the TB group. There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to either length (t test, p = 0.094) or weight (t test, p = 0.278). The average weight of the testes was 0.0043 ± 0.0004 g in the control group and 0.0038 ± 0.0004 g in the TB group, and the weights did not differ significantly between the two groups (t test, p = 0.226).The 26 zebrafish treated with 20 ng/L TB for five months followed by six months in clean water were all morphological males with testes of normal appearance. No significant changes were noted in any of the four secondary sexual characteristics: urogenital papilla (χ2 test, p = 0.676), coloration (χ2 test, p = 0.828), body shape (χ2 test, p = 0.216), and appearance of the anal fin (χ2 test, p = 0.109) compared with the TB‐exposed fish that had not been in clean water. In comparison with the clean water control group, a significant difference was noted in sex ratio (χ2 test, p < 0.001; binomial test, p < 0.016) as well as in the proportion of the male fish with visible urogenital papilla (χ2 test, p < 0.001). No significant difference was observed in any of the three remaining secondary sexual characteristics: coloration (χ2 test, p = 0.692), body shape (χ2 test, p = 0.950), and appearance of the anal fin (χ2 test, p = 0.275; Fig. 2).In the present study, exposure of zebrafish to 20 ng/L TB until 150 dph led to a skewed sex ratio, with no morphologically female zebrafish. It is obvious that an all‐male population will fail to reproduce, but other extreme sex ratios will also reduce effective population size considerably, and sex reversal can thus have profound effects on population growth and persistence 21. 17β‐Trenbolone has earlier been reported to cause masculinization in female zebrafish and to decrease vitellogenin production in zebrafish, fathead minnow (Pimephales promales), and Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) 5, 6. An all‐male population of zebrafish has also been reported after exposure to 50 ng/L TB until 60 dph 6 as well as after exposure to TB concentrations of 15.4 ng/L TB and above until 60 dph (J. E. Morthorst, University of Southern Denmark, personal communication). Data on effects of TB on wildlife fish populations are very limited, but defeminization of fathead minnows living downstream of cattle feedlots has been observed 4.Although altered steroid levels clearly have an effect on sexual differentiation in fish, the trigger mechanism of sexual differentiation has not yet been elucidated 22. It is, however, known that the hormonal balance between estrogens and androgens appears to be an important factor in the cause of sexual differentiation 13, 23. The sex hormone balance depends strongly on the conversion of androgens to estrogens by the enzyme cytochrome P540 aromatase (CYP19). Most vertebrates have a single CYP19 gene, but zebrafish have two tissue‐specific genes, CYP19A1 (gonadal type) and CYP19A2 (brain type) 24. Repression of the P540 aromatase in the gonads most likely is required in order to drive differentiation toward testis development 25. Cytochrome P450 aromatase‐inhibiting EDCs such as procloraz can thus skew the sex ratio toward males 7. It has been shown that phenotypically all‐male zebrafish can be produced by exposure to the aromatase inhibitors fadrozole or procloraz during development 7, 23, 26. Another mechanism behind masculinization of fish with EDCs is agonistic binding of androgens to the androgen receptor (AR). The AR is a ligand‐activated transcription factor that binds to specific DNA recognition sites, thereby regulating the transcription of androgen target genes and mediating the effect of androgens 27. The endogenous ligands are steroid androgens such as testosterone, but some exogenous androgens, including TB, can also activate the AR and mimic the effects of testosterone 28. It has been hypothesized that TB, besides the direct effects mediated by the AR, might indirectly inhibit the production of 17β‐estradiol by decreasing testosterone production, whereby the conversion of testosterone into 17β‐estradiol by aromatase is limited 29. The precise mechanism behind the masculinizing effect of TB is still unknown.The normal percentage of males in zebrafish populations varies considerably and has in earlier studies been demonstrated to range from 46 to 69%, with a surplus of males 16, 17, 23, 30. We have no explanation for the somewhat higher 74% male proportion in our control groups.The TB‐exposed zebrafish in the present study displayed well‐developed male courtship behavior that did not differ significantly from that of control males. This result was supported by the fact that 91% of the TB‐exposed zebrafish were able to induce spawning in standard females during the fecundity trials. Female zebrafish will spawn only when courted by a male, so this confirmed that the courtship behavior of the TB‐exposed zebrafish was efficient. It was noticed, however, that the behavior of the TB‐exposed fish was slightly abbreviated from that of the control males in that they were slightly inferior to the control males in all of the measured parameters, though insignificantly. It could be interesting to evaluate the behavior of TB‐exposed zebrafish under competitive conditions, insofar as this might enhance the tendency toward a less efficient courtship. It is, however, clear that the TB‐exposed zebrafish are not only morphological but also behaviorally masculinized. This is not surprising, in that the sexual behavior in fish is strongly regulated by hormones and because early androgen exposure might permanently organize the nervous system in a male‐like manner 31.The TB‐exposed males were not stimulated by female zebrafish during their development, but in spite of this they developed the basis for functional courtship behavior. Even so, the lack of practice during their development might account for the minor abbreviations in courtship behavior. This has never been investigated, but it has been found that the social behavior of zebrafish is partially determined by their social environment 32 and that there is an aspect of early learning in shoaling preferences in zebrafish 33.It was apparent that the TB‐treated fish were all functional males. They were able to induce spawning and to fertilize eggs with a normal hatching rate compared with control males. To our knowledge, this has never been demonstrated before. Even so, there was a tendency for the TB‐treated fish to be slightly inferior in all the measured parameters compared with the control males. This could be explained if the sex‐reversed males are less efficient than the original males. It could also be an overall effect of the TB treatment on the original males of the TB‐treated group as well as the sex‐reversed males. As with the behavior, it is possible that the somewhat lower reproduction capacity of the TB‐exposed fish would have been more evident if evaluated under competitive conditions.In an earlier study, TB was found to masculinize adult female fathead minnows 12. The TB treatment in the present study resulted in a population of phenotypic male zebrafish with slender bodies, a reddish coloration, and a large anal fin with distinct markings. The only exception from an overall male‐like appearance was a high occurrence of visible urogenital papilla, which was found in the TB‐exposed groups before as well as after the period in clean water. This could be a persistent feminine reminiscence in the original females, but this would be impossible to prove insofar as there is no unambiguous way of determining whether a phenotypic male is a genetic male or a masculinized female, because no technique is available for genetic sex determination in zebrafish.In the present study, no indication of reversibility of the androgenic sex change was detected. This result is in accordance with a study by Fenske and Segner 23 who found no reversibility when zebrafish masculinized with fadrozole were transferred to clean water. In contrast to the apparent irreversibility of androgenic sex reversal, studies have shown reversibility of estrogenic sex reversals in zebrafish 18, 34, 35. Hence, Larsen et al. 34 demonstrated that male zebrafish can be restored in a 17α‐ethinylestradiol‐treated all‐female population when kept in clean water. This reversible nature of zebrafish feminization could be related to the developmental pattern in zebrafish. The zebrafish is an undifferentiated gonochorist, implying that all individuals initially develop ovary‐like gonads, which then undergo apoptosis and changes into testes at about 20 to 40 dph in the male portion of the population 30, 36. It is still unknown what directs this process, but it seems that aromatase might play an important role 23, and it has been suggested that germ cell apoptosis in the ovary‐like gonad is generated by reduction of aromatase and estrogen levels in male zebrafish 26. The transition of the male zebrafish gonad from ovary‐like tissue to testis is thus characterized by loss of germ cells 36, and it has been speculated that these germ cells are required for the ovary development in zebrafish 37. If the germ cells are absent, the gonads differentiate into testes, and the fish develop as a phenotypic male with male coloration and courtship behavior 37. Sex‐reversed males can thus be restored to a male phenotype, whereas sex change of genotypic females is irreversible because of the loss of germ cells during testis development. A similar pattern has been found in medaka, in which germ cell‐deficient fish show female‐to‐male sex reversal of their phenotype 38. Kurokawa et al. 38 suggest, based on this, that gonadal somatic cells are predisposed toward male development in the absence of germ cells. However, some disagreement exists; Slanchev et al. 39 found that zebrafish without germ cells do not have gonadal tissue at all as adults.It seems highly unlikely that a longer period in clean water would eventually reverse the androgenic effect of TB. Even should this be the case, it would have no practical significance, given the relatively short life expectancy of zebrafish in the wild 40.It is difficult to detect TB in feedlot runoff and even more so to link androgenic effects of feedlot effluent with the chemical itself 9, 10. Still, concentrations of 10 and 20 ng/L TB have been measured in feedlot runoff 10, and the concentration in the present study is thus likely to be of environmental relevance.This work was supported by the Danish Natural Science Research Council.

We identified a mutation in the zebrafish fancl gene that causes homozygous mutants to develop as fertile males due to female-to-male sex reversal. Fancl is a member of the Fanconi Anemia/BRCA DNA repair pathway. Experiments showed that zebrafish fancl was expressed in developing germ cells in bipotential gonads at the critical time of sexual fate determination. Caspase-3 immunoassays revealed increased germ cell apoptosis in fancl mutants that compromised oocyte survival. In the absence of oocytes surviving through meiosis, somatic cells of mutant gonads did not maintain expression of the ovary gene cyp19a1a and did not down-regulate expression of the early testis gene amh; consequently, gonads masculinized and became testes. Remarkably, results showed that the introduction of a tp53 (p53) mutation into fancl mutants rescued the sex-reversal phenotype by reducing germ cell apoptosis and, thus, allowed fancl mutants to become fertile females. Our results show that Fancl function is not essential for spermatogonia and oogonia to become sperm or mature oocytes, but instead suggest that Fancl function is involved in the survival of developing oocytes through meiosis. This work reveals that Tp53-mediated germ cell apoptosis induces sex reversal after the mutation of a DNA–repair pathway gene by compromising the survival of oocytes and suggests the existence of an oocyte-derived signal that biases gonad fate towards the female developmental pathway and thereby controls zebrafish sex determination.Zebrafish has become an important model for understanding vertebrate development and human disease, yet the genetic mechanisms that regulate gonad fate to determine zebrafish sex remain elusive. In this work, we describe a mutation in the fancl gene that causes zebrafish to develop exclusively as male due to female-to-male sex reversal. Fancl is a member of the Fanconi Anemia/BRCA pathway involved in the repair of damaged DNA. We find that the sex-reversal phenotype is caused by an abnormal increase of programmed germ cell death during the critical period for zebrafish sex determination in which oocytes progress through meiosis. This abnormal increase in germ cell death compromises oocyte survival, gonadal somatic cells do not maintain the female gene expression profile, gonads become masculinized to testes, and mutants develop into fertile males. Remarkably, we show that the introduction of a mutated allele of the tp53 (p53) tumor suppressor gene into fancl mutants rescues the sex-reversal phenotype by reducing germ cell death. We conclude that Tp53-mediated germ cell death alters gonad fate selection in fancl mutants by compromising oocyte survival, possibly by eliminating a hypothesized oocyte-derived signal, which alters sex determination in zebrafish.Citation: Rodríguez-Marí A, Cañestro C, BreMiller RA, Nguyen-Johnson A, Asakawa K, Kawakami K, et al.

Among vertebrates, for instance, some species use primarily genetic factors and others rely on environmental factors to cause embryonic gonads to become testes or ovaries. Genetic sex determination (GSD) includes monogenic as well as polygenic systems, and in monogenic systems the sex-determining gene is usually found on sex chromosomes that evolved from a pair of autosomes after acquiring a novel sex-determining allele (reviewed in [1]). Mammals have an XX/XY sex chromosome system with males as the heterogametic sex, but birds and many reptiles have a ZZ/ZW sex chromosome system with females as the heterogametic sex. Among fish, both sex chromosome systems have been described [2]–[7]. In environmental sex determination (ESD), factors in the environment, such as temperature, control sexual fate [2]. GSD and ESD have long been thought of as distinct mechanisms, but recent data show regulation by both genetic and environmental factors within a single species [8]. In such species, the integration of genetic and environmental factors ultimately tips the bipotential gonads towards the male or the female fate (reviewed in [9]). For example, in medaka, a teleost fish with an XX/XY sex determination system, high temperatures can sex reverse XX females [10].Despite the vast diversity of primary sex-determining mechanisms, genes downstream in the sex determination pathway appear to be broadly conserved among vertebrates. It has been suggested that during evolution, different species recruited different downstream genes to be the major sex-determining gene, sometimes relatively recently, and that changes at the top of the sex-determining pathway appear to be better tolerated than changes at the bottom of the pathway because they are less likely to have deleterious effects [11]. In mammals, the Y chromosome gene SRY (Sex determining region Y) is at the top of the sex determination cascade [12]–[16] and acts as a genetic switch that triggers the bipotential gonad to initiate the male pathway (reviewed in [17]). SRY however, does not appear to exist beyond therian mammals [18]. In several groups, including mammals, Dmrt1 (doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1) is a downstream gene in the male sex-determination pathway, but in medaka (Oryzias latipes), a duplicated copy of dmrt1 (called DMY or dmrt1by) is the major sex-determining gene [19], [20] and recent work has shown that dmrt1 is required for testis development in chickens [21]. Interestingly, dmrt1by is absent in most Oryzias species [22], showing that the upstream regulators of sex determination can change rapidly.Teleost fish show a broad diversity of sex determining mechanisms that range from genetic to environmental, from monogenic to polygenic, and from hermaphroditism to gonochorism (two distinct sexes) [2]. Zebrafish, like many other teleosts, have no obvious heteromorphic sex chromosomes [23]–[25]. Adult zebrafish have two differentiated sexes, but have been described to develop initially as juvenile hermaphrodites because all juveniles develop gonads with immature oocytes regardless of their definitive sex [26]–[28]. Zebrafish juvenile gonads contain immature oocytes that progress through oogenesis in about half of the individuals, which become females, but that degenerate in the other half of the individuals, which become males [26]–[28]. Oocytes begin to degenerate in a window of time (20–30 days post-fertilization (dpf)) that lasts several days and varies among individuals and among rearing conditions [26]–[31]. Because the sex of the zebrafish gonad drives secondary sex characters, gonadal sex determines the definitive sex of the fish. Zebrafish depleted of germ cells develop as infertile males [31]–[34] and it has been shown that the presence of germ cells is essential to maintain female fate in zebrafish [31]. We do not yet know, however, the primary genetic mechanisms that cause some zebrafish to become females and others to become males.To broaden our knowledge of the genetic mechanisms involved in zebrafish sex determination, we studied a fancl zebrafish mutant that develops exclusively as male. Fanconi Anemia complementation group L (Fancl, OMIM 608111), along with 12 other Fanconi Anemia proteins, facilitates cellular responses to a variety of stresses, including signals of DNA damage and apoptosis [35], [36] and belongs to the Fanconi Anemia/BRCA DNA repair pathway. In humans, mutations in any of these Fanconi genes can cause Fanconi Anemia (OMIM 227650), a recessive disease characterized by bone marrow failure, high risk of acute myeloid leukemia, development of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck, and developmental abnormalities in many organs including gonads, which causes hypogonadism, impaired gametogenesis, defective meiosis and sterility [37], [38]. Fancl is a member of the Fanconi Anemia core complex with a Plant Homeo Domain (PHD) that mono-ubiquitinates Fancd2 and Fanci [39], [40], which co-localize with BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins in nuclear foci to stimulate DNA repair. A severe allele of human FANCL causes a clinical phenotype that includes hematopoietic and skeletal abnormalities that are similar to, or more severe than, those typically observed in patients suffering from a defect upstream in the Fanconi Anemia pathway (H. Joenje, personal communication). We previously identified the zebrafish ortholog of the human FANCL gene [41]. Here we show that fancl homozygous mutants develop solely as males and that the absence of fancl mutant females is not due to female-specific lethality but to female-to-male sex reversal. Results demonstrated that the sex reversal of fancl mutants is not due to the absence of germ cells, but to an abnormal increase of germ cell apoptosis that compromises survival of developing oocytes and masculinizes the gonads. We found that reducing germ cell apoptosis by introducing a Tp53 (p53 or tumor protein p53) mutation rescues the fancl sex reversal phenotype, and that many double mutants develop ovaries and become females. These results suggest the model that oocytes normally must progress through meiosis to signal the gonadal soma to maintain female development, and point to Tp53-mediated apoptosis of germ cells as a factor that could be targeted by environmental or genetic signals to modify zebrafish sex determination.A zebrafish fancl mutant (allele HG10A, accession number AB353980) was generated by insertional mutagenesis in a Tol2 transposon-mediated enhancer trap screen [42]. Cloning and sequencing of genomic DNA surrounding the insertion revealed that the Tol2 construct was inserted into exon 12 of fancl, thereby disrupting the coding region of the PHD finger domain (Figure 1A and 1B), which is essential for Fancl function [39].(A) Zebrafish fancl gene structure showing the Tol2 insertion in exon 12 and the position of primer pairs used for RT-PCR experiments (arrows, F1-R1; F2-R2). Numbered boxes represent exons and dashed boxes indicate untranslated regions. (B) Schematic representation from exon 11 to 13 of the wild-type fancl transcript (1.WT) and fancl mutant transcripts (2.fanclTol2 and 3.fanclDTol2). The PHD finger domain is highlighted in grey. The Tol2 insertion is shown in black and an arrowhead points to its insertion site in the amino acid sequence in B.2. Predicted protein sequences are shown; the highly conserved Cys and His residues are underlined and the critical Trp is double underlined. Asterisks represent premature stop codons. (C) RT-PCR using as template cDNA of adult testes shows that the 232 bp band containing the intact PHD domain in wild types (amplified by F2-R2 primers) is absent from fancl mutants. The smaller band (174 bp) amplified in fancl mutants corresponds to the fanclDTol2 transcript in B.3. Abbreviations: M, DNA-Marker.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001034.g001To determine whether the HG10A Tol2 insertion disrupts fancl transcription, we performed reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments on cDNA isolated from testes of a homozygous fanclHG10A mutant adult. To learn if the Tol2 insert formed part of the fanclHG10A transcript, we designed a forward primer in exon1 and a reverse primer in the insertion (F1 and R1 in Figure 1A). The sequence of the PCR product revealed a fanclHG10A transcript that contained the Tol2 construct inserted after codon Q318 in exon 12 (arrowhead in Figure 1B line 2). This insertion is predicted to insert seven novel amino acid residues and to introduce a premature stop codon (asterisk in Figure 1B line 2), resulting in the loss of 41 of the 57 residues of the PHD finger domain. This loss eliminates the crucial tryptophan-337 (W, double underlined in the wild type (WT) in Figure 1B line 1) that is conserved in all PHD finger-type E3 ligases, as well as histidine-330 and five of the seven cysteines (H and C, underlined in Figure 1B line 1) that are highly conserved in PHD finger domains [39], [43], [44].To test if fancl HG10A mutants could produce fancl transcripts with an intact PHD domain due to elimination of the Tol2 insertion, we amplified the region encoding the PHD domain using primers flanking the Tol2 insertion (primers F2 in exon-11 and R2 in exon-13, Figure 1A). RT-PCR experiments revealed that fancl HG10A mutants lacked the expected 232 base pair (bp) PCR-product corresponding to the intact PHD domain found in wild-type siblings (WT in Figure 1C), but instead possessed a PCR-product of smaller size (174 bp) (fancl in Figure 1C). Cloning and sequencing of the F2-R2 products revealed that the small band from fancl mutants was a variant transcript that lacked both the first half of exon 12 and the Tol2 insertion (fanclΔTol2 in Figure 1B line 3). This fanclΔTol2 variant resulted from the joining of exon-11 to the second half of exon-12 due to a splice acceptor site that is newly created at the junction of the Tol2 insertion (Figure 1B line 3). The absence of the first half of exon-12 in the fanclΔTol2 transcript introduced a frameshift that generated an early stop codon (asterisk in Figure 1B line 3) leading to a predicted truncated protein lacking the entire PHD domain. These results show that homozygous fancl HG10A mutants have two variant transcripts, both of which encode products lacking an intact PHD finger domain shown to be essential for the ubiquitination function of Fancl [39].To characterize the fancl HG10A phenotype, we crossed fancl +/HG10A heterozygotes (called fancl+/− below), and after genotyping the progeny by PCR, observed that all fancl HG10A/HG10A homozygous mutants (called fancl−/− below) developed exclusively as males, even though their wild-type and heterozygous siblings developed about as many females as males. Two alternative hypotheses could explain the lack of homozygous fancl mutant females: female-specific lethality or female-to-male sex reversal. To distinguish between these two hypotheses, we crossed female fancl+/− heterozygotes to male fancl−/− homozygotes. We raised 211 progeny to adulthood, determined their phenotypic sex according to sexually dimorphic characters including the color of the anal fin and body shape, and finally scored their fancl genotypes by PCR. Under normal conditions, this cross should give 50% heterozygotes (about half of which should be female), and 50% homozygous mutants (about half of which should be female), expecting a 1∶1∶1∶1 ratio of heterozygous females to heterozygous males to homozygous mutant females to homozygous mutant males. The fancl female death hypothesis predicts a 1∶1∶0∶1 ratio, or 66% heterozygotes and 33% homozygous mutants, but the sex reversal hypothesis, predicts a 1∶1∶0∶2 ratio, or equal proportions (50%∶50%) of homozygous mutants (all male) and heterozygotes (males plus females). Resulting genotypes revealed 46 fancl+/− females: 62 fancl+/− males: 0 fancl−/− females: 103 fancl−/− males, which showed that about half of the progeny were fancl homozygous mutants (103/211, 49%) and the other half were heterozygous for the fancl mutation (108/211, 51%) (Figure 2). These results had strong statistical support (chi-square likelihood ratio  = 0.794, p-value >0.1), thus ruling out the hypothesis that homozygous fancl mutant females died. Results, however, were consistent with the hypothesis that animals that otherwise would have become females developed as males due to female-to-male sex reversal. Sex distributions within each genotype confirmed our previous observations that all fancl homozygous mutants developed as males (n = 103, 100%), and while approximately half of fancl heterozygous siblings developed as males (n = 62, 57%), the other half developed as females (n = 46, 43%) (Figure 2). These scores showed strong statistical support for the hypothesis that fancl mutants experienced female-to-male sex reversal (chi-square likelihood ratio  = 73.946, p-value<0.0001). To exclude the possibility that some of the fancl mutants could have ovaries despite their external male phenotypic characters, we dissected the gonads of adult fancl homozygous mutants (n = 45), heterozygous females (n = 11) and heterozygous males (n = 29). In all cases, we found a perfect match between external sexual characters and gonadal sex. These results ruled out the possibility that fancl mutants masqueraded as males externally while having female gonads. We conclude that the HG10A Tol2 insertion into fancl induced a female-to-male sex reversal phenotype in zebrafish.The bar graph represents percentages of expected (ex, grey bars) and observed (ob, black bars) females and males among 211 progeny from a cross of fancl heterozygous females (fancl+/−) to fancl homozygous mutant males (fancl−/−). Total numbers (n) and percentages (%) of animals in each category are indicated on the graph. The expected ratio of female heterozygotes to male heterozygotes to female homozygous mutants to male homozygous mutants is 1∶1∶1∶1, but we observed a ratio of about 1∶1∶0∶2 (46 fancl+/− females: 62 fancl+/− males: 0 fancl−/− females: 103 fancl−/− males). This result rules out the hypothesis that homozygous mutant females die, but is predicted by the hypothesis that homozygous mutants that otherwise would have become females develop instead as males.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001034.g002Because germ cells play a fundamental role in controlling female sex determination in zebrafish [31], [32], we wondered if fancl could play a role in zebrafish germ cell development. To address this question, we first tested whether fancl is expressed in germ cells of wild-type zebrafish. We analyzed the expression pattern of fancl by in situ hybridization on sections of gonads at seven developmental time points encompassing representative stages of gonad development (Figure 3), including sexually undifferentiated and presumptively still bipotential gonads (e.g. 10, 17 and 23 days post-fertilization (dpf)); transitioning gonads (e.g. 26 dpf), sexually determined but still immature gonads (33 and 37 dpf), and mature adult gonads (6 months post-fertilization). Results showed no detectable fancl expression in undifferentiated wild-type gonads at 10 dpf (data not shown), but weak expression signal appeared in immature gonads at 17 dpf and 23 dpf (arrows in Figure 3A and 3B). In transitioning gonads at 26 dpf, fancl expression increased in developing germ cells (arrows in Figure 3C and 3D), and signal was clearly detected in the ooplasm of oocytes in the ovary-like gonad (arrow in Figure 3C). At 33 dpf and 37 dpf, immature gonads showed a clear morphology of ovaries or testes, and fancl expression signal was maintained in developing oocytes and spermatocytes (arrows in Figure 3E–3H).In situ hybridizations with fancl probe were performed on cryo-sections of wild-type animals at different stages of gonad development. Weak fancl expression signal (arrows) was detected in undifferentiated gonads at 17 days post-fertilization (dpf) (A) and 23 dpf (B). Signal became stronger in germ cells (arrows) of transitioning and immature ovaries (ooplasm of oocytes, arrows in C,E,G) and transitioning and immature testes (D,F,H) at 26, 33, and 37 dpf. In adults, fancl expression was restricted to germ cells, but signal intensity depended on the stage of germ cell differentiation. In adult ovaries (I), early stage IB oocytes (eIB) already showed low fancl expression and late stage IB oocytes (lIB) showed strong fancl signal in the ooplasm, suggesting that fancl expression initiated in early stage IB oocytes. As oogenesis progressed, ooplasm volume increased, cortical alveoli appeared (stage II), yolk accumulated (stage III), and fancl expression signal became diluted. In adult testes (J), fancl expression signal was detected in a subset of cells with large nuclei and morphology consistent with primary spermatocytes (sc), but signal was not detected in cells with small nuclei in an advanced stage of spermatogenesis (i.e. spermatids and sperm (sp)). Oocyte staging is according to [49] and [29]. Scale bar: 0.1 mm.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001034.g003In adult gonads, fancl expression remained restricted to germ cells, but remarkably, the intensity of the detected signal differed depending on the stage of germ cell differentiation (Figure 3I and 3J). In ovaries, the weak fancl signal detected in early stage IB oocytes (eIB in Figure 3I) contrasted with the obvious strong signal in the ooplasm of late stage IB oocytes (lIB in Figure 3I). This result suggests that oocytes up-regulate fancl transcription before they transition into stage II. At later stages of oogenesis, fancl signal became less intense as oocytes progressed through oogenesis (Figure 3I). This reduction in staining intensity may be due to the dilution of transcript as oocytes increase in volume when cortical alveoli (also known as cortical granules in non-fish species) appeared in the ooplasm (stage II) and yolk began to accumulate (stage III) (Figure 3I). We detected low levels of fancl transcript at late stages of oocyte maturation (stage IV), suggesting that fancl is part of the maternal load of messenger RNA transcripts stored in the egg and passed along to embryos. This result agrees with our detection of fancl transcripts by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization experiments even at early developmental stages before the embryonic transcription machinery becomes active [41]. In testes, fancl expression appeared in spermatocytes (sc in Figure 3J), but not in more advanced stages of spermatogenesis, including spermatids and sperm (sp in Figure 3J). This result revealed the stage-specific expression of fancl during spermatogenesis.The finding that fancl was expressed in zebrafish germ cells during the time-window critical for gonad differentiation and sex determination (17 to 33 dpf) and was up-regulated in early stages of gametogenesis is consistent with the hypothesis that Fancl plays a specific role in germ cell development and suggests that its disruption might lead to the female-to-male sex reversal phenotype displayed by fancl mutants.Because zebrafish depleted of germ cells by dead end (dnd) morpholino (MO) knockdown [45], [46] develop exclusively as males [31], [32], and even though adult fancl mutants are fertile, we wondered if the female-to-male sex reversal of fancl mutants could be related to extremely low numbers of germ cells during stages of sex determination in juvenile mutants, or at least in those that otherwise would have developed as females and had been reversed to males. To answer this question, we performed gene expression analyses comparing gonads of fancl homozygous mutants (fancl), wild-type sibling controls (WT) and dnd-MO knockdown animals (dnd) at key stages in sex determination: 19 dpf (Figure 4A–4I), 26 dpf (Figure 4J–4X) and 33 dpf (Figure 4Y–4M'). Expression of the germ cell specific marker vasa [47] revealed the presence of germ cells in gonads of all fancl mutants sectioned (n = 15) (Figure 4D, 4P, 4S, 4E', and 4H') and sibling controls (n = 13) (Figure 4A, 4J, 4M, 4Y, and 4B'), while all germ-cell depleted animals injected with dnd-MO (n = 16) lacked vasa signal (Figure 4G, 4V, and 4K'). The presence of substantial numbers of germ cells in all fancl mutants tested even at early stages of gonad development rules out the possibility that the near absence of germ cells is the cause of the female-to-male sex reversal in fancl mutants.Comparative expression analysis of the germ cell marker vasa, the early female somatic cell marker cyp19a1a, and the early male somatic cell marker amh in developing gonads of fancl homozygous mutants (fancl) and their wild-type sibling controls (WT), and in wild-type animals depleted of germ cells by dead end morpholino knockdown (dnd). To monitor the expression of vasa, cyp19a1a and amh, in situ hybridization (ISH) experiments were performed on adjacent cryo-sections of each animal at different stages of gonad development: undifferentiated gonads at 19 dpf (A–I), transitional juvenile gonads at 26 dpf (J–X) and post-transitional juvenile gonads at 33 dpf (Y-M'). Arrows point to examples of regions showing gene expression. ISH with vasa probe labeled germ cells in wild types (A,J,M,Y,B') and fancl mutants (D,P,S,E',H'), and confirmed the depletion of germ cells in dnd animals (G,V,K'). In undifferentiated gonads at 19 dpf, female and male markers were expressed in all genotypes: WT (B,C), fancl (E,F) and dnd knockdown animals (H,I), showing that the onset of cyp19a1a and amh expression does not depend on germ cells or on fancl function. At 26 dpf, controls had started to enter either the male pathway by down-regulating cyp19a1a and up-regulating amh (K,L) or conversely into the female pathway by up-regulating cyp19a1a and down-regulating amh (N,O), correlated with the presence of few or many oocytes, respectively. In contrast, most 26 dpf fancl mutants already showed a male expression profile by the absence of cyp19a1a and the up-regulation of amh (Q,R) and only one fancl mutant showed a low number of cyp19a1a-expressing cells while nevertheless maintaining high amh expression (T,U). Except for vasa, expression profiles of 26 dpf dnd knockdown gonads were similar to fancl mutants (W,X). At 33 dpf, wild-type controls showed either a male expression profile (no cyp19a1a and high amh expression, Z,A') or a female expression profile (high cyp19a1a and no amh expression, C',D'). Most 33 dpf fancl mutants showed a male expression profile (F',G'), even if gonads maintained an ovary-like morphology (I',J'). All 33 dpf dnd animals showed a male expression profile (L',M'). Scale bar: 0.1 mm (A).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001034.g004Because all fancl mutants developed as males, we wondered if fancl mutants embark upon the male pathway from the beginning of gonad development, or whether they follow a normal bipotential pathway of development that later derails exclusively to the male pathway. To address these alternatives, we used the expression of cyp19a1a (cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A polypeptide 1a) and amh (anti-Mullerian hormone), which are the earliest sex-specific somatic gonadal cell markers known for ovary and testis, respectively, to monitor development before gonads were sexually differentiated at the morphological level [29], [31], [48].In 19 dpf undifferentiated gonads, somatic cells of fancl mutants, as well as those of wild-type controls and dnd-MO animals, expressed both the female marker cyp19a1a and the male marker amh (Figure 4B, 4C, 4E, 4F, 4H, and 4I). This result showed no indication that fancl mutant gonads were developing abnormally, which suggests that fancl mutant gonads initially embark upon the normal bipotential pathway of development, and later derail into the male pathway. The fact that individual gonads in both fancl mutants and WT siblings expressed both cyp19a1a and amh, as did animals lacking germ cells, suggests that the onset of expression of these somatic cell markers is independent of germ cell derived signals. These results extend to a much earlier age than previously noted (19 dpf versus 35 dpf [31]) the time at which gonads depleted of germ cells express amh.At 26 dpf, different individual WT juveniles showed different degrees of sexual differentiation, suggesting that this age is within the transitional period of sex determination. Some WT animals had gonads with few oocytes, low expression of cyp19a1a and up-regulation of amh (Figure 4K and 4L), while others had gonads with many developing oocytes, up-regulation of cyp19a1a and absence of amh signal (Figure 4N and 4O). In contrast to WT sibling controls, at 26 dpf, all fancl mutants had gonads with no ooctyes or just a few small oocytes, and most of them (4 out of 5) lacked expression of cyp19a1a and showed up-regulation of amh (Figure 4Q and 4R). Most juvenile fancl mutants at 26 dpf, therefore, had completed the transitional period of sex determination, and had embarked on the male pathway. Only one of the five fancl mutants analyzed retained a remnant of a few cyp19a1a-expressing cells despite the presence of a considerable number of amh-expressing cells (Figure 4T and 4U); this animal was probably still transitioning towards the male pathway. In 26 dpf dnd-MO animals, all gonads were depleted of germ cells, and like fancl mutants, showed no cells or few cells expressing cyp19a1a and many cells up-regulated for the male marker amh (Figure 4W and 4X). Therefore, most fancl mutants and dnd-MO animals tipped the fate of the bipotential gonad towards the male pathway earlier than WT controls.At 33 dpf, WT juveniles had already passed the transitional period of sex determination. Males had immature testes with no oocytes, no cyp19a1a-expressing cells and many cells with high levels of amh expression (Figure 4Z and 4A'), and females had immature ovaries, with cyp19a1a-positive somatic cells surrounding oocytes but no amh-expressing cells (Figure 4C' and 4D'). In contrast to WT sibling controls, at 33 dpf, most fancl mutant gonads (6 of 8) showed clear testes morphology, including the absence of cyp19a1a expression and up-regulation of amh expression (Figure 4F' and 4G'). Interestingly, we found two fancl mutants that still had some oocytes; in contrast to WT controls, however, these individuals showed low cyp19a1a expression and high amh signal (Figure 4I' and 4J'), which would be expected if these two fancl mutants were putative females that were in the process of sex-reversing to males. At 33 dpf, all fancl (Figure 4G' and 4J') and dnd-MO animals (Figure 4M') showed the typical male-specific up-regulation of amh. In contrast to 33 dpf dnd-MO animals, all of which lacked cyp19a1a expression (Figure 4L'), fancl mutants that still retained some oocytes showed low levels of cyp19a1a expression (Figure 4I'). These results would be expected if the presence of oocytes is essential to maintain cyp19a1a expression, and suggested the hypothesis that the female-to-male sex reversal of fancl mutants is due to abnormal development of oocytes that leads to a failure of somatic cells of the gonad to maintain cyp19a1a expression and to down-regulate amh expression.Because the Fanconi Anemia/BRCA system is involved in the repair of damaged DNA, such as that originating in meiotic recombination, we hypothesized that oocyte development is altered in fancl mutants. To test this hypothesis, we performed a histological analysis of fancl and wild-type gonad sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin at different stages of development to follow the progression of germ cells through meiosis (Figure 5).Histological comparison of germ cell development in fancl homozygous mutants (fancl) and wild-type sibling controls (WT), by hematoxylin and eosin staining of gonads at different stages of development: undifferentiated, 19–22 dpf (A,B), transitional juveniles, 26 dpf (C–F), post-transitional juveniles, 32 dpf (G–I) and adults (J–L). At 19–22 dpf, no morphological differences were observed between WT (n = 10) and fancl animals (n = 10) and both genotypes showed early stage IB perinucleolar oocytes (epo in A,B). At 26 dpf, the first histological differences between WT and fancl became apparent. Most WT controls (7 out of 9 individuals) had abundant enlarged perinucleolar oocytes that had progressed from early stage IB to late stage IB (lpo in C), and only two lacked late stage IB oocytes (E). In contrast, only one of twelve fancl mutant animals had enlarged oocytes at late stage IB (lpo in D), while the majority (11 out of 12) lacked late stage IB oocytes (F). Both wild-type and fancl mutant gonads that lacked oocytes possessed spermatogonia (sg in E,F). Remarkably, in contrast to wild types, fancl mutants showed abundant pyknotic cells (pc) at 26 dpf (D,F). At 32 dpf, gonads showed unmistakably the morphology of either ovary or testis, and in wild-type controls, approximately half of the animals (6 out of 11) had ovaries with perinucleolar oocytes at late stage IB (lpo in G) and the other half (5 out of 11) showed the typical testis morphology with abundant spermatogonia (sg) and spermatocytes (sc) arranged in cysts (dashed line in H). In contrast to controls, all fancl mutants (n = 8) had gonads that lacked perinucleolar oocytes, and showed testis morphology with groups of spermatogonia (sg) and spermatocytes (sc) (I). Finally, in adults, half of the WT controls (5 out of 10) had mature ovaries filled with oocytes at different stages of oogenesis: stage IA, IB, II, III and IV (J), and the other half (5 out of 10) had mature testes (K), in contrast to fancl mutants in which all animals (n = 7), had mature testes filled with germ cells at different stages of spermatogenesis: spermatogonia (sg), spermatocytes (sc) and sperm (sp) (L), and none of the seven fancl mutants had ovaries. Oocyte stages described according to [49]; Spermatogenesis stages described according to [28]. Scale bar: 0.02 mm (as in A, except for J).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001034.g005At 19–22 dpf, WT sibling controls and fancl homozygous mutants had undifferentiated gonads with no obvious morphological differences between genotypes. Gonads of both genotypes contained stage IB perinucleolar oocytes (arrows in Figure 5A and 5B), as indicated by the presence of nucleoli at the periphery of the nuclei [49]. Shortly after the beginning of stage IB, chromosomes decondense and form lampbrush chromosomes [50], which occurs during the diplotene stage of meiosis I as the synaptonemal complex dissolves and recombination nodules keep homologous chromosomes together [51]. We define “early” perinucleolar oocytes (epo) as stage IB oocytes that have not yet decondensed their chromosomes, and “late” perinucleolar oocytes (lpo) as stage IB oocytes that have already formed lampbrush chromosomes and entered the diplotene stage of meiosis I. Gonads of fancl (10 individuals) and WT siblings (10 individuals) at 19–22 dpf both had early (epo in Figure 5A and 5B) but not late stage IB oocytes, indicating that at this time, oocytes had not yet entered the diplotene stage of meiosis I in either genotype.At 26 dpf (Figure 5C–5F), most WT controls (7 of 9 individuals) showed late perinucleolar oocytes that had progressed through meiosis from early to late stage IB (lpo in Figure 5C), in which lampbrush chromosomes were visible, indicating that recombination had completed and oocytes had already entered the diplotene stage of meiosis I [51]. In contrast to WT, most fancl mutants (11 of 12) lacked oocytes at late stage IB (Figure 5F), indicating that oocytes in fancl mutants failed to progress through meiosis to the diplotene stage. Only one of the twelve fancl mutants showed late stage IB oocytes (lpo in Figure 5D), and this individual also contained pyknotic cells (pc in Figure 5D), some of which were identifiable as oocytes and some of which were of unclear origin due to their advanced stage in the process of degeneration. The fancl mutants that lacked oocytes (11 of 12) also had numerous pyknotic cells (pc in Figure 5F), and showed groups of spermatogonia (sg in Figure 5F), which were also found in WT animals (sg in Figure 5E) that had gonads with a testis-like morphology.The difference between fancl and WT controls became accentuated at 32 dpf (Figure 5G–5I). At 32 dpf, all fancl gonads lacked oocytes and had become immature testes with spermatogonia and spermatocytes (sg and sc in Figure 5I), but only about half of WT siblings had immature ovaries with late stage IB oocytes (lpo in Figure 5G) while the other half had immature testes (Figure 5H).At adult stages (Figure 5J–5L), consistent with results observed at 32 dpf, all fancl mutants lacked oocytes and had mature testes filled with germ cells at different stages of spermatogenesis (Figure 5L). In contrast, half of the WT controls had mature ovaries filled with oocytes at different stages of oogenesis (Figure 5J), and the other half had mature testes (Figure 5K).This analysis of developmental histology revealed that in fancl mutants, oocytes failed to progress through meiosis and rarely reached the diplotene stage. Interestingly, in contrast to wild types, we observed abundant pyknotic cells in all fancl mutant gonads at 26 dpf (pc in Figure 5D and 5F), suggesting that the absence of oocytes in older fancl mutants could be related to increased germ cell apoptosis associated with the failure to complete meiosis.To examine whether germ cell apoptosis could be the cause of both the abnormally high number of pyknotic germ cells in fancl juvenile gonads and the absence of oocytes at late stage IB, we used immunoassay to examine the activation of Caspase-3, an early marker of apoptosis [52], [53]. We scored the number of Caspase-3-positive cells in 70 gonadal cross-sections in each of 12 individuals: six wild-type sibling controls (Figure 6A) and six fancl homozygous mutants (Figure 6B) at 25 dpf, a stage within the time-window critical for sex determination. The morphology of the Caspase-3-positive cells detected in the immunoassay (shown in red in Figure 6B), and the subsequent staining of the same slides with hematoxylin and eosin (data not shown) confirmed that the Caspase-3-positive cells were germ cells and not somatic cells, and corroborated our earlier finding that germ cells that appeared to be pyknotic in our histological analysis are indeed apoptotic cells. In many cases, the shape and size of the apoptotic Caspase-3-positive cells was appropriate for oocytes, however, we cannot rule out the possibility that some Caspase-3-positive cells might be undifferentiated gonial cells (oogonia or spermatogonia). Results revealed that the average number of apoptotic germ cells in gonads of fancl−/− mutants was almost three fold higher than in gonads of wild-type sibling controls (Figure 6C) (t-test p = 0.0058, statistically significant at the p = 0.01 level). Therefore, these results suggest the hypothesis that the absence of oocytes in fancl mutants is caused by increased apoptosis of germ cells, especially oocytes, which ultimately leads to the sex reversal phenotype observed in fancl mutants.Immunodetection of apoptosis by anti-active Caspase-3 in paraffin sections of gonads of wild-type sibling controls (WT) and fancl homozygous mutants (fancl-/-) at 25 dpf (A,B). Presence of Caspase-3-positive cells (shown in red) was lower in gonads of WT (A) than in fancl mutants (B). Gonads outlined by a dashed line (A,B). Bar graph representing the average number of Caspase-3-positive germ cells in each genotype: wild-type sibling controls (WT; n = 6) and fancl homozygous mutants (fancl-/-; n = 6) at 25 dpf (C). Results showed that the average number of apoptotic germ cells in fancl mutants (x– = 99±43) was about three fold higher than in wild-type sibling controls (x– = 35±14), revealing an abnormal increase of germ cell apoptosis in fancl mutants at 25 dpf, a critical period for sex determination (C).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001034.g006The hypothesis that the female-to-male sex reversal of fancl mutants is caused by increased germ cell apoptosis predicts that blocking apoptotic pathways should rescue the sex reversal phenotype. Because tumor protein Tp53 (alias p53) is an important activator of apoptosis [54], we can inhibit apoptosis in fancl mutants by introducing a tp53 mutation into the fancl mutant line. To generate double mutants, we crossed a zebrafish female carrier of the hypomorphic mutation tp53M214K [55] to a male homozygous fancl mutant, identified double heterozygotes (fancl+/HG10A;tp53+/M214K called fancl+/−;tp53+/− below) among F1 progeny by PCR, and in-crossed double heterozygotes to obtain an F2 population containing double homozygous mutants. Among the F2 raised to adulthood, 44/171 (25.7%), or about a quarter, were fancl−/− homozygous mutants. Among these 44 fancl−/− homozygous mutants, 15 were also tp53−/− homozygous mutants, from which 11 developed as females and four as males (Figure 7A). All of the fancl homozygous mutant siblings (n = 29) that were either homozygous wild type for tp53+/+ (n = 8) or heterozygous for the tp53+/− mutation (n = 21) developed exclusively as males (Figure 7A). This result shows that the female-to-male sex reversal phenotype characteristic of fancl mutants was rescued in fancl−/−;tp53−/− doubly homozygous mutants (Figure 7A). The sex-ratio scores observed in the three genotypes showed strong statistical support (chi-square likelihood ratio  = 32.088, p-value<0.0001) for the hypothesis that the presence of females in fancl−/−;tp53−/− double mutants and the absence of females in the other tp53 genotypes (fancl−/−;tp53+/− and fancl−/−;tp53+/+) is linked to the tp53 genotype. Histological analyses of fancl−/−;tp53−/− females corroborated the conclusion that external female sex characteristics were accompanied by ovaries filled with normal oocytes at all stages of development similar to fancl+/+; tp53+/+ wild-type female siblings (Figure 7B and 7C).(A) The distribution of individuals of different tp53 genotypes among fancl−/− homozygous mutant progeny (n = 44) from an in-cross of double heterozygotes (fancl+/−;tp53+/−) is shown in a bar graph representing the number of females (purple bar) and males (green bars) distributed according to their tp53 genotypes (wild type, heterozygous or homozygous mutant). Rescue of female-to-male sex reversal was observed exclusively in fancl−/− mutant homozygotes that were also homozygous for the tp53 mutation (n = 15): 11 fancl−/−;tp53−/− animals developed as females and 4 developed as males. No rescue was observed in fancl mutants that were either wild-type (n = 8; fancl−/−;tp53+/+) or heterozygous for the tp53 mutation (n = 21; fancl−/−;tp53+/−), which all developed as males. Total numbers of animals (n) are indicated on the graph per each sex in each genotype. (B,C) Hematoxylin and eosin staining of gonad sections of wild-type female (fancl+/+;tp53+/+, B) and rescued female doubly homozygous mutant (fancl−/−;tp53−/−, C) at adult stage, revealed the presence of morphologically normal ovaries in the rescued fancl−/−;tp53−/− females. Ovaries of both genotypes had oocytes at different stages of development (i.e.: IB, II, III, IV). Scale bar: 0.1 mm (B,C). (D,E,F) tp53 mutation reduces germ cell apoptosis in fancl mutants at 25 dpf.

Dashed lines outline gonad boundaries (D,E). (F) Bar graph representing the average number of Caspase-3-positive germ cells in fancl−/−;tp53+/+ (n = 5) and fancl−/−;tp53−/− (n = 5) at 25 dpf. Results showed that the average number of apoptotic germ cells was approximately three fold lower in doubly homozygous mutant animals (fancl−/−;tp53−/−; x– = 30±56) than their fancl−/− mutant siblings that were wild-type for tp53 (fancl−/−;tp53+/+; x– = 105±71). This result shows that tp53 mutation decreased the number of apoptotic germ cells in fancl mutants at 25 dpf and demonstrates that the abnormal increase in germ cell apoptosis in fancl mutants that compromised the survival of developing oocytes was the mechanism responsible for the female-to-male sex reversal.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001034.g007To determine whether the tp53 mutation rescues fancl sex reversal phenotype by reducing germ cell apoptosis, we studied the activation of Caspase-3 in histological sections of fancl homozygous mutants that were either homozygous for the tp53−/− mutation (n = 5) or wild-type for the tp53+/+ mutation (n = 5) at 25 dpf, a critical stage for sex determination (Figure 7D and 7F). Counts of Caspase-3-positive cells of 70 gonadal cross-sections per animal in these ten animals showed that double homozygotes (fancl−/−;tp53−/−) had an average number of apoptotic germ cells approximately three fold lower (Figure 7E and 7F) than their fancl−/− mutant siblings that were homozygous wild-type for the tp53+/+ mutation (Figure 7D and 7F) (t-test p = 0.1032, approaching statistical significance given the small sample size). These results support the hypothesis that the tp53 mutation rescues the fancl female-to-male sex reversal phenotype by decreasing the number of apoptotic germ cells, thereby counteracting the abnormally high frequency of apoptotic germ cells observed in fancl homozygous mutants. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that the fancl mutation causes the female-to-male sex reversal phenotype by increasing germ cell apoptosis during a critical time for sex determination.Despite the broad use of zebrafish as a model for vertebrate development, its sex determination mechanism remains poorly understood. In this work, we characterize a zebrafish fancl mutation that causes homozygotes to develop exclusively as fertile males due to female-to-male sex reversal. We show that an increase of germ cell apoptosis in mutants compromises the survival of oocytes undergoing meiosis, which may imply an alteration of the signaling between germ cells and somatic cells of the gonads, masculinization of gonads to form testes, and the development of a male phenotype. We show that the mutant sex reversal phenotype can be rescued by reducing Tp53-mediated apoptosis, which allows oocyte survival, and suggests a pivotal role of germ cell apoptosis in zebrafish sex determination. Extending these results from fancl mutants to wild-type zebrafish, we propose a model in which genetic and environmental sex determining factors act to increase or decrease germ cell apoptosis and oocyte survival and thus alters the strength of a hypothetical oocyte-derived signal that maintains expression of female genes in somatic cells and hence determines sex in zebrafish.Fancl protein helps mediate cellular responses to a variety of stresses, especially DNA damage and apoptosis [36]. Mutations in human FANCL lead to Fanconi Anemia (FA) [39], a disease of bone marrow failure, enormous risks of cancer, and hypogonadism and impaired fertility (reviewed in [38]). Likewise, the most consistent FA phenotype in murine FA gene knockout models (e.g. Fancc, Fancg, Fanca, Fancd1, Fancd2), is hypogonadism, impaired gametogenesis and infertility (reviewed in [56]). Our work shows that the disruption of fancl in zebrafish causes homozygous mutants to develop exclusively as males due to female-to-male sex reversal rather than female-specific lethality. This is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, that a mutation in a Fanconi gene can cause female-to-male sex reversal.Our work revealed expression of fancl in germ cells during zebrafish gonad differentiation, which is consistent with a role of Fancl in germ cell development. Other species, such as mouse, also express fancl in their germ cells [57], [58], suggesting a conserved role of Fancl in vertebrate germ cell development. Previous work had shown exclusive male development in zebrafish lacking germ cells due to total loss-of-function of dead end, nanos, ziwi, or zili [31]–[34], [59]. We demonstrate here, however, that germ cells are present throughout the entire life in all individuals homozygous for the fancl mutation, which rules out the possibility that male development in fancl mutants that otherwise would have become females is due to lack of germ cells. Work presented here shows specifically that the mere presence of germ cells is insufficient to feminize gonads, but rather, it suggests that oocytes passing through meiosis are essential to support differentiation of ovaries. Our results are in agreement with previous suggestions that zili mutants all become phenotypic males probably due to the lack of oocytes at week 4 during the window of sex determination rather than due to the total loss of germ cells at week 8 [59]. Homozygous fancl mutants, in which germ cells are always present, provide a useful tool to better understand the role of germ cell-soma signaling that tips gonad fate towards the male pathway.Comparison of sex-specific gonadal markers among fancl mutants, WT controls and dnd-MO animals, which lack germ cells, reveals that the onset of expression of the female marker cyp19a1a and the early male marker amh in individual undifferentiated gonads at 19 dpf is similar in all genotypes. This result supports the conclusion that the onset of early somatic makers is independent of germ cell signaling [31]. These results also show that undifferentiated gonads of fancl mutants initially develop as normal bipotential “juvenile ovaries” containing oocytes at early stage IB with no obvious histological differences from gonads of WT controls.During the critical time-window for sex determination in zebrafish (e.g. 26 dpf), however, fancl mutant gonads become morphologically different from wild-type gonads. Wild-type animals have perinucleolar oocytes that progress through meiosis from early stage IB to late stage IB with obvious lampbrush chromosomes, indicating that recombination is complete and oocytes are at the diplotene stage of meiosis I, in which homologous chromosomes begin to separate but remain attached at chiasmata [51]. In contrast to wild types, most fancl mutants lack late stage IB oocytes, indicating that oocytes fail to progress beyond pachytene stage, when recombination occurs, and do not enter diplotene. Our results show that the levels of fancl transcripts are regulated during the process of gametogenesis because fancl expression up-regulates in oocytes transitioning from early to late stage IB (Figure 3I). Consistent with this result, a large-scale gene expression profiling study of developing ovaries in trout found fancl in a group of many genes that were over-expressed when the first oocyte meioses were observed [60]. In fancl zebrafish mutants, the failure of oocytes to transition from early to late stage IB suggests that Fancl might promote the successful progression of oocytes through meiosis I or the survival of meiotic oocytes. The FA pathway is apparently involved in meiosis because in mouse, Fanca is expressed in pachytene spermatocytes and Fanca knockout mice have elevated rates of mis-paired meiotic chromosomes and increased germ cell apoptosis [37]. Whether this effect on meiosis depends on the known role of FA proteins in homologous recombination in somatic cells [61] or some other aspect of meiosis is as yet unknown.The failure of oocytes to progress through meiosis in fancl mutants correlates with the observation that most mutant gonads do not express the female somatic marker cyp19a1a, but instead up-regulate the male somatic marker amh. Interestingly, we found a few fancl mutants with some late stage IB oocytes accompanied by expression of cyp19a1a, but also showing high expression levels of amh; we interpret these animals as females whose progress towards ovary development was being derailed due to the mutation of fancl. These results would be expected if oocytes are essential to maintain cyp19a1a expression.We hypothesize that in juvenile fancl mutants, the absence of oocytes progressing through meiosis alters oocyte signaling to the soma that maintains the female program. Without this signal, somatic cells do not maintain the expression of cyp19a1a, do not suppress amh expression, and as a result, gonads do not become ovaries but instead become masculinized and form testes. It is likely that this signal arising from meiotic oocytes is essential for somatic pre-granulosa cyp19a1a-expressing cells to proliferate and to differentiate as mature granulosa cells. In mammals, it has been suggested that meiotic oocytes reinforce ovarian fate by antagonizing the testis pathway [62], [63]. Studies on gonadal somatic cell lineages in mice and medaka, have shown that granulosa cells of the ovary and Sertoli cells of the testis develop from a common precursor [64]–[66]. It is possible that mammalian meiotic oocytes reinforce the ovarian pathway by preventing granulosa cells from trans-differentiating into Sertoli-like cells, because the loss of oocytes in mammals induces maturing follicular cells (or pre-granulosa cells) to acquire Sertoli-like cells characteristics [67]. We hypothesize that the action of meiotic oocytes in preventing pre-granulosa cells from trans-differentiating into Sertoli-like cells is an ancestral function that has been conserved in mammals and fishes. Although our experiments do not address the question of whether somatic cells trans-differentiate in fancl mutant gonads, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that fancl mutants, which lack oocytes at the diplotene stage of meiosis, can not prevent the trans-differentiation of pre-granulosa cyp19a1a-expressing cells into Sertoli-like amh-expressing cells. This hypothesized mechanism could explain the disappearance of cyp19a1a-expressing cells and the maintenance and proliferation of amh-expressing cells in fancl mutant gonads that results in gonad masculinization. Future transcription profiling analyses comparing wild-type animals and fancl mutants lacking oocytes will help to identify genes involved in oocyte-soma signaling essential for ovary development.We observed that the loss of oocytes in fancl mutants during the time-window of sex determination (25 dpf) is accompanied by an abnormal increase of Caspase-3-mediated apoptosis of germ cells compared to wild-type siblings. This result suggests the hypothesis that the disappearance of meiotic oocytes in fancl mutants is due to an increase in germ cell apoptosis, which provides a cellular mechanism for the female-to-male sex reversal phenotype of fancl mutants. To test this hypothesis, we suppressed cell death in fancl mutants by making them homozygous for a tp53 mutation. We show that the reduction of apoptosis in fancl−/−;tp53−/− double mutants is sufficient to promote the survival of developing oocytes and to rescue the female-to-male sex reversal phenotype of fancl mutants. Our result showing that only fancl−/−;tp53−/− double mutants developed any females, while their fancl−/−;tp53+/− and fancl−/−;tp53+/+ sibling controls developed exclusively as males, indicates that the amount of germ cell apoptosis alters sex determination in fancl mutants.The double mutant experiments further show that Tp53 activity mediates increased apoptosis associated with the fancl mutation. Doubly homozygous fancl−/−;tp53−/− rescued females were fertile and developed normal ovaries full of oocytes maturing through all stages of oogenesis. Active Caspase-3 results show that the amount of germ cell apoptosis is lower in double homozygous fancl−/−;tp53−/− individuals than in their fancl−/−;tp53+/+ mutant sibling controls, which further supports the hypothesis that the abnormal increase of apoptosis in fancl mutants that compromises the survival of meiotic oocytes is the mechanism responsible for the female-to-male sex reversal.We did not notice a sex ratio biased towards females in the tp53M214K mutant line. This allele, however, is hypomorphic, and may possess levels of apoptosis compatible with the male pathway. This conclusion is supported by our finding that a few fancl−/−;tp53−/− double mutants developed as males. An alternative explanation is that mechanisms of apoptosis independent of Tp53 might occur in male gonads that promote oocytes to disappear in developing testes.Our finding of increased germ cell apoptosis in fancl zebrafish mutants is consistent with the increase of apoptosis in a variety of cell types reported in Fanconi Anemia knockout mice. For instance, Fanca−/−, Fancc−/−, and Fancg−/− knockout mice show increased apoptosis of hematopoietic or neuronal cells, which might lead to a progressive loss of stem and progenitor cells [68]–[70]. Bone marrow failure in children with Fanconi Anemia is attributed to excessive apoptosis and subsequent failure of the hematopoietic stem cell compartment (reviewed in [56]). Interestingly, Fanca−/− knockout mice also show increased male germ cell apoptosis [37], suggesting that a role of the FA network related to apoptosis of germ cells might be a conserved feature in fish and mammals. Young Fancl−/− knockout mice, in contrast to fancl mutant zebrafish, do not show sex reversal but initially develop as sterile males and sterile females. Fancl−/− knockout male mice – but significantly, not Fancl−/− knockout female mice – can recover fertility and become fertile adult males. These results suggest that Fancl is necessary for germ cell proliferation in mouse embryos and for the maturation of oocytes, but not for the proliferation or maturation of spermatogonia in adulthood [58]. In zebrafish, the fact that fancl mutant males are fertile and that fancl−/−;tp53−/− rescued females are also fertile indicates that Fancl function is not essential for the maturation of zebrafish spermatogonia and oogonia to become sperm or mature oocytes, but rather that Fancl function affects specifically germ cell survival.The loss of oocytes progressing through meiosis in fancl mutants suggests that Fancl function is involved in the survival of developing germ cells through meiosis, and that when Fancl is mutated, developing oocytes cannot survive due to an inappropriate increase of Tp53-dependent germ cell apoptosis. This idea is consistent with the fact that genetic deletion of Tp53 can rescue the TNF-alpha dependent apoptosis caused by accumulation of the pro-apoptotic protein kinase PKR resulting from a mutation of the human FANCC gene [68], reviewed in [56]. Therefore, inappropriate activation of Tp53-dependent apoptosis might be a common mechanism affecting cell survival in both zebrafish and human after alteration of the FA network. Given the fundamental similarity of the cellular mechanisms of the FA pathway in zebrafish and humans, the screening of small molecule libraries for compounds that can rescue the sex-reversal phenotype of zebrafish fancl mutants might identify compounds of therapeutic importance for Fanconi Anemia patients.Our analysis of zebrafish fancl mutants suggests a model in which oocyte survival regulated by Tp53-mediated apoptosis is a central element that can tip gonad fate towards the male or the female pathway (gradient red box in Figure 8). Zebrafish develop initially as juvenile hermaphrodites, and have immature ovaries during the juvenile stage regardless of their definitive sex [26]–[28]. This immature ovary is bipotential, and expresses both female (cyp19a1a) and male (amh) specific markers (Figure 8A) [29], [31], [48]. During the fate decision period, some wild-type animals up-regulate cyp19a1a and suppress amh expression (Figure 8B) thereby tipping the fate of the gonad towards the female ovarian pathway (Figure 8C). Complementarily, other wild-type individuals suppress cyp19a1a and up-regulate amh expression (Figure 8D) and gonad fate tips towards the male testis pathway (Figure 8E). In this work, we show that oocyte survival is crucial to maintain the female gene expression profile of somatic cells that is essential for ovary development.This model suggests germ cell apoptosis as a central feature that can integrate genetic and environmental factors to tip the fate of the gonad towards the female or the male pathway and thus determine zebrafish sex. (A) Zebrafish juveniles initially develop an undifferentiated bipotential immature ovary regardless of their eventual definitive sex. The juvenile gonad contains developing oocytes (shown in yellow), as well as somatic cells that express female-specific markers like cyp19a1a (purple) and early male-specific markers like amh (green). This model suggests that different levels of germ cell apoptosis (indicated as a red gradient box from low (white) to high apoptosis (red)) has the potential to tip the fate of the gonad: high apoptosis (e.g fancl−/− mutants) tips fate towards the male pathway, while low apoptosis (e.g. fancl−/− tp53−/− mutants) tips fate towards the female pathway and rescues the sex-reversal phenotype of fancl mutants. In this model, wild-type zebrafish can enter the male pathway at different times during the fate decision time-window (dashed arrows in apoptosis box) ([30] and this work), which is probably related to the level of apoptosis that affects oocyte survival in each particular individual. (B) Analysis of somatic markers reported here shows that the survival of oocytes during the fate decision time-window is crucial to maintain and increase expression of cyp19a1a in the somatic cells of the gonad (B, purple gradient) and to down-regulate the expression of amh in the somatic cells of the gonad (B, green gradient), perhaps due to an oocyte-derived signal, which in fancl mutants would be compromised. (C) This gene expression profile feminizes the gonad, oocytes continue to develop, the gonad differentiates as an ovary, and the individual becomes a female. (D) In the absence of oocytes during sex fate decision time, as in fancl mutants, gonads do not maintain cyp19a1a (D, purple gradient), but instead up-regulate amh expression (D, green gradient). (E) This gene expression profile masculinizes the gonad, which differentiates as a mature testis and the individual becomes a male. (F,G) The absence of surviving oocytes in fancl−/− mutants is probably due to high levels of germ cell apoptosis, which causes all animals to develop as males due to female-to-male sex reversal. This sex reversal phenotype can be rescued by decreasing germ cell apoptosis in double homozygous fancl−/−;tp53−/− mutants. Therefore, our analysis of fancl mutants provides evidence supporting the model that the survival of developing oocytes through meiosis, and not the mere presence of germ cells, is a critical factor that tips the fate of the gonad towards the female pathway in zebrafish. (H) Other work has shown that environmental factors such as high temperature can also induce oocyte apoptosis and tip the fate of the gonads towards the male pathway [71]. In light of this analysis, our model suggests that sex-determining mechanisms in zebrafish integrate signals from genetic and environmental factors that can modify the levels of Tp53-mediated germ cell apoptosis, which influence oocyte survival during the period of gonad fate decision, and tip the fate of the gonad towards the female or the male pathway, thus determining the sex of zebrafish.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001034.g008In wild-type zebrafish, juvenile bipotential gonads contain immature oocytes at early stage IB ([49]; and this work). In transitional stages, gonads that become ovaries possess oocytes that progress through meiosis to late stage IB and reach diplotene, where they arrest for the remainder of oocyte development [49]. In fancl−/− homozygous mutants, loss of oocytes at or before diplotene likely alters signaling from germ line to the soma, leading to loss of cyp19a1a expression, failure to down regulate amh expression, and consequent masculinization of the gonads to form testes (Figure 8G). The cyp19a1a gene encodes aromatase, the enzyme that converts testosterone to estrogen. It is known that aromatase is critical for female fate in zebrafish because pharmacological treatments with the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole masculinizes gonads [71]–[73] and because, complementarily, treatments with estrogen (estradiol) down-regulate amh expression and feminize the gonad [74]. We hypothesize that the apoptotic loss of oocytes in fancl mutants causes cyp19a1a gene expression to disappear and leads to the failure to maintain aromatase levels, which results in failure to produce and sustain high estrogen levels in the gonad, causing gonads to abandon the female fate and instead, enter the testis developmental program.The presence of oocytes appears to be important for sex determination not only for zebrafish, but also for medaka. In contrast to zebrafish, in which all individuals begin oogenesis, in medaka only XX females start oogenesis while XY males suppress oogenesis and all germ cells remain undifferentiated (reviewed in [75]). A feature common to both species is that the number of developing oocytes is a key feature that tips undifferentiated gonads towards an ovary fate ([31], [75] and this work). In medaka, the partial removal of PGCs can reduce the number of developing oocytes below a threshold necessary for female development [76]. In addition, medaka hotei mutants, which have aberrant oocyte development [77], fail to maintain cyp19a1a expression and gonads develop into testes. Therefore, the survival of developing oocytes appears to be important for sex determination in both zebrafish and medaka. These considerations support the hypothesis that when the number of oocytes exceeds a threshold, sexual fate tips towards the female pathway, and alternatively, when the oocyte number fails to exceed that threshold, the sexual fate tips towards the male pathway, as we observed in zebrafish fancl mutants.In zebrafish, presumptive juvenile males had more TUNEL signal in germ cells than presumptive females had suggesting the hypothesis that oocyte apoptosis could be the mechanism of testicular and ovarian differentiation in zebrafish [27]. Consistent with this hypothesis, analysis of ziwi null mutants showed that total loss of germ cells by apoptosis caused ziwi mutants to develop exclusively as sterile males [34]. Our results show that Tp53-mediated germ cell apoptosis is a mechanism that can tip gonad fate towards the female or male pathway, at least in fancl mutants. Because environmental factors such as high temperature (Figure 8H) or endocrine-disrupting chemical treatments can also increase oocyte apoptosis and cause sex reversal [71]–[73], it is plausible to suggest that the integration of genetic and environmental factors converge to modify the levels of Tp53-mediated germ cell apoptosis, which affect oocyte survival during the critical time window to determine the sexual fate of the gonad, and ultimately alter zebrafish sex determination.Animals were handled in accordance with good animal practice as defined by relevant animal welfare bodies, and the University of Oregon Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal work (Animal Welfare Assurance Number A-3009-01, IACUC protocol #08-13).The zebrafish fancl mutation (HG10A; GenBank accession AB353980) was generated by insertional mutagenesis by Tol2 transposon-mediated enhancer trap [42]. The tp53 mutant line tp53zdf1 causing the amino acid substitution M214K was obtained from ZIRC (http://zebrafish.org/zirc/home/guide.php) [55]. Genotyping of tp53 animals was performed as described [55]. Genetic nomenclature follows guidelines from ZFIN (http://zfin.org/zf_info/nomen.html).The full-length zebrafish fancl cDNA was previously described [44] (GenBank accession AY968598). Primer pairs used to amplify the fancl wild-type or mutant alleles were: WT_F:CTGGTCTTTATTGACTGTAATGGC; WT_R:TAGATAAGCTCCAGATTTGGCTTG; Mutant_F:GTCAGCCCATCCAGATCAGCAG; Mutant_R:CATGACGTCACTTCCAAAGGACC. PCR conditions were: 5′94°C; 32 cycles of: 30″94°C, 30″55°C, 1′72°C; followed by 10′72°C. Sizes of PCR-amplified bands: Wild type: 479 bp; Mutant: 370 bp.Total RNA isolation from dissected adult testes and cDNA synthesis were performed as described [41]. Primers used for reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) experiments were: F1:GACGGCTTCATCACAGTGCTG; R1:CATGACGTCACTTCCAAAGGACC; F2:GAACCCTGACTGCACTGTCCTAC; R2:GCTTTGGCGACTGGTTGGCAGAC. PCR conditions were: F1-R1: 3′94°C; 40 cycles of: 30″94°C, 30″58°C, 1′30″72°C; followed by 10′72°C; F2-R2: 3′94°C; 37 cycles of: 20″94°C, 30″60°C, 45″72°C; followed by 10′72°C. Sizes of PCR-amplified bands: F1-R1: 1239 bp F2-R2: 232 bp.To obtain animals lacking germ cells, wild-type zebrafish embryos from the AB strain were injected at the 1–2 cell stage with antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (Gene Tools, Oregon) directed against dead end as described [46]. Sibling non-injected embryos and a fraction of dnd MO-injected embryos were fixed at 24 hours post-fertilization to confirm the presence or absence of germ cells by whole-mount in situ hybridization using vasa probe as described [47].Animals were reared and collected under standard conditions [78]. In situ hybridization experiments on zebrafish cryosections were performed as described [29]. Adjacent sections of gonads were obtained by placing three consecutive sections of the gonad on three different slides. Probes for amh and cyp19a1a were made as described [29] and probe for vasa was made from its 3′end as described [47]. A fancl cDNA fragment of 786 nt containing the PHD domain (nucleotides 646-1431 of AY968598) was cloned in TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and used to synthesize DIG-labeled riboprobe (Boehringer Mannheim). For gonad histology, euthanized animals were fixed in Bouin's fixative for about 24–48 hours and washed repeatedly in 70% ethanol. Animals were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 7 microns, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.Animals were fixed at 25 dpf in 4% PFA ON at 4°C, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 7 microns. Apoptotic cells were detected by immuno-fluorescence using anti-active Caspase-3 as primary antibody (1∶200, BD Pharmingen) and Alexa-Fluor594 goat anti-rabbit as secondary antibody (1∶1000, Invitrogen) following an immuno-histochemical protocol (S. Cheesman, personal communication). Gonads were screened for positive signal by DIC-fluorescence microscopy. The number of positive cells in gonads of fancl and wild-type animals was scored in 840 sections: 70 sections containing gonads per each animal (n = 12).We thank T. Titus and Y.

In this study, a novel cDNA has been screened from a subtractive cDNA library between tail bud embryos and blastula embryos in the protogynous hermaphrodite orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides). Its full-length cDNA is 821 bp, and has an ORF of 414 bp for encoding a peptide of 137 aa, which shows 38%, 37%, 33%, and 33% homology with 4 putative proteins screened from zebrafish (Danio rerio). Conserved domain search in NCBI reveals a single C2 domain existing in the C2 domain superfamily proteins, and has only 7 β strands in comparison with 8 β strands of C2 domains in other C2 domain superfamily proteins. Artificial sex reversal, RT-PCR analysis and Western blot detection demonstrated ovary-specific expression of the C2 domain factor, and therefore the novel gene was designated as E. coioides ovary-specific C2 domain factor, EcOC2 factor. Moreover, predominant expression of EcOC2 factor was further revealed in grouper mature ovary, and its strong immunofluorescence signals were located between granulosa cells and oocyte zona radiata in grouper mature follicles. The data indicate that the novel EcOC2 factor might be a main component that associates between granulosa cells and the oocyte during oocyte maturation, and might play significant roles in regulating oocyte maturation and ovulation. Further studies on its developmental behaviour and physiological functions will elucidate the interactions between oocyte and the surrounding somatic cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

This is usually determined genetically; however it is a delicate process, which in many cases can be influenced by environmental factors. The mechanisms controlling zebrafish sex determination and differentiation are not known. To date no sex linked genes have been identified in zebrafish and no sex chromosomes have been identified. However, a number of genes, as presented here, have been linked to the process of sex determination or differentiation in zebrafish. The zebrafish FTZ-F1 genes are of central interest as they are involved in regulating interrenal development and thereby steroid biosynthesis, as well as that they show expression patterns congruent with reproductive tissue differentiation and function. Zebrafish can be sex reversed by exposure to estrogens, suggesting that the estrogen levels are crucial during sex differentiation. The Cyp19 gene product aromatase converts testosterone into 17 beta-estradiol, and when inhibited leads to male to female sex reversal. FTZ-F1 genes are strongly linked to steroid biosynthesis and the regulatory region of Cyp19 contains binding sites for FTZ-F1 genes, further linking FTZ-F1 to this process. The role of FTZ-F1 and other candidates for zebrafish sex determination and differentiation is in focus of this review.Among mammals sex is usually defined by the presence or absence of the sex specific chromosome Y. In many, but not all, fish species there is also a chromosomal background to sex determination. Several fishes, including most salmonids, have heterogametic males and homogametic females, similar to the mammalian XY/XX-system [1–3]. Other species, such as Poecilia, have homogametic males and heterogametic females (ZZ/ZW), which also is the case for birds [4]. Some species of the Poecilid platyfish Xiphophorus, utilize a system with three sex chromosomes [5]. In yet other species sex determination is influenced by environmental factors such as the temperature surrounding the developing embryo [6–8]. Hermaphroditism is also a common feature of several fish species. Several studies have shown that species with genetic sex determination can be directed to produce genetically sex-reversed offspring. This is accomplished either by treating the fish with hormones, which can induce sex reversal in synchronous hermaphroditic fish [9, 10] and masculinization/feminization in gonochoristic species, or by incubating embryos in certain temperatures or pH [11]. The proportion of males usually increases with temperature whereas lower temperatures favour females. In the case of pH, species differences have been observed.There are few studies of sex determination in fish and the genetic mechanisms behind sex determination in fish remain largely unknown. Environmental factors, including endocrine disrupters such as diethylstilbestrol, PCBs or dioxins, can affect both teleost and mammalian reproductive systems, but do not seem to alter sex ratios or cause sex reversals in mammals. This indicates that mammalian sex determination is more strictly genetic, and shows less gonad plasticity than teleosts. However, it has been observed that a number of genes, both sex-linked and autosomal, display dosage effects in mammals (Table 1), suggesting that allelic variants could account for differences in gene function.While the developmental mechanisms by which the mammalian gonads are formed have been thoroughly studied and several genes involved have been identified, only a few of these genes have been identified in fish. The functions of these genes have not been fully elucidated in fish and both conserved and divergent functions between mammals and fish have been suggested. As zebrafish is an important vertebrate model for developmental biology it is vital that the basic developmental mechanisms of sex determination are further studied in this species. In the present review we discuss the roles of genes involved in sex determination with a focus on the potential role of FTZ-F1 genes in zebrafish sex determination and differentiation. From the present knowledge of these genes in zebrafish we attempt to present a model for zebrafish sex determination and differentiation.There is a close anatomical relationship between the development of the genital ridge and the excretory system during early ontogeny of all vertebrates, including fish. A mesodermal layer ventral to the somites differentiates into structures involved in excretion and reproduction. There are species differences in how closely connected these structures are in regard to sharing ducts for secretion [20]. The teleost gonads are similar to those in mammals. The testis contains Sertoli and Leydig cells in addition to germ cells, and the ovary consists of thecal cells and granulosa cells surrounding the ovum. In both teleosts and mammals the interstitial cells (Leydig and theca), Sertoli cells and granulosa cells are of the same origin. An important difference is that the mammalian gonads are terminally developed into either testis or ovary, while fish gonads often retain the ability to change, making them sequential hermaphrodites [21]. Immature teleost gonads can be directed to develop into testes or ovaries, regardless of chromosomal background, by hormone treatment [22, 11]. Far too few fish species have been studied with regard to gonad development to be able to develop a general model of how this occurs.The zebrafish has become a useful vertebrate model system and is probably the most studied fish in developmental biology. The zebrafish diploid genome consists of 50 chromosomes and no specific sex chromosomes have been identified. The use of synaptonemal complex studies rather indicates that no sex chromosomes exist in zebrafish [23, 24]. Teleosts have a partially duplicated genome, which in zebrafish has been determined by studying HOX-clusters [25], and this further complicates the elucidation of potential sex linked genes. In theory, there may be smaller genomic differences that account for or direct the development toward two separate sexes. By studying patterns of inheritance, zebrafish have been suggested to have XY-like chromosomal background [26]. However, the opposite system, with heterogametic females in zebrafish has also been suggested [27]. The inconsistency of results regarding sex chromosomes in zebrafish suggests that the sex determining system is labile and that no clear sex determining chromosome exist. The zebrafish is sexually mature after approximately three months, but separate sexes can be detected after 21–23 days post fertilization (dpf) [26]. Prior to sex differentiation all zebrafish develop ovary-like gonads, regardless of chromosomal background. Ovarian development is the default pathway, which is initiated after 10 dpf and progress until 20 dpf. At 21 dpf until approximately 30 dpf testis development is initiated in males simultaneously with ovarian apoptosis.The gonad development in zebrafish begins during embryogenesis. Using Vasa as a marker gene, germ cells can be detected in the area ventral to the third to fifth somite at the six-somite stage [28]. While germ cells can be detected earlier, they are not properly positioned until around the 6 somite stage. So far no studies have been made regarding markers for gonadal steroidogenic precursor cells, rendering it difficult to know exactly where these cells are located in the embryo. But, it is likely that these cells derive from an area close to where Vasa is detected at the six-somite stage. The zebrafish Wilms Tumour-1 (WT1) is also initially detected in an area corresponding to that of Vasa but is later expressed in the pronephric ducts [29], making this region probable for the development of the rest of the zebrafish gonadal cells.In zebrafish, little information exists regarding sex determination and the potential presence of sex chromosomes. To date, no sex-linked genes have been identified. However, a number of genes, as presented here, have been linked to the process of sex determination or differentiation in zebrafish. Since none of the genes have been shown to be sex-linked, it is not likely that any of the below listed genes is the single factor responsible for specifying sex in zebrafish. Still, the expression patterns and regulatory mechanisms of these genes leads to the conclusion that they are part of a signalling network responsible for the development of sex specific gonads. In line with observations on mammals (Table 1) gene dosage effects may be a factor involved in zebrafish sex determination. Since no sex-linked genes have been found in zebrafish, allelic variants and dosage effects of autosomal genes, such as the Fushi Tarazu factor-1 (FTZ-F1) genes, SRY HMG box related gene 9 (Sox9), WT-1, Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH), doublesex-mab 3 related gene (Dmrt1) and GATA4 (a zinc finger transcription factor) may be involved in determining sex and directing gonad development. The dosage dependent region on X (Dax-1) is highly involved in female sex determination in mammals, but no dax-1 gene homologue has so far been identified in zebrafish. The Dax-1 gene has however been identified in the Nile Tilapia [30], suggesting that other fish species may also have Dax-1 homologues.Even when sex determination in teleost fish has a genetic background, they lack an equivalent to the testis-determining factor SRY found in mammals. However, several HMG-box containing genes, Sox-genes, have been identified in fish [31–33]. In zebrafish, two Sox9 genes, termed Sox9a and Sox9b, have been identified. Both contain the HMG-box and are able to bind the AACAAAG recognition site in a similar manner as murine Sox9 [34]. The expression patterns of Sox9a and b are dissimilar in adult zebrafish. Sox9a displays a broad expression pattern and has been found in brain, kidney, muscle, testis and pectoral fin, whereas Sox9b is only found in ovary. During embryogenesis Sox9a and b are both expressed in cells involved in craniofacial development and in the brain [34]. In addition Sox9a has been shown to be essential for chondrogenic development [35] and Sox9b has been implicated to be involved in neural crest development [36]. Whether Sox9a and/or b are involved in sex determination or differentiation has so far not been studied. However, an HMG-Box cis element has been identified in gene promoter of fushi tarazu factor 1a (ff1a) [37]. Sox9a is also able to specifically bind this site in vitro (von Hofsten et al., unpublished) indicating that a regulatory connection between Sox9a and ff1a is present in zebrafish. Zebrafish embryos homozygous for jellyfish (jef) (mutations in sox9a) show craniofacial defects and lack of cartilage similar to humans with campomelic dysplasia [35]. The jef strain is still able to reproduce, which leads to the conclusion that Sox9a alone does not direct sex determination and differentiation in zebrafish.AMH may not be excluded as a factor involved in the sex determining process in zebrafish. Although fish lack Müllerian ducts, other AMH functions may be important for gonad development. In mammals AMH is, in addition to Müllerian degeneration, involved in regulation of gonadal steroidogenesis. AMH inhibits the expression of aromatase in developing gonads [38]. It also negatively modulates the differentiation and function of Leydig cells [39] by down regulating several enzymes involved in the steroidogenic pathway. Ovarian cell growth is inhibited by AMH in vitro [40]. An AMH related gene, eel spermatogenesis related substances 21 (eSRS21) identified in the Japanese eel is mainly expressed in Sertoli cells and down regulates 11 KT induced spermatogenesis. This indicates that eSRS21 and genes related to AMH have important reproductive functions and are involved in sex determination and differentiation in fish [41]. In zebrafish, we recently cloned an AMH cDNA and observed that it was expressed exclusively in gonads [42]. AMH expression was, by in situ hybridization, found predominantly in Sertoli cells in testis and in the follicular layer in ovaries. Interestingly, AMH is co-expressed both with the Steroidogenic Factor-1 (SF-1) homologue ff1d and Sox9a within these cells [42, 43]. AMH displays complex regulation in mammals, involving several factors, including the FTZ-F1 related gene SF-1, GATA4, Sox9 and WT1 [44, 45]. The transcriptional regulation of zebrafish AMH has so far not been elucidated. However, the AMH gene promoter sequence contains putative binding sites for the same transcription factors that regulate mammalian AMH, indicating a conserved regulatory mechanism in vertebrates.As in mammals, the anlagen for the excretion and reproductive systems both derive from intermediate mesoderm [46–48]. WT1 was originally found to be a suppressor of Wilms tumour, as individuals with inactivated WT1 developed the Wilms tumour condition [49]. WT1 is also a crucial factor in the differentiation of renal tissue. In zebrafish, WT1 has been shown to be expressed in the intermediate mesoderm prior to and during renal tissue differentiation [29]. It is also essential for the steroidogenic interrenal development together with ff1b [50]. WT1 is thereby an important factor in the early events during development of gonadal primordium.The Drosophila homeobox gene fushi tarazu (ftz) was initially identified as a central factor for segmentation, as inhibition of ftz resulted in the development of fewer segments [51, 52]. The fushi tarazu factor-1 (FTZ-F1) was later identified as the key regulator of ftz expression [53, 54]. Genes homologous to the Drosophila FTZ-F1 have subsequently been identified in several species in different phyla [55–63]. Several different names have been given to these homologues, including steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), adrenal-4-binding protein (Ad4BP), embryonal long terminal repeat-binding protein (ELP), α-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) and liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1). However, lately a nomenclature system presented by the nuclear receptor committee groups the FTZ-F1 homologues under the name NR5A [64].The mammalian genome contains two FTZ-F1 homologues (NR5A1 and NR5A2). NR5A1 contains the SF-1 related genes, which are closely connected to steroidogenesis. In mammals, the NR5A1 genes are expressed in steroidogenic tissues, are key regulators of steroidogenesis and are involved in the testis determining pathway during sex determination [65–67]. The NR5A2 genes are linked to regulation of the estrogen-binding α-fetoprotein [60]. The mammalian NR5A2 genes are expressed in steroidogenic tissues as well as liver, pancreas and intestine, but appear to be more involved in cholesterol metabolism than steroid synthesis or sex determination.FTZ-F1 homologues have been identified in a number of teleost species [55–57, 68–70]. Several teleosts have multiple variants of FTZ-F1 genes. The roles and functions of these genes are not completely elucidated, but all studies conducted so far indicate an involvement in the reproductive axis or in steroidogenesis. The ff1 proteins share the general structure of other nuclear receptors. They contain a DNA binding domain (DBD) with two Zn-fingers and the FTZ-F1 box for DNA interaction and recognition, a hinge domain that connects to the ligand-binding domain (LBD), which contains the I-box for protein-protein interaction and the activator function-2 (AF-2) domain for transcriptional activation (Fig. 1). Zebrafish is the most extensively studied teleost and four FTZ-F1 genes have been identified (ff1a, b, c and d). The arrangement of FTZ-F1 genes into the nuclear receptor 5A subgroups is a suitable system for genes in higher vertebrates, as no indistinguishable genes have been described so far in these animals. However, teleosts and particularly zebrafish are different in more than one way compared to higher vertebrates. Zebrafish have four different FTZ-F1 genes, whereas mammals and higher vertebrates only possess two. The zebrafish genes are not easily arranged within the NR5A subgroups. Zebrafish ff1a and Arctic char ff1 aligns well within the NR5A2 subgroup (Fig. 2), but their expression patterns and suggested functions do not fit the description of the mammalian NR5A2 genes. The zebrafish ff1c does not align well with any of the described subgroups, which further raises the question of how appropriate the subdivisions really are for teleost FTZ-F1. Ff1d and ff1b are similar and aligns together with medaka FTZ-F1 in a subgroup within the NR5A1 clade. This subgroup has previously been named NR5A4, but recent data indicates that the genes in the NR5A4 subgroup are NR5A1 homologous. Recently it was suggested that ff1b and ff1d are of the same origin and arose from ancestral gene duplication [71]. This was supported by the overlapping expression patterns found in embryonic interrenal and pituitary cells [42]. The tissue distribution of ff1b and ff1d is identical, while it differs from ff1a and ff1c (Fig. 3). The combined information of ff1b and ff1d expression patterns, function and sequence similarities to other genes in the NR5A1 group suggest that these genes should be considered as homologues.General structure of zebrafish FTZ-F1 proteins. The zebrafish FTZ-F1 proteins consist of four main regions, the modulator domain, DNA-binding domain (DBD), hinge region and the ligand-binding domain. The DBD contains a Zink-finger region, an A- and P-box for recognition of the FTZ-F1 response element, and a T-box for stabilising the DNA-binding. The proximal repressive- and interactive domains (PRD and PID) are used for interactions with co-repressors and co-activators. The ligand binding-domain containing the I-box and AF-2 region, which both are involved in ligand binding and transactivation, and a distal repressive domain (DRD) for co-repressor binding.NR5A sequence similarity analysis displayed in a radial tree.

Modified from [42].Tissue distribution of ff1a, ff1b, ff1c and ff1d in adult zebrafish, detected by RT-PCR. The four ff1 genes show differential expression with the ff1a gene being expressed in most tissues with high expression in liver. The ff1b and ff1d genes are both expressed in gonads and brain with the ff1d showing higher expression in testis than in ovary. The ff1c gene is primarily expressed in the liver. m: male tissue, f: female tissue. Modified from [42].The first FTZ-F1 gene described in zebrafish was ff1a [55]. The gene was named zff1, as no other zebrafish ff1 genes were known at that time. With the identification of additional ff1 genes it was later renamed ff1a. The gene possesses two splicing variants, now designated ff1a-A and ff1a-B. Ff1a-A was, in synergy with ER, shown to transcriptionally activate a gonadotropin promoter, whereas ff1a-B acted as an inhibitor of ff1a-A due to its lack of the AF-2 trans-activation domain. The expression of zebrafish ff1a was later shown to be driven by two separate gene promoters, giving rise to a total of four separate gene transcripts, ff1a-IA, ff1a-IB, ff1a-IIA and ff1aIIB [72].The functional difference between ff1a proteins consisting of exon one, transcribed via promoter I, and proteins transcribed from promoter II has so far not been studied. However, they differ slightly in their tissue distribution, where promoter I derived transcripts are lacking in brain and heart [72]. The two ff1a promoters contain different putative response elements [37, 72]. This suggests that the two promoters regulate ff1a in tissue specific manners and during different developmental stages rather than rendering them separate functions. Also mouse and rat have two separately regulated NR5A promoters [65, 73].Two of the putative response elements in promoter I indicate an involvement in somitogenesis. MyoD and Snail are both transcription factors shown to be involved in somite development [74, 75], indicating that promoter I may drive the ff1a expression during somitogenesis. The ff1a IIA gene product is involved in muscle differentiation during somitogenesis. Microinjection of ff1a AII mRNA into the ubo-mutant strain, which lack slow-twitch muscle cells, results in partially restored myofibers [76]. Promoter II contains an HMG-Box response element 24–31 bp up stream of the transcription start. An identical response element has been shown to bind Sox9a in vitro [34] and Sox9 is hence a putative regulator of gonadal expression of ff1a. Expression of ff1a can be detected in the uro-genital and pronephric duct region during early somitogenesis [77] and by linking the ff1a dual promoter to GFP, early gonadal expression can be detected 5 dpf after microinjection [37]. This indicates a role in early gonad development and differentiation. The Arctic char ff1 homologue has been linked to steroidogenesis by showing a cyclic expression pattern during the reproductive maturation process and 17β-estradiol mediated down-regulation of testicular expression [56]. The phylogenetic relationship indicates that the Arctic char ff1 belongs to the ff1a related genes and should be named ff1a (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the developmental expression pattern of Arctic char ff1a is similar to zebrafish ff1a [78], indicating that teleost ff1a homologues are involved both in steroidogenesis and gonad development.The ff1b gene was initially assigned to functions related to pancreatic development as it was co-expressed with pancreas duodenum homeobox-1 (pdx-1) and proinsulin [56]. However, more recent publications suggest that ff1b is an important factor for steroidogenic cell development and that ff1b is required for the differentiation of the interrenal organ [79, 80]. The expression of ff1b precedes that of cyp11A and 3βHSD in the embryonic interrenal cells and ff1b morpholino knock down experiments abolishes the expression of these two genes [79].The down stream transcriptional activation function of ff1b is modulated by protein-protein interactions with homeodomain protein Prox1 [80]. Two domains are needed for the interaction, the I-box and the AF-2 domain, both situated in the LBD. Binding to Prox1 leads to a repression of down stream trans-activation. There is also a co-localization of ff1b and Prox1 expression in the developing interrenal. Due to the conserved I-boxes and AF-2 domains, both ff1a and ff1c are probably able to interact with Prox1, although less efficiently than ff1b.There is little information available regarding ff1c functions, regulation or expression patterns. Except for a weak interaction between Prox1 and ff1c presented in Liu et al. [80], the sequence published on GenBank, (AF327373) is the only published data available so far. Expression of ff1c can be detected in numerous tissues in adult zebrafish and its highest expression is found in liver and intestine, indicating a role in cholesterol metabolism, similar to ff1a (see Fig. 3). No specific ff1c expression domains have been identified during embryogenesis. Both ff1c and ff1d are similar to ff1a and b in their DNA-binding domains where the FTZ-F1 box is situated and in the ligand binding domains, but are less conserved in their hinge regions. All zebrafish ff1 have highly conserved AF-2 domains and I-Boxes in their LBD.Ff1b and ff1d display an overlapping expression pattern during embryogenesis. They share protein domains important for co-factor interactions and have been suggested to be the result of an ancestral gene duplication [42, 71]. Even though the two zebrafish NR5A1 genes are similar in several aspects, the shared sequence identities are 62%, which suggests that functional differences are likely to exist. Expression of ff1d in adult zebrafish is restricted to brain, gonads and liver [42]. There also seem to be sexual differences, as ff1d expression is higher in testis than in ovary. In the testis ff1d is highly expressed in interstitial Leydig cells and Sertoli cells, but cannot be detected in germ cells. In ovary ff1d is located to the follicular layer and inside the oocyte [42]. Although the function and regulatory mechanisms of ff1d in these cells needs to be further studied, a possible target of ff1d is AMH, which is co-expressed with ff1d in Sertoli cells and in the follicular layer. During mammalian sex determination and differentiation, the ff1d homolog SF-1 regulates the expression of AMH, leading to the development of male sex characteristics. Therefore it is intriguing that this may be a conserved vertebrate developmental mechanism.The lack of testis-determining factor similar to SRY in fish is not a unique phenomenon. This is also the case for many other lower vertebrates. Genes containing a DM-domain (Dmrt1) have however been identified in fish. DM-domain containing genes are involved in sex determination in both vertebrates and invertebrates [81], which is a unique conservation of function between phyla, not seen in any other gene involved in sex determination. Different Dmrt1 homologues have been shown to be involved in gonad development [82, 83] and somitogenesis [84].The teleost Japanese medaka has specific sex chromosomes (XX/XY), where the DM-domain gene DMY has been mapped to the Y-chromosome and has been shown to be essential for testis differentiation [85, 86]. This was determined by isolating the sex-determining region on the male specific Y-chromosome. Except for the DMY-containing region, the X and Y-chromosomes are very similar. This indicates that the medaka Y-chromosome and DMY are, in an evolutionary prospective, relatively new. This theory was later confirmed and DMY was discarded as a universal teleost sex-determining gene, as it was shown to be a species-specific sex-determining strategy [87]. No target genes for DMY have been identified and DMY function in testis development remains unresolved. Treating birds with the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole lead to elevated Dmrt1 levels indicating that Dmrt1 may be down regulated by aromatase [88]. This indicates that Dmrt1 may have an important role in testis determination in teleosts, since alteration of aromatase levels during sex differentiation can cause sex reversals. The regulation of Dmrt1 related genes in teleosts remains unknown, but testicular expression of Dmrt1 is in mammals regulated by GATA4 [89].GATA factors are divided into two families based on expression patterns, structure, and function [90]. GATA-1/2/3 is most commonly associated with haematopoietic cell and neuronal development [91, 92]. GATA-4/5/6 are usually linked to organ development, including the urogenital system [93, 94]. GATA factors recognize and bind the DNA consensus motif, WGATAR, and closely related sequences. GATA-4 plays an important role as transcriptional regulator of SRY and AMH during mammalian sex determination and differentiation [95]. Studies of zebrafish GATA factors have so far been associated with the development of organ systems other than the urogenital, but binding sites for GATA4 have been found in the cyp19 gene promoter [96, 97] suggesting a role in regulating aromatase expression.Steroidogenesis, sex determination and differentiation are closely related to each other. SF-1 is one of the crucial factors essential for steroid biosynthesis as well as sex determination and differentiation in mammals. The terminal sex-hormone products in the steroid biosynthesis pathway are androgens and estrogens, and the balance between them leads to the development of proper sex characteristics. Aromatase (Cyp 19) is the product of the cyp19 gene, and is an important regulator of this balance. Aromatase is produced in the gonads and directs the conversion of testosterone into 17β-estradiol.Like many other fish species, the zebrafish genome contain two aromatase genes designated cyp19a and cyp19b [98]. Cyp19a is highly expressed in the steroidogenic Theca and granulosa cell layer surrounding the oocytes in the ovary, whereas cyp19b is mainly expressed in brain. Thus, while one aromatase gene appears to be involved in gonadal development the other gene may be involved in neuronal development. However, both genes contribute to the regulation of estrogenic responses and may thus influence sex differentiation. The regulation of teleost cyp19 transcription is not completely elucidated, but the zebrafish cyp19a promoter region contains binding sites for Ftz-F1, which suggests a role for ff1 genes in the regulation of cyp19a expression in gonadal tissue [97, 99]. Ftz-F1 dependent cyp19 transcription has also been documented in species from turtles to humans [100–102], indicating that this mechanism is conserved in all vertebrates. In many vertebrates, reptiles in particular, the level or activity of aromatase is the deciding factor for sex during development [103, 104]. The temperature surrounding the developing embryos influences the activity of aromatase leading to variations in sex ratio [105]. A similar scenario has been documented for several fish species, including zebrafish, suggesting that aromatase is an important factor in sex determination and differentiation in fish. By using an aromatase inhibitor, or by increasing water temperature to 35°C–37°C, oocyte apoptosis can be induced in zebrafish [106]. However, during normal breeding conditions the temperature is not an important factor deciding sex ratios in zebrafish. The role of aromatase remains important in zebrafish sex determination as exposure to the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole results in sex-reversion of female zebrafish [106].Studies of mammals have shown that genes involved in sex determination have multiple functions but that the presence of the SRY gene in animals with XY/XX chromosomal systems leads to male development. As discussed earlier in this review many of the genes involved in mammalian sex determination show dosage dependent effects on sex determination and differentiation. A generalised genetic regulatory pathway can be extracted from the studies conducted on different vertebrate species (Fig. 4). Most identified genes have a primary function in male development. The regulatory pathway includes, and is based on, the presence of SRY and Dax-1, which in an antagonistic manner direct the development of male and female phenotypes in mammals. Lack of the SRY gene, as is the case in teleosts, suggest that when chromosomal sex determination exist it must be regulated by alternative genes. In medaka the Dmrt1 gene was found to be the switch. However, this role for Dmrt1 is specific for medaka and it remains that any of the other known genes in the sex determination cascade could potentially develop into the genetic switch in other teleost species. Or, there may be yet unidentified genes and pathways that participate in teleost sex determination.Involvement of a hierarchy of genes in mammalian sex determination and differentiation. In XY/XX systems where SRY is the key regulator of sex determination its absence leads to activation of Dax1 and female development. The presence of SRY results in a hierarchy of activation of genes leading to the development of testis. In this hierarchy SF-1 (FTZ-F1) is a key regulator of steroidogenesis and AMH, demonstrating its central role in sex determination and differentiation. ⊥: Inhibition, ↓: stimulation.From the information obtained to date it is not possible to define a hierarchy of regulation during sex determination in teleosts. Therefore, the proposed model for zebrafish sex determination is based on the same group of male determining genes, excluding SRY and Dax-1, found in mammals while the interplay between the genes remains undefined (Fig. 5). Theoretically, any one of the described genes may become the sex determining gene, as several of them have been shown to cause sex reversals in mammalian model systems in a dosage dependent way (see table 1). The male determining switch may also be dependent on combinatory effects of allelic variants among the genes involved. Furthermore, the regulation of aromatase appears to be crucial for zebrafish sex determination.A generalized model of the involvement of different genes in zebrafish sex determination and differentiation. While little is known of the hierarchy of genes involved in zebrafish sex determination and differentiation several genes have been identified. While aromatase has been shown to play a central role in zebrafish sex differentiation the environmental and/or genetic mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. ⊥: Inhibition, ↓: stimulation.The model suggests that ff1a and WT1 are important for the differentiation of the uro-genital tissue, which subsequently develops into renal and gonadal tissue. WT1 is essential for the differentiation of pronephros, and a battery of genes, including the FTZ-F1 genes, Sox9a, GATA4, Dmrt1 and AMH, are involved in the differentiation of gonads. During the critical time period around 25 dpf this battery of genes may direct the development towards male gonads in individuals with the allelic combinations predestined to become male. This would lead to a decrease or absence of aromatase and subsequent reduced estrogen levels and activity, resulting in the onset of ovarian apoptosis, the differentiation of testicular Sertoli cells and increased testosterone levels. The model is based on the observation that adult female zebrafish can be sex-reversed by inhibiting aromatase [106]. This suggests that zebrafish has a high plasticity in their mechanism of gender development and that steroidogenesis plays an essential part in the sex determining process. The complex mechanism of sex determination and differentiation is still far from elucidated and the biochemistry behind it must be further studied to establish protein interactions controlling it. The FTZ-F1 genes are important, as they are involved in the early development of uro-genital tissue and as regulators of steroidogenic cells and their gene expression.Thorgaard GH: Heteromorphic sex chromosomes in male rainbow trout.

It contains 913 nucleotides with an open reading frame encoding 146 amino acids with a 20 amino acid signal peptide. The grouper mature TSHβ has 75, 70, 61, 59, 41, 42 and 40% identities to that of rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon, zebrafish, European eel, chicken, mouse and human, respectively. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the TSHβ mRNA was expressed abundantly not only in pituitary but also in gonads. A more interesting finding is to reveal the differential TSHβ expressions between the ovaries and the transitional gonads or testes in natural individuals of orange-spotted grouper and red-spotted grouper Epinephelus akaara, and in artificial sex reversal individuals of red-spotted grouper induced by MT feeding. In situ hybridization localization provided direct evidence that the TSHβ was transcribed in the germ cells. In the growing oocytes, the TSHβ transcripts were concentrated on the ooplasm periphery. In testicular tissues, the intensively expressed TSHβ cells were found to be spermatogonia and spermatocytes in the spermatogenic cysts. This is the first report of a TSHβ expressed in the gonads of any vertebrates in addition to the expected expression in the pituitary, and it expresses more transcripts in the gonads during sex reversal or testis than in the ovaries both in E. coioides and E. akaara. Importantly, the TSHβ identification in germ cells allows us to further investigate the functional roles and the molecular mechanisms in gametogenesis of groupers, especially in sex reversal and in spermatogenesis.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

The percentage of gonadal masculinization in the genetic all-females at 40 days post-hatching, treated with 0, 10, 100 and 1000 μg fadrozole g−1 diet−1 were 0, 62.5, 100 and 100%, respectively. Rearing at high water temperature in genetic all-females was performed at 15–25 days post-hatching. The percentage of gonadal masculinization in the genetic all-females at 40 days post-hatching, at water temperatures of 28.5, 35 and 37 °C were 0, 68.8 and 100%, respectively. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive oocytes of early diplotene and perinucleolar stages in fadrozole-treated genetic females (1000 μg g−1 diet−1) were observed at 15–40 days post-hatching during sex-reversal. In contrast, apoptotic oocytes of early diplotene stage in high temperature-treated genetic females (at 35 and 37 °C) during sex-reversal and presumptive males of wild-type fish during sex differentiation were found at 15–27 days post-hatching. Our findings indicate that oocyte apoptosis, depletion of P450arom activity and differentiation of spermatogonia during gonadal sex-reversal are caused by treatments of aromatase inhibitor or high water temperature.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

ScienceDirect ® is a registered trademark of Elsevier B.V.ScienceDirect ® is a registered trademark of Elsevier B.V.Author affiliationsComplex developmental mechanisms of vertebrates are unraveled using comparative genomic approaches. Several teleosts, such as zebrafish, medaka and pufferfish, are used as genetic model systems because they are amenable to studies of gene function. The rice field eel, a freshwater fish, is emerging as a specific model system for studies of vertebrate sexual development because of its small genome size and naturally occurring sex reversal. Data presented here support the use of the rice field eel as another important fish model for comparative genome studies, especially in vertebrate sexual development. This model system is complementary rather than redundant.   © 2003 S. Karger AG, BaselReceived: May 12, 2003

Karger AG, BaselIn a partial life-cycle test, the impact of 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and 17α-methyltestosterone (MT) on juvenile zebrafish was evaluated by use of vitellogenin measurements and gonadal development. Exposure to EE2 (1–25 ng/l) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in vitellogenin production starting at 2 ng/l. Significant changes in sex ratios in female direction were detected at 1 ng/l, with complete sex reversal taking place after exposure to 2 ng/l. No intersex fish were observed after exposure to EE2. Exposure to MT resulted in decreased vitellogenin concentrations. Complete sex reversal was detected in all MT concentrations used (26–1000 ng/l). A large proportion of intersex fish was observed after exposure to 1000 ng MT/l. The period of gonadal sex reversal in non-exposed zebrafish was also studied. The main morphological features of the transformation of ovaries into testis were observed 4–5 weeks after hatching.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

ScienceDirect ® is a registered trademark of Elsevier B.V.ScienceDirect ® is a registered trademark of Elsevier B.V.Author affiliationsThe first vertebrate master sex-determining gene different from Sry has been very recently discovered in a small aquarium fish, the medaka (Oryzias latipes). In this fish, the X and Y chromosomes apparently differ only by a 250-kb Y-specific region containing dmrt1bY (also called DMY and dmrt1Y), a male-specific copy of the autosomal gene dmrt1. Dmrt1 is a putative transcription factor probably involved in testis formation in different vertebrate lineages. Dmrt1bY is the only gene having escaped the drastic process of degeneration that devastated the small Y-specific region of the medaka. Mutations leading to truncation or lower expression of dmrt1bY result in XY male-to-female sex reversal. Hence, both genetic and functional evidences converge in making dmrt1bY an outstanding candidate for the function of a master sex-determining gene in fish. Nevertheless, dmrt1bY could not be detected in certain other Oryzias species or in more divergent fishes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the duplication of the autosomal dmrt1 that formed dmrt1bY is young in evolutionary terms. Hence, dmrt1bY is not the universal master sex-determining gene in fish. Because the classical fish models, such as zebrafish and pufferfish, are not very adequate to study the basis of genetic sex determination, alternative models, such as the platyfish (Xiphophorus maculatus), are re-emerging. In this fish, which is a well-suited laboratory organism, gene loci involved in pigmentation, melanoma formation, and sexual maturity have been mapped close to the master sex-determining gene. Interestingly, the platyfish can harbor three different sex chromosomes (W, X, and Y) in certain natural populations. Bacterial artificial chromosome contigs covering the sex-determining region of the platyfish are already available, and the positional cloning of the master sex-determining gene(s) should provide new insights into sex determination and sex chromosome evolution in fish and other vertebrates.   © 2002 S.

Karger AG, BaselTo determine the critical stage of zebrafish development where exposure to xenoestrogens can affect sex ratio and vitellogenin induction, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to 17α-ethinylestradiol (actual concentration 15.4±1.4 ng EE2/l) during early development: from fertilisation to hatch; hatch to 10 days post hatch (dph); 10–20 dph; 20–30 dph; 20–40 dph; 20–60 dph; fertilisation to 25 dph; or hatch to 60 dph. Vitellogenin was measured in whole body homogenate 30 dph by ELISA and sex ratio was determined 60 dph by histological examination of the gonads. All exposure periods significantly induced vitellogenin synthesis and affected the sex differentiation leading to development of ovo-testis or complete feminisation of the exposed fish depending on exposure period. Complete sex reversal was obtained in groups exposed from 20 to 60 dph and hatch to 60 dph. The half-life for degradation of vitellogenin was calculated. Juvenile zebrafish were exposed to 15.4±1.4 ng EE2/l (actual concentration) from fertilisation to 25 dph and transferred to clean water, after which weekly measurements of vitellogenin concentration in whole body homogenate were performed until day 46 post hatch. The half-life of vitellogenin was 2.4 days.We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Earlier studies in zebrafish led to the identification of two homologues of mammalian sox9, sox9a and sox9b. The present study represents the first evaluation of expression patterns of zebrafish sox9b during early embryogenesis. Our analyses reveal that sox9b transcripts are present throughout the life-cycle of the zebrafish, but exhibit tissue-specific distribution during embryogenesis. Zygotic expression of sox9b occurs in the anterolateral margins and the midline of the prospective dorsal neuroectoderm during late gastrulation. During early segmentation, the transcript is expressed in pairs of longitudinal bands in the prospective midbrain, hindbrain, and trunk, which identify the cranial and trunk neural crest progenitors. Neural crest cells cease expression of sox9b during migration, but some of their derivatives resume sox9b expression. Sox9b can serve as a marker for neural crest precursors.This is a preview of subscription content, log in to check access.Department of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, Protein Science Laboratory of the Ministry of Education, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, ChinaMing Li, Chengtian Zhao, Ying Wang, Zhixing Zhao & Anming MengElectronic PublicationReprints and PermissionsLi, M., Zhao, C., Wang, Y. et al.

View our privacy policyGenes related to the Drosophila melanogaster doublesex and Caenorhabditis elegans mab-3 genes are conserved in human. They are identified by a DNA-binding homology motif, the DM domain, and constitute a gene family (DMRTs). Unlike the invertebrate genes, whose role in the sex-determination process is essentially understood, the function of the different vertebrate DMRT genes is not as clear. Evidence has accumulated for the involvement of DMRT1 in male sex determination and differentiation. DMRT2 (known as terra in zebrafish) seems to be a critical factor for somitogenesis. To contribute to a better understanding of the function of this important gene family, we have analyzed DMRT1, DMRT2, and DMRT3 from the genome model organism Fugu rubripes and the medakafish, a complementary model organism for genetics and functional studies. We found conservation of synteny of human chromosome 9 in F. rubripes and an identical gene cluster organization of the DMRTs in both fish. Although expression analysis and gene linkage mapping in medaka exclude a function for any of the three genes in the primary step of male sex determination, comparison of F. rubripes and human sequences uncovered three putative regulatory regions that might have a role in more downstream events of sex determination and human XY sex reversal.To whom correspondence and reprint requests should be addressed.

At present almost 30 Sox genes have been identified. Members of this family have been shown to be conserved during evolution and to play key roles during animal development. Some are involved in human diseases, including sex reversal. Here we report the isolation of a novel member of the Sox gene family, Sox30, which may constitute a distinct subgroup of this family. Using a bacterially expressed DNA-binding domain of Sox30, we show that it is able to specifically recognize the ACAAT motif. Furthermore, Sox30 is capable of activating transcription from a synthetic promoter containing the ACAAT motif. The specific expression of Sox30 in normal testes, but not in maturing germ cell-deficient testes, suggests the involvement of Sox30 in differentiation of male germ cells. Mapping analyses revealed that the Sox30 gene is located on human chromosome 5 (5q33) and on mouse chromosome 11.The high mobility group (HMG) box was originally identified in the RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF as a region of homology to the HMG-1 protein ( 1 ). This motif consists of ∼80 amino acid residues and binds to the minor groove of DNA, resulting in the induction of a dramatic bend within the DNA. HMG box-containing proteins can be classified into two major groups based on the degree of sequence specificity of the DNA binding and the number of HMG boxes within a protein.One group includes UBF, HMG-1 and MT-TF1, which have multiple HMG boxes and recognize DNA with low or no sequence specificity. The other group includes LEF-1, STE-11 and Sox proteins, which possess a single HMG box and show sequence-specific DNA binding ( 2 , 3 ). The Sox (SRY-related HMG box) family proteins are defined by a HMG box which shows >50% sequence similarity with the founding member of this group, mouse Sry. At present almost 30 members have been reported which can be classified into seven subgroups based on their structural similarity ( 4 , 5 ). In addition to the DNA bending activity of the HMG box, several Sox proteins, such as Sox4, Sox9, Soxl7, Soxl8 and Sox24, have been shown to activate transcription via their own activation domains ( 6–11 ).The Sox genes are conserved during evolution and have been found to play key roles in decisions of cell fate during diverse developmental processes ( 4 ). The first demonstration of this concept came from the cloning of SRY , the gene responsible for human sex reversal ( 12–15 ). Shortly thereafter, regulation of male development by expression of Sry was clearly demonstrated in karyotypic female mice carrying the mouse Sry gene ( 16 ). Other members of the Sox family, Sox9 and Sox10, have been shown to be associated with the skeletal malformation syndrome campomelic dysplasia and one cause of Waarden-burg-Hirschsprung disease, respectively ( 17–22 ). Drosophila Sox gene Dichaete (fishhook) is involved in segmentation and central nervous system development ( 23 –26) and COG -2, a Sox gene in Caenorhabditis elegans is required to establish a functional vulval-uterine connection ( 27 ). In vertebrates, Sox5, Sox6 and Sox9 cooperatively regulate chondrogenesis whereas Sox4 is involved in B cell and endocardial ridge differentiation ( 28 , 29 ). Xenopus homologs of Soxl7 ate involved in endoderm differentiation in embryos ( 30 ). Some Sox genes, including Sox5 and Soxl7, ate differentially expressed during spermatogenesis and thus are believed to regulate differentiation of male germ cells ( 9 , 31 ).Sox proteins are known to activate transcription syner-gistically with other transcription factors. In lens differentiation, several Sox proteins seem to require the presence of another lens factor in order to regulate transcription of the 81-crystallin gene ( 32–34 ). Sox2 is also involved in the regulation of FGF-4 transcription via protein-protein interaction with Oct-3 ( 35 , 36 ). This Sox-Oct interaction has also been implicated in glial cell differentiation and seems to be conserved during evolution ( 26 , 37 , 39 ). Sox9 and steroidgenic factor-1 (SF-1) also synergistically activate the anti-Mullerian hormone gene whose product is crucial for proper male sexual differentiation ( 39 ).Here we report the identification of a novel member of the Sox gene family, Sox30, which is exclusively expressed in testis. Sequence and biochemical analyses indicate that the Sox30 gene encodes a sequence-specific transcriptional activator which is relatively divergent from other Sox proteins. The germ cell-specific expression of Sox30 implicates its involvement during spermatogenesis.pLexA-WT1 (+/+), a bait for yeast two-hybrid screening, was constructed by inserting the Sac II- Pst I fragment of pRcCMV-WT1(+/+) containing the WT1 coding sequence (a gift from T. Akiyama) into pBTM116. pRN3myc was generated by inserting a synthesized oligonucleotide containing a myc tag sequence, initiation ATG and Xho I site into pRN3 (a gift from P. Lemaire and J.B. Gurdon) ( 40 ). For plasmid vectors used in in vitro transcription and expression in mammalian cells, the sequence surrounding the initiation ATG in the human Sox30 cDNA was mutated to a Sal I site using Kunkel's method ( 41 ). pRN3myc-Sox30 was generated by cloning the Sal I- Not I fragment containing the coding sequence of human Sox30 into pRN3myc. Mammalian expression vectors were constructed by cloning the Sal I- Not I fragment into pME18S-mycII or pME18S-FlagII which carries the SRα promoter (a gift from J. Inoue). For reporter gene assay, one, four or eight copies of Sox30 binding sequence were inserted upstream of dN-luc, which contains an enhancerless promoter of human T cell leukemia virus type 1. The oligonucleotides used were 5′-GGGGAGACAATGGGACAAT-GGCGAGACAATGGGA-CAAT-3′ and 5′-CCCATTGTCCCATTGTCTCGCCATTGT-CCCATTGTCTC-3′. A reporter plasmid containing one copy of the Sox30 binding site was isolated by insertion of a partial oligonucleotide, GAGACAATGGGACAGGG. A glutathione S -transferase (GST) fused Sox30 expression vector was constructed by inserting the 362 bp Eco RI- Sfi I fragment of ml25-31 cDNA into pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting construct encodes a GST fusion of 121 amino acid residues of mouse Sox30 which does not show significant homology with any other proteins. This fusion protein was bacterially expressed, purified using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then used for immunization of rabbits and subsequent production of Sox30-specific antiserum.Yeast strain L40 was transformed with pLexA-WTl(+/+) and subsequently with a Gal4 activation domain-fused mouse testis cDNA library. A total of 3 × 10 6 clones were screened and four clones were found to interact specifically with WT1 in yeast. The insert of one clone, ml25, was used to screen a human testis 5′-stretch cDNA library (Clontech). The sequences of both strands were determined with an automated DNA sequencer 373A (PE Applied Biosystems) and analyzed by the Genetyx-Mac (Software Development Co., Japan) and Clustal X multiple sequence alignment programs.Interspecific backcross progeny were generated by mating (C57BL/6J × Mus spretus ) F 1 females and C57BL/6J males as described ( 42 ). A total of 205 N 2 mice were used to map the Sox30 locus (see text for details). The probes and RFLPs for the loci linked to Sox30 , including Adrala and Il3 , have been reported previously ( 43 ). Recombination distances were calculated using Map Manager v.2.6.5. Gene order was determined by minimizing the number of recombination events required to explain the allele distribution patterns.Poly(A) + RNA was isolated from organs of adult mice using Isogen (Nippongene, Japan) and Oligotex-dT30 (Takara Bio-medicals). Poly(A)+ RNAs (2 (xg) or total RNAs (5 or 10 ng) were electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels containing 2.2 M formaldehyde and subjected to blot hybridization.RNA was isolated from embryonic tissues and treated with DNase I. cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Gibco BRL). PCR reactions were carried out in 20 μl containing cDNA prepared from 10 ng of RNA with primer pairs for mouse Sox30 or Hprt. Sox30 primers were 5′-CGGTTCTCCTTTCATCACCC-3′ and 5′-CCAAGGCTCCA-ATGTCCAGA-3′. Hprt primers were 5′-CCTGCTGGATTA-CATTAAAGCACTG-3′ and 5′-GTCAAGGGCATATCCAA-CAACAAAC-3′. Cycle conditions for amplification of Sox30 were: 95°C for 9 min; 35 or 38 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 57°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min; 72°C for 10 min. Cycle conditions for amplification of Hprt were: 95°C for 9 min; 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 59°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min; 72°C for 10 min. These conditions were optimized for AmpliTaq Gold (PE Applied Biosystems). In the initial experiments, cycles were changed from 25 to 40 to determine the appropriate number of cycles for semi-quantitative PCR.According to Inaba et al. ( 44 ), binding sequences for GST-Sox30 were selected from a pool of random DNA sequences with a modified binding buffer [10 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.7, 60 mM KC1, 1 mM EDTA, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 0.1%NP-40, 5% glycerol, 0.16 mg/ml BSA, 0.16 mg/ml poly(dG-dC)poly(dG-dC)]. In a parallel experiment, GST and GST-SRY were also used as controls. The random sequence library was prepared by PCR amplification of CGCGGATC-CTGCAGCTCGAG(A/G/C/T) 30 GTCGACAAGCTTCTAG-AGCA with primers of the first and last 20 bases. After six repetitions of selection/amplification, amplified DNAs were digested with Bam HI and Hind III and cloned into pBluescript SK(-). Individual clones were sequenced and aligned.Full-length Sox30 protein was prepared using mMESSAGE mMACHINE (Ambion) and the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The oligonucleotides used were: wt sense, 5′-GGGGCTAAACTGAGGGTAACAATGGTCATT-3′; wt anti-sense, 5′-CTAGAATGACCATTGTTACCCTCAGTTTAG-3′: mu sense, 5′-GGGGCTAAACTGAGGGTAGTGGCGGTC-ATT-3′; mu antisense, 5′-CTAGAATGACCGCCACTACCCT-CAGTTTAG-3′. Fifteen nanograms of annealed wild-type fragment were end-labeled with [γ- 32 P]ATP. For EMSA, 3 μl of programmed reticulocyte lysate and end-labeled probe (30 000 c.p.m.) were incubated in 15 μl of binding buffer [10 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.7, 60 mM KC1, 1 mM DTT, 12%glycerol, 0.16 mg/ml BSA and 0.16 mg/ml poly(dG-dC)-poly(dG-dC)] on ice for 30 min. Samples of 3 |Al were resolved on a non-denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel (acryl-amide:bisacrylamide 30:1) in 0.5× Tris/borate/EDTA buffer at room temperature. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR film for 4 days with an intensifying screen at -70°C.CV-1 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method with 2 μg of reporter plasmid and 5 (μg of expression vector. Sonicated salmon testis DNA was added to adjust the total amount of DNA to 15 μg. Two days later, cell extracts were prepared using Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Promega). The luciferase activities were measured with a Berthold Lumat luminometer, LB9501. Values were normalized for protein concentration using Bio-Rad Protein Assay reagent (Bio-Rad).Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts corresponding to the same number of cells were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto Immobilon (Millipore) as previously described ( 45 ). Tagged Sox30 protein was detected with anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (Kodak) and an ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).During the screening and characterization of cDNAs encoding WT1 (Wilms' tumor suppressor gene)-associated proteins by yeast two-hybrid screening, we isolated a clone, ml25, from a mouse testis cDNA library which seemed to encode a novel HMG box-containing protein. We subsequently screened a human testis cDNA library using this murine cDNA and obtained overlapping clones, hl25-13 and hl25-17, which appeared to contain the entire coding sequence. Another cDNA clone, hl25-15, revealed the possibility of alternative splicing in this gene. Further screening and RT-PCR analysis confirmed that two types (types I and II) of hl25 mRNAs exist in humans, encoding polypeptides of 753 and 501 amino acid residues, respectively ( Fig. 1A ). Sequence analysis of the genomic structure of hl25 revealed that exon skipping occurs in type II, resulting in a frameshift (data not shown). The hl25 HMG box showed <50% similarity to the HMG boxes of other Sox proteins and no significant homology was found outside the HMG box. We therefore concluded that hl25 is a novel member of the Sox gene family and termed this gene Sox30. To date, the classification of Sox genes into seven groups is based upon the structural resemblance of the HMG boxes within a subgroup (over 75% similarity) ( 2 , 4 , 5 , 46 ). This suggests that Sox30 constitutes a novel subgroup within the Sox gene family. Alignment of the coding sequences confirmed that Sox30 is distantly related to other Sox genes ( Fig. 1B ).To investigate whether Sox30 may be involved in any known diseases or mutations, the chromosomal localizations of human and mouse Sox30 were determined. For mouse, interspecific backcross analysis with progeny derived from matings of (C57BL/6J × M.spretus ) F 1 × C57BL/6J mice was utilized. The interspecific backcross mapping panel has been typed for over 2400 loci that are distributed among all autosomes as well as the X chromosome ( 42 ). C57BL/6J and M.spretus DNAs were digested with several enzymes and analyzed by Southern blot hybridization of informative restriction fragment length polymorphisms using a mouse Sox30 cDNA probe. Fragments of 7.9 and 4.6 kb were detected in Eco RV-digested C57BL/6J DNA and fragments of 7.2 and 4.1 kb were detected in EcoRV- digested M.spretus DNA. Thus, the 7.2 and 4.1 kb EcoRY M.spretus RFLPs were used to follow segregation of the Sox30 locus in backcross mice (data not shown). The mapping results indicated that Sox30 is located in the central region of mouse chromosome 11 linked to Adrala and Il3. A total of 114 mice were analyzed for all markers as shown in the segregation analysis; however, up to 167 mice were typed for specific pairs of markers. Each locus was analyzed in pairwise combinations for recombination frequencies using the additional data. The ratios of the total number of mice exhibiting recombinant chromosomes to the total number of mice were determined for each pair of loci and the most likely gene order is as follows: centromere-Adrala-2/l67- Sox30-8/l21-Il3. The recombination frequencies (expressed as genetic distances in cM ± SE) are - Adrala -1.2 ± 0.8- Sox30 -63 ± 2.2- Il3 ( Fig. 2A ).The chromosomal localization of the human Sox30 gene was determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization using human Sox30 cDNA as a probe ( 47 ). In more than 50 cells analyzed, the only site of specific fluorescent signal (>15%) was observed on 5q33 ( Fig. 2B ). The 5q region of the human chromosome has been shown to share homology with the central region of mouse chromosome 11. Therefore, the human chromosomal location of Sox30 is consistent with that of the mouse.The expression of Sox30 was first analyzed by northern blot hybridization using mouse tissue RNAs. A 3 kb transcript was observed only with testis RNA ( Fig. 3A ). A testis-restricted pattern of expression was also seen using human multiple tissue cDNA panels (Clontech; data not shown). No expression of Sox30 was observed in placenta, thymus, colon or peripheral blood leukocytes in humans. Sox30 transcripts were scarcely detectable in testes of mice aged 0-4 and 8 days. The level of expression increased significantly by 16 days after birth and continued to increase thereafter. No transcripts were detected in either artificial cryptorchid or jsd/jsd mouse testes ( Fig. 3B ). Up until post-natal day 8, mouse germ cells are still at the stage of spermatogonia with no differentiating cells present. After that, primary spermatocytes appear and reach an early pachtene stage by day 14 ( 48 ). In artificial cryptorchid testes and in jsd/jsd mouse testes, only type A spermatogonia and Sertoli cells are found in seminiferous tubules due to the inability of type A spermatogonia to differentiate ( 49 ). These results suggested that Sox30 is specifically expressed in male germ cells and that the increase in its expression may correlate with the later stage of pachtene spermatocytes in which meiosis occurs.Structure of a novel member of the Sox family, Sox30. (A) Schematic illustration of the human Sox30 proteins. Two splice variants, types I and II, were identified by cDNA screening and RT-PCR. The N-terminal regions and the HMG box (indicated by a shaded box) are identical. The C-terminal sequences differ due to a frameshift (see text). The nucleotide sequences of Sox30 have been submitted to the DDBJ, EMBL and GenBank databases with accession nos. AB022083 (type I) and AB022441 (type II). (B) Phylogenetic tree of the Sox family. Multiple alignment was performed by means of Clustal X (v. 1.64b from ftp://ftp-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/ClustalX/). The phylogenetic tree was drawn using njplot, included in the software package Clustal X. Full-length amino acid sequences of human (h) and mouse (m) Sox proteins were compared. Mouse sequences were used when the human orthologous sequences were not available. Note that Cremazy et al. ( 5 ) categorized Sox20 into subgroup B2 because of its significant similarity with Sox proteins in group B.Chromosomal assignment of the Sox30 gene. (A) Chromosomal mapping of mouse Sox30. The segregation patterns of Sox30 and flanking genes in 114 backcross animals typed for all loci are shown at the top of the figure. Each column represents the chromosome identified in the backcross progeny that was inherited from the (C57BL/6J × M.spretus ) F l parent. The shaded box represents the presence of a C57BL/6J allele and white boxes represent the presence of a M.spretus allele. The number of offspring inheriting each type of chromosome is listed at the bottom of each column. A partial chromosome 11 linkage map showing the location of Sox30 in relation to linked genes is shown at the bottom of the figure. Recombination distances between loci in cM are shown to the left of the chromosome and the positions of loci in human chromosomes are shown to the right. (B) Chromosomal mapping of human Sox30. Metaphase chromosomes were stained with a propidium iodide-labeled human Sox30 cDNA probe. Twin spot signals on the long arm of chromosome 5 are indicated by arrows (left). The G-banding patterns of the same chromosomes are also shown (right).Expression of Sox30 mRNA. (A) Expression in adult mouse tissues. Aliquots of 2 μg of poly(A) + RNAs were subjected to blot hybridization. Bars indicate mobility of molecular weight markers of 7.46, 4.40, 2.37 and 1.35 kb (RNA Ladder; Gibco BRL). The arrow indicates the mouse Sox30 transcript. The autoradiogram was exposed for 5 h with an intensifying screen at -70°C. (B) Expression in normal and mutant mouse testis. Sox30 expression was analyzed during male germ cell development (left) and in maturing germ cell-deficient testes (right). Aliquots of 10 (left) or 5 μg (right) of total RNAs were subjected to blot hybridization, respectively. The autoradiogram was exposed for 15 h with an intensifying screen at -70°C. (C) Expression in mouse embryonic tissues. Total RNAs from embryonic tissues were subjected to reverse transcription. Separate PCR reactions were performed using primer pairs for Sox30 (upper) or Hprt (lower). Cycles were 35 except for the right panel of Sox30 (38 cycles). M, male; F, female.Subcellular localization of type I and type II Sox30 proteins. The amount of Flag-tagged Sox30 protein in nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts was determined by immunoblotting using anti-Flag antibodies. Nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic (C) extracts loaded on the gel are from the same number of cells.We also analyzed the expression of Sox30 in 10.5 and 13.5 d.p.c. embryos by RT-PCR ( Fig. 3C ). Sox30 transcripts could be detected in embryonic testis, kidney (mesonephros and metanephros), brain, lung, heart and stomach at 13.5 d.p.c. and in the whole embryo at 10.5 d.p.c. However, the level of expression was considerably lower compared with that observed in neonatal testis at 0-4 days (see also Fig. 3B ).We characterized the biochemical properties of Sox30 protein and found that, similarly to other Sox proteins, Sox30 protein is exclusively localized in cell nuclei, as shown by western blotting analysis ( Fig. 4 ). Next we tested whether Sox30 exhibits sequence-specific DNA binding. After incubation of random oligonucleotides with GST-Sox30 fusion protein, oligonucleotides which bound to GST-Sox30 were collected by glutathione-Sepharose beads. After initial amplification of the selected oligonucleotides by PCR, this binding and collection step was repeated. The selection process was repeated six times and subsequently the amplified oligonucleotides were cloned and sequenced. An ACAAT sequence was observed in all of the sequenced clones ( Table 1 ). In parallel experiments, use of GST-SRY resulted in the amplification of an AACAAT motif, consistent with previous reports (data not shown; 50). In contrast to other Sox members, Sox30 appears to prefer a guanine residue surrounding the core ACAAT motif ( 9 , 31 , 50 ). We tested the sequence-specific DNA-binding ability of the full-length Sox30 protein by EMSA using one of the amplified oligonucleotides as a probe. Incubation with either the GST-Sox30 fusion or the full-length in vitro translation product of Sox30 resulted in a specific DNA-protein complex ( Fig. 5 and data not shown). This complex formation was inhibited by addition of an excess amount of wild-type oligonucleotide but not by the mutant. Furthermore, anti-Sox30 antibody was able to induce a supershift of this complex ( Fig. 5 ). These results indicated that Sox30 specifically binds the ACAAT motif. This binding was observed when poly(dG-dC) was used as a non-specific competitor but it was inhibited by poly(dl-dC) (data not shown). Such inhibition has also been reported in the case of Sox9 ( 7 ). This may be due to the fact that the HMG box contacts several A-T pairs in the minor groove of the DNA helix, as I-C pairs are known to mimic T-A pairs in the minor groove, whereas G-C pairs do not.Sequence-specific binding by Sox30 to the ACAAT motif. In vitro translated full-length Sox30 protein was subjected to EMSA. Unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were included (indicated by triangles) in binding reactions at 100-or 300-fold molar excess over probe oligonucleotide. An aliquot of 1 μl of either antiserum or preimmune serum was added before addition of probe. A filled triangle indicates addition of wild-type ACAAT-containing oligonucleotide, while an open triangle indicates addition of mutant oligonucleotide (see Materials and Methods). A filled arrow indicates a Sox30-DNA complex and an open arrow indicates a supershifted Sox30-DNA complex resulting from addition of anti-Sox30 antibody.Consensus sequence for the Sox30 binding siteWe then tested the transcriptional activity of Sox30. For this purpose, we used reporter plasmids containing one, four and eight copies of the Sox30-binding sequence. Co-transfection of a reporter containing eight copies of the Sox30-binding sequence with either type I or type II Sox30 expression vector into CV-1 cells revealed that only type I was able to activate transcription from the reporter ( Fig. 6A ). This activation appears dependent on Sox30-binding sequence as transcription from the control reporter was not activated significantly. The level of activation was dependent on the amount of the expression vector and on the copy number of the Sox30-binding sequence ( Fig. 6B and C ). Four copies of the Sox30-binding site were sufficient to observe activation by Sox30 ( Fig. 6C ). Transcriptional activation by Sox30 type I was observed not only in CV-1 cells but also in other cells such as CHO and JEG-3 cells (data not shown). In contrast, the shorter variant of Sox30 (type II) was not capable of activating transcription, although its expression level and nuclear localization were comparable to type I ( Fig. 4B ), indicating that the C-terminus of Sox30 is required for its activity. However, the C-terminal sequence alone was not sufficient to promote transcriptional activation when tested in the form of a fusion to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. Furthermore, neither expression of the Gal4-fused N-terminal sequence alone nor co-expression of N-and C-terminal sequences could activate transcription (data not shown), indicating a requirement for an intact overall structure for activation of transcription by Sox30.In this paper we isolated and characterized a novel SRY -related gene, Sox30 , which encodes a sequence-specific transcriptional activator. To date, Sox genes are categorized into seven subgroups on the basis of their homology within the HMG box ( 4 , 5 ). Due to the heterogeneity of the Sox30 HMG box which distinguishes it from other Sox proteins and the lack of any significant similarity outside of the HMG box, we classified Sox30 into a novel subgroup H: A, SRY ; B, Sox1-3 and 14 , zebrafish Sox19, Dichaete (fishhook) ; C, Sox4, 11, 19 and 22 , mouse Sox12 , rainbow trout Sox24 ; D, Sox5, 6 and 13 , rainbow trout Sox23 and SoxLZ, Xenopus Sox12 ; E, Sox8-10 and 21 ; F, Sox7, 17 and 18 ; G, Sox12, 15, 16 and 20 ; H, Sox30. The nomenclature is somewhat misleading and it should be noted that human Sox12 belongs to subgroup G while mouse Sox12 is in C and Xenopus Sox12 in D. Mouse Sox19 belongs to subgroup C, but zebrafish Sox19 to B.We assigned the human and mouse Sox30 to chromosomes 5q33 and 11, respectively. The Sox genes have been shown to be distributed throughout the genome with apparent lack of gene clusters. We compared our interspecific map of chromosome 11 with a composite mouse linkage map that shows the location of many uncloned mouse mutations (provided from the Mouse Genome Database maintained at The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Sox30 maps in a region of the composite map that so far lacks mouse mutations with a defect of spermatogenesis, which might be expected for an alteration of this locus (data not shown). However, in humans, recent deletion mapping revealed two types of chromosome 5 abnormalities in male germ cell tumors, genetic monosomy and regional deletion at 5pl5.1-15.2, 5q11 and 5q34-35 ( 51 ). Therefore loss of genetic information on chromosome 5 appears closely linked to tumor development. It remains to be determined whether deletions or mutations of Sox30 are present in male germ cell tumors.Transcriptional activities of Sox30 proteins. (A) Transcriptional activities of type I and type II Sox30 proteins. Aliquots of 2 μg of reporter plasmids were transfected into CV-1 cells together with 5 μg of type I or type II Sox30 expression vector. The fold activations were calculated by setting the luciferase activity of each reporter plasmid in the absence of Sox30 to 1.0 and then dividing the activity in the presence of Sox30 by that in its absence. All data are the averages with standard deviations of two independent assays. Each assay was performed in duplicate. (B) Dose-dependent transactivation by Sox30 type I. Aliquots of 2 μg of reporter plasmids were transfected into CV-1 cells together with various amounts of Sox30 expression vector. The luciferase activities were normalized for protein concentrations. All data are the averages with standard deviations of triplicate samples. (C) ACAAT motif-dependent transactivation by Sox30 type I. Aliquots of 2 μg of reporter plasmids containing various copy numbers of the ACAAT motif were transfected into CV-1 cells together with 5 μ g of Sox30 expression vector. All data are the averages with standard deviations of two independent assays. Each assay was performed in duplicate.The Sox30 protein was capable of binding DNA in a sequence-specific manner and activating transcription from a promoter containing its target sequence. Our oligonucleotide selection data showed that Sox30 prefers the ACAAT motif. The amplified consensus binding sequence for Sox30 differed slightly from other Sox proteins, in that preference for a guanine residue was observed at the flanking sequences of the core ACAAT motif ( Table 1 ). Nevertheless, Sox30 was also capable of activating transcription from an AACAATA-containing promoter as well as a GACAATG-containing promoter, (125) 8 dN-luc (data not shown). This might be explained by subtle differences in binding specificity which are not significant for transactivation in vivo , but become critical under the repetitive selection conditions.During mammalian spermatogenesis, male germ cells undergo three major developmental events: the mitotic proliferation of spermatogonia, the meiotic division of spermato-cytes and the subsequent formation of haploid spermatids and their morphogenic change into sperm. Northern blot analysis strongly suggested that Sox30 is highly expressed in spermato-cytes or more differentiated cells. Other Sox family proteins, Sox5 and Sox 17, seem to be involved in distinct steps during spermatogenesis ( 9 , 31 ). Soxl7 is expressed in spermatogonia and its expression declines at the early pachytene spermatocyte stage and onward. Sox5 is highly expressed in early post-meiotic cells (round spermatids). It is interesting that these three Sox family proteins seem to be differentially expressed during spermatogenesis. Sox proteins are known to function cooperatively with other transcription factors ( 34 , 35 , 38 , 39 ) and, accordingly, a search for such partner factors and target genes should reveal the function of these genes in more detail.We thank H.
