32219030,Integrative analysis reveals pathways associated with sex reversal in Cynoglossus semilaevis.,"Ye Z, Wang W, Zhang Y, Wang L, Cui Y, Li H",PeerJ. 2020 Mar 19;8:e8801. doi: 10.7717/peerj.8801. eCollection 2020.,"Sex reversal is a complex biological phenomenon exhibited by Cynoglossus semilaevis. Some genetic females may irreversibly convert to pseudomales, thus increasing aquaculture costs because males grow much more slowly than females. In this study, an integrative analysis of transcriptome and proteome was performed to compare differences in gene and protein expression in females and pseudomales after gonad differentiation in C. semilaevis. Based on RNA-Seq results, 1893 genes showed differences in expression at the transcript level between females and pseudomales. Of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), zona pellucida sperm-binding protein 4-like (LOC103393374 , ZP4), zona pellucida sperm-binding protein 4-like (LOC103396071, ZP4) and forkhead box L2 (foxl2) were highly expressed in females and doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1(dmrt1) and doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 3 (dmrt3) were highly expressed in pseudomales. GO enrichment analysis results indicate that wnt signaling pathways and oocyte maturation are two terms enriched in female. At the protein level, Tandem Mass Tags analysis revealed that 324 proteins differed in their relative abundance between pseudomales and females. KEGG analysis found that pseudo-highly expressed proteins were enriched in the ubiquitin mediated proteolysis pathway. For integrative analysis, the Spearman correlation coefficient between the transcriptome and proteome was 0.59. Among 52 related genes, 46 DEGs (88%) were well matched in their levels of change in protein abundance. These findings reveal major active pathways in female and pseudomale gonads after sex reversal and provide new insights into molecular mechanisms associated with sex reversal regulatory network."
31824559,"Transcriptome of Gonads From High Temperature Induced Sex Reversal During Sex Determination and Differentiation in Chinese Tongue Sole, Cynoglossus semilaevis.","Wang Q, Liu K, Feng B, Zhang Z, Wang R, Tang L, Li W, Li Q, Piferrer F, Shao C",Front Genet. 2019 Nov 22;10:1128. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2019.01128. eCollection 2019.,"The sex of Chinese tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) is determined by both genetic sex determination (GSD) and environmental sex determination (ESD), making it an ideal model to study the relationship between sex-determination and temperature. In the present study, transcriptomes of undifferentiated gonads from genetic females and males, as well as differentiated gonads from males, females, and pseudomales under high and normal temperature treatments were generated for comparative transcriptomic analysis. A mean of 68.24 M high-quality clean reads was obtained for each library. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between different sexes and environmental treatments were identified, revealing that the heat shock protein gene family was involved in the high temperature induced sex reversal. The Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways that were enriched in pseudomale and genetic female comparison included neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, cortisol synthesis and secretion, and steroid hormone biosynthesis. Furthermore, weighted gene co-expression network analyses were conducted on all samples, and two modules were positive correlated with pseudomale under high temperature. An illustrated protein-protein interaction map of the module identified a hub gene, hsc70. These findings provide insights into the genetic network that is involved in sex determination and sexual differentiation, and improve our understanding of genes involved in sex reversal under high temperature."
31191622,Transcriptome Profiling Insights the Feature of Sex Reversal Induced by High Temperature in Tongue Sole Cynoglossus semilaevis.,"Liu J, Liu X, Jin C, Du X, He Y, Zhang Q",Front Genet. 2019 May 29;10:522. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2019.00522. eCollection 2019.,"Sex reversal induced by temperature change is a common feature in fish. Usually, the sex ratio shift occurs when temperature deviates too much from normal during embryogenesis or sex differentiation stages. Despite decades of work, the mechanism of how temperature functions during early development and sex reversal remains mysterious. In this study, we used Chinese tongue sole as a model to identify features from gonad transcriptomic and epigenetic mechanisms involved in temperature induced masculinization. Some of genetic females reversed to pseudomales after high temperature treatment which caused the sex ratio imbalance. RNA-seq data showed that the expression profiles of females and males were significantly different, and set of genes showed sexually dimorphic expression. The general transcriptomic feature of pesudomales was similar with males, but the genes involved in spermatogenesis and energy metabolism were differentially expressed. In gonads, the methylation level of cyp19a1a promoter was higher in females than in males and pseudomales. Furthermore, high-temperature treatment increased the cyp19a1a promoter methylation levels of females. We observed a significant negative correlation between methylation levels and expression of cyp19ala. In vitro study showed that CpG within the cAMP response element (CRE) of the cyp19a1a promoter was hypermethylated, and DNA methylation decreased the basal and forskolin-induced activities of cyp19a1a promoter. These results suggested that epigenetic change, i.e., DNA methylation, which regulate the expression of cyp19a1a might be the mechanism for the temperature induced masculinization in tongue sole. It may be a common mechanism in teleost that can be induced sex reversal by temperature."

Epub 2018 Dec 21.,"Lhx9 is a LIM-homeodomain protein related to gonad development and sex reversal. In this study, we cloned and characterized CS-Lhx9 in the gonads of the Chinese tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis). The full-length cDNA of CS-Lhx9 was 3123bp, including an ORF of 1149bp encoding 383 amino acids which contains two LIM domains and a homeobox domain. CS-Lhx9 transcripts were primarily observed in the testis of male and neomale at 1yah, but nearly undetectable in the ovary. During the development of gonad, CS-Lhx9 exhibited an increasing trend and appeared to reach its peak value of expression in testis at 1yah. In situ hybridization was performed in male and neomale gonads at 210dah and 1yah. The results showed strong CS-Lhx9 signals in the spermatids and spermatozoa (germ cells). Methylation level of CS-Lhx9 promoter was higher in female and lower in male and neomale gonads, showing a negative correlation with CS-Lhx9 expression."
30093666,New locus reveals the genetic architecture of sex reversal in the Chinese tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis).,"Cui Y, Wang W, Ma L, Jie J, Zhang Y, Wang H, Li H",Heredity (Edinb). 2018 Oct;121(4):319-326. doi: 10.1038/s41437-018-0126-6. Epub 2018 Aug 9.,"Sex reversal in insects, amphibians, reptiles, and fishes is a complicated and interesting biological phenomenon. Sex reversal changes the sex ratio of populations and may complicate breeding schemes. In the Chinese tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis), genetic females may change into pseudomales, thereby increasing aquaculture costs because of the lower growth rate of the males than that of the females. Here we identify a new locus associated with sex reversal; this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is located in the third intron of the doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1 (Dmrt1) gene on the Z chromosome (named Cyn_Z_8564889) and has two alleles, A and G. Cyn_Z_8564889 regulates sex reversal interactively with our previously detected SNP (Cyn_Z_6676874), with the genetic females simultaneously carrying the T allele of Cyn_Z_6676874 and the A allele of Cyn_Z_8564889 changing into pseudomales. Other Dmrt1 polymorphisms were detected, which formed two haplotypes. Two SNPs in the second exon of Dmrt1 result in amino acid changes, suggesting that Dmrt1 is essential in sex reversal. We also verified that pseudomales produce no or little W sperm. The interaction and linkage between Cyn_Z_6676874 and Cyn_Z_8564889 and the absence of W sperm from pseudomales unravel the genetic architecture of sex reversal in C. semilaevis."
29155330,Expression pattern and functional analysis of R-spondin1 in tongue sole Cynoglossus semilaevis.,"Liu J, Liu T, Niu J, Wu X, Zhai J, Zhang Q, Qi J",Gene. 2018 Feb 5;642:453-460. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2017.11.047. Epub 2017 Nov 16.,"R-spondin 1 (Rspo1) is a potential female-determining gene in mammals that could regulate the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. The deletion of Rspo1 causes sex reversal in females. To investigate sexual determination and differentiation, we cloned and analyzed the Rspo1 gene in Cynoglossus semilaevis. Phylogenetic and gene structure analyses revealed that Rspo1 gene exhibited high sequence conservation and contained an N-terminal signal peptide, two furin-like cysteine-rich domains (FU1 and FU2), a thrombospondin type 1 repeat, and a C-terminal region enriched with basic charged amino acids. qRT-PCR revealed that Rspo1 expressed sexual dimorphism in gonad, with higher expression levels in the ovary than in the testis, thus, suggesting the involvement of Rspo1 in gonad differentiation. In situ hybridization results demonstrated that Rspo1 was expressed in premature germ cells, including spermatogonia and spermatocytes in the testis and stage II and stage III oocytes in the ovary. The methylation levels in two CpG sites of Rspo1 promoter significantly differed among females, males, and pseudomales. After 30days of exposure to high temperature, the expression of Rspo1 significantly decreased in female individuals, some of which were prone to males. However, no difference of Rspo1 gene expression was observed between the control group and high-temperature group in males. These preliminary findings suggested that Rspo1 played a crucial role in sex determination and development. This study laid the groundwork for further sex control breeding techniques in C. semilaevis."
28007836,Single Locus Maintains Large Variation of Sex Reversal in Half-Smooth Tongue Sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis).,"Jiang L, Li H",G3 (Bethesda). 2017 Feb 9;7(2):583-589. doi: 10.1534/g3.116.036822.,"Sex determination is a fundamental biological process for individual sex development and population sex ratios. However, for some species, the primary sex might be altered during development, and individuals can develop into the opposite sex. Sex reversal may happen in insects, reptiles, amphibians, and fishes. In half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis), some genetically female fish irreversibly reverse to pseudomales, resulting in higher costs in aquaculture owing to a lower growth rate of male fish during a 2-yr growth period. Here, we identified a locus with large controlling effect on sex reversal in the half-smooth tongue sole through genome-wide association study with high-density single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This SNP is located at the third intron of the F-box and leucine rich repeat protein 17 (FBXL17) gene on the Z chromosome, and it has two alleles, A and T. Genetic females with Z(A)W genotypes will never reverse into phenotypic males, but those with Z(T)W genotypes can sometimes undergo sex reversal. This SNP explains 82.7% of the genetic variation, or 58.4% of the phenotypic variation. Based on our results, a reproductive management program could be developed to improve the phenotypic female ratio in aquaculture, and elucidate the mechanism of sex reversal in half-smooth tongue sole. We expect that these findings will have a substantial impact on the population management in many harvested species where sex reversal occurs."
25724869,Establishment and characterization of a gonad cell line from half-smooth tongue sole Cynoglossus semilaevis pseudomale.,"Sun A, Chen SL, Gao FT, Li HL, Liu XF, Wang N, Sha ZX",Fish Physiol Biochem. 2015 Jun;41(3):673-83. doi: 10.1007/s10695-015-0037-x. Epub 2015 Feb 28.,"A new cell line was established from half-smooth tongue sole Cynoglossus semilaevis pseudomale gonad (CSPMG). Primary culture was initiated from gonad tissues pieces, and the CSPMG cells were cultured at 24 degrees C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium/F12 medium (1:1) (pH7.0), supplemented with 20 % fetal bovine serum, basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-I, 2-mercaptoethanol, penicillin and streptomycin. The cultured CSPMG cells, in fibroblast shape, proliferated to 100 % confluency 10 days later and had been subcultured to passage 109. Chromosome analyses indicated that the CSPMG cells exhibited chromosomal aneuploidy with a modal chromosome number of 42, which displayed the normal diploid karyotype of half-smooth tongue sole (2n = 42t, NF = 42). Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed CSPMG cells could express gonad somatic cell functional genes Sox9a, Wt1a and weakly germ cell marker gene Vasa, but not male specific gene Dmrt1. Transfection experiment demonstrated that CSPMG cells transfected with pEGFP-N3 plasmid and small RNA could express green and red fluorescence signals with high transfection efficiency. In conclusion, a continuous CSPMG cell line has been established successfully. The cell line might serve as a valuable tool for studies on the mechanism of sex determination, sex reversal and gonad development in flatfish."
24768058,"Molecular characterization, sexually dimorphic expression, and functional analysis of 3'-untranslated region of vasa gene in half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis).","Huang J, Chen S, Liu Y, Shao C, Lin F, Wang N, Hu Q",Theriogenology. 2014 Jul 15;82(2):213-24. doi: 10.1016/j.theriogenology.2014.03.017. Epub 2014 Mar 31.,"Vasa is a highly conserved ATP-dependent RNA helicase expressed mainly in germ cells. The vasa gene plays a crucial role in the development of germ cell lineage and has become an excellent molecular marker in identifying germ cells in teleosts. However, little is known about the structure and function of the vasa gene in flatfish. In this study, the vasa gene (Csvasa) was isolated and characterized in half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis), an economically important flatfish in China. In the obtained 6425-bp genomic sequence, 23 exons and 22 introns were identified. The Csvasa gene encodes a 663-amino acid protein, including highly conserved domains of the DEAD-box protein family. The amino acid sequence also shared a high homology with other teleosts. Csvasa expression was mainly restricted to the gonads, with little or no expression in other tissues. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that Csvasa expression levels decreased during embryonic and early developmental stages and increased with the primordial germ cell proliferation. A typical sexually dimorphic expression pattern of Csvasa was observed during early development and sex differentiation, suggesting that the Csvasa gene might play a differential role in the proliferation and differentiation of male and female primordial germ cells (PGCs). Csvasa mRNA expression levels in neomales were significantly lower than those in normal males and females, indicating that the Csvasa gene might be implicated in germ cell development after sex reversal by temperature treatment. In addition, medaka (Oryzias latipes) PGCs could be transiently labeled by microinjection of synthesized mRNA containing the green fluorescence protein gene and 3'-untranslated region of Csvasa, which confirmed that the Csvasa gene has the potential to be used as a visual molecular marker of germ cells and laid a foundation for manipulation of PGCs in tongue sole reproduction."
24487721,Epigenetic modification and inheritance in sexual reversal of fish.,"Shao C, Li Q, Chen S, Zhang P, Lian J, Hu Q, Sun B, Jin L, Liu S, Wang Z, Zhao H, Jin Z, Liang Z, Li Y, Zheng Q, Zhang Y, Wang J, Zhang G",Genome Res. 2014 Apr;24(4):604-15. doi: 10.1101/gr.162172.113. Epub 2014 Feb 2.,"Environmental sex determination (ESD) occurs in divergent, phylogenetically unrelated taxa, and in some species, co-occurs with genetic sex determination (GSD) mechanisms. Although epigenetic regulation in response to environmental effects has long been proposed to be associated with ESD, a systemic analysis on epigenetic regulation of ESD is still lacking. Using half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) as a model-a marine fish that has both ZW chromosomal GSD and temperature-dependent ESD-we investigated the role of DNA methylation in transition from GSD to ESD. Comparative analysis of the gonadal DNA methylomes of pseudomale, female, and normal male fish revealed that genes in the sex determination pathways are the major targets of substantial methylation modification during sexual reversal. Methylation modification in pseudomales is globally inherited in their ZW offspring, which can naturally develop into pseudomales without temperature incubation. Transcriptome analysis revealed that dosage compensation occurs in a restricted, methylated cytosine enriched Z chromosomal region in pseudomale testes, achieving equal expression level in normal male testes. In contrast, female-specific W chromosomal genes are suppressed in pseudomales by methylation regulation. We conclude that epigenetic regulation plays multiple crucial roles in sexual reversal of tongue sole fish. We also offer the first clues on the mechanisms behind gene dosage balancing in an organism that undergoes sexual reversal. Finally, we suggest a causal link between the bias sex chromosome assortment in the offspring of a pseudomale family and the transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of sexual reversal in tongue sole fish."
