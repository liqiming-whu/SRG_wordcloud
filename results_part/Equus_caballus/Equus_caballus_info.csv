32865132,Molecular screening of XY SRY-negative sex reversal cases in horses revealed anomalies in amelogenin testing.,"Martinez MM, Costa M, Ratti C",J Vet Diagn Invest. 2020 Aug 31:1040638720952380. doi: 10.1177/1040638720952380.,"Male-to-female sex reversal in horses is a developmental disorder in which phenotypic females have a male genetic constitution. Male-to-female sex reversal is the second most common genetic sex abnormality, after X chromosome monosomy. All male-to-female sex reversal cases studied to date have been found to be infertile. Therefore, a screening test is particularly useful in laboratories doing DNA genotyping in horses. Our laboratory has tested > 209,000 horses for parentage using a panel of microsatellite markers and the sex marker gene amelogenin (AMEL). Suspect XY sex reversal cases are reported females with a male profile by AMEL testing. After routine genotyping, 49 cases were detected and further tested using the sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene, confirming the XY SRY-negative genotype of suspect sex reversal cases. When some inconsistencies arose in the initial result, a molecular panel of X- and Y-linked markers was analyzed for these samples. Of the 49 cases, 33 were confirmed as XY SRY-negative. The remaining 16 cases were identified as false-positives as a result of anomalies of AMEL testing in horses."
31793061,Application of droplet digital PCR in diagnosing of X monosomy in mares.,"Szczerbal I, Nowacka-Woszuk J, Kopp-Kuhlman C, Mackowski M, Switonski M",Equine Vet J. 2020 Jul;52(4):627-631. doi: 10.1111/evj.13214. Epub 2020 Feb 12.,"BACKGROUND: X monosomy is the most common disorder of sex development in horses. Although cytogenetic analysis is still the gold standard in the diagnosis of equine X monosomy, novel molecular techniques are being sought to quickly and reliably detect this chromosome abnormality. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of a novel variant of the PCR technique-namely, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)-in the detection of X monosomy in mares. STUDY DESIGN: A proof of concept of the usefulness of ddPCR in diagnosing an abnormal number of X chromosomes in mares. METHODS: We examined an infertile mare using cytogenetic (fluorescent in situ hybridisation-FISH) and molecular (droplet digital PCR-ddPCR) techniques. The X chromosome copy number in ddPCR was estimated via detection of the AMELX gene copy number. In addition, 70 mares homozygous for X-linked microsatellite marker (LEX3) were examined by ddPCR. For all mares, a PCR search for the Y-linked SRY gene was also performed. RESULTS: Cytogenetic analysis and ddPCR gave concordant results, indicating pure X monosomy in the studied mare. Of the 70 additional mares examined by ddPCR, a single copy of the X chromosome was found in two cases. All mares were SRY-negative and thus both freemartinism, manifested by leucocyte XX/XY chimerism, and sex reversal syndrome (XX, SRY-positive) could be excluded. MAIN LIMITATIONS: The ddPCR approach does not allow for unequivocal identification of mosaicism (63,X/64,XX or 65,XXX/64,XX), but may give an indication that further cytogenetic analysis is necessary. CONCLUSION: The ddPCR approach appeared to be useful for diagnosing nonmosaic X monosomy in mares. If the number of X chromosome copies in a mare, as determined by ddPCR, differs from two (in our study, <1.8 or >2.2), additional cytogenetic investigation is recommended with the aim of detecting the mosaicism."
28958500,Using RNA-seq to determine patterns of sex-bias in gene expression in the brain of the sex-role reversed Gulf Pipefish (Syngnathus scovelli).,"Beal AP, Martin FD, Hale MC",Mar Genomics. 2018 Feb;37:120-127. doi: 10.1016/j.margen.2017.09.005. Epub 2017 Sep 22.,"Sex-bias in gene expression is a widespread mechanism for controlling the development of phenotypes that differ between males and females. Most studies on sex-bias in gene expression have focused on species that exhibit traditional sex-roles (male-male competition and female parental care). By contrast the Syngnathid fishes (sea horses, pipefish, and sea dragons) are a group of organisms where many species exhibit male brooding and sex-role reversal (female-female competition for mates and paternal parental care), and little is known about how patterns of sex-bias in gene expression vary in species with sex-role reversal. Here we utilize RNA-seq technology to investigate patterns of sex-bias in gene expression in the brain tissue of the Gulf Pipefish (Syngnathus scovelli) a species that exhibits sex-role reversal. Gene expression analysis identified 73 sex-biased genes, 26 genes upregulated in females and 47 genes upregulated in males. Gene ontology analysis found 52 terms enriched for the sex-biased genes in a wide range of pathways suggesting that multiple functions and processes differ between the sexes. We focused on two areas of interest: sex steroids/hormones and circadian rhythms, both of which exhibited sex-bias in gene expression, and are known to influence sexual development in other species. Lastly, the work presented herein contributes to a growing body of genome data available for the Syngnathids, increasing our knowledge on patterns of gene expression in these unusual fishes."
28224649,Sex chromosomal abnormalities associated with equine infertility: validation of a simple molecular screening tool in the Purebred Spanish Horse.,"Anaya G, Molina A, Valera M, Moreno-Millan M, Azor P, Peral-Garcia P, Demyda-Peyras S",Anim Genet. 2017 Aug;48(4):412-419. doi: 10.1111/age.12543. Epub 2017 Feb 22.,"Chromosomal abnormalities in the sex chromosome pair (ECAX and ECAY) are widely associated with reproductive problems in horses. However, a large proportion of these abnormalities remains undiagnosed due to the lack of an affordable diagnostic tool that allows for avoiding karyotyping tests. Hereby, we developed an STR (single-tandem-repeat)-based molecular method to determine the presence of the main sex chromosomal abnormalities in horses in a fast, cheap and reliable way. The frequency of five ECAX-linked (LEX026, LEX003, TKY38, TKY270 and UCDEQ502) and two ECAY-linked (EcaYH12 and SRY) markers was characterized in 261 Purebred Spanish Horses to determine the efficiency of the methodology developed to be used as a chromosomal diagnostic tool. All the microsatellites analyzed were highly polymorphic, with a sizeable number of alleles (polymorphic information content > 0.5). Based on this variability, the methodology showed 100% sensitivity and 99.82% specificity to detect the most important sex chromosomal abnormalities reported in horses (chimerism, Turner's syndrome and sex reversal syndromes). The method was also validated with 100% efficiency in 10 individuals previously diagnosed as chromosomally aberrant. This STR screening panel is an efficient and reliable molecular-cytogenetic tool for the early detection of sex chromosomal abnormalities in equines that could be included in breeding programs to save money, effort and time of veterinary practitioners and breeders."
26430891,Porcine SOX9 Gene Expression Is Influenced by an 18 bp Indel in the 5'-Untranslated Region.,"Brenig B, Duan Y, Xing Y, Ding N, Huang L, Schutz E",PLoS One. 2015 Oct 2;10(10):e0139583. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0139583. eCollection 2015.,"Sex determining region Y-box 9 (SOX9) is an important regulator of sex and skeletal development and is expressed in a variety of embryonal and adult tissues. Loss or gain of function resulting from mutations within the coding region or chromosomal aberrations of the SOX9 locus lead to a plethora of detrimental phenotypes in humans and animals. One of these phenotypes is the so-called male-to-female or female-to-male sex-reversal which has been observed in several mammals including pig, dog, cat, goat, horse, and deer. In 38,XX sex-reversal French Large White pigs, a genome-wide association study suggested SOX9 as the causal gene, although no functional mutations were identified in affected animals. However, besides others an 18 bp indel had been detected in the 5'-untranslated region of the SOX9 gene by comparing affected animals and controls. We have identified the same indel (Delta18) between position +247 bp and +266 bp downstream the transcription start site of the porcine SOX9 gene in four other pig breeds; i.e., German Large White, Laiwu Black, Bamei, and Erhualian. These animals have been genotyped in an attempt to identify candidate genes for porcine inguinal and/or scrotal hernia. Because the 18 bp segment in the wild type 5'-UTR harbours a highly conserved cAMP-response element (CRE) half-site, we analysed its role in SOX9 expression in vitro. Competition and immunodepletion electromobility shift assays demonstrate that the CRE half-site is specifically recognized by CREB. Both binding of CREB to the wild type as well as the absence of the CRE half-site in Delta18 reduced expression efficiency in HEK293T, PK-15, and ATDC5 cells significantly. Transfection experiments of wild type and Delta18 SOX9 promoter luciferase constructs show a significant reduction of RNA and protein levels depending on the presence or absence of the 18 bp segment. Hence, the data presented here demonstrate that the 18 bp indel in the porcine SOX9 5'-UTR is of functional importance and may therefore indeed be a causative variation in SOX9 associated traits."

Epub 2014 Oct 5.,"Horses are characterized as having a greater rate of chromosomal abnormalities than other species, which are mainly related to the sex chromosome pair and produce a series of different anomalies known as disorders in sexual development (DSD). In the present study, three Pura Raza Espanola (PRE) and one Menorquin (MEN) horses were studied and an incompatibility in their genetic and phenotypic sex were detected. Animals were karyotyped by conventional and molecular cytogenetic analyses and characterized using genomic techniques. Although all individuals, were totally unrelated, these animals had the same abnormality (64,XY SRY negative DSD) despite having an anatomically normal external mare phenotype. Therefore, this syndrome could remain undiagnosed in a large percentage of cases because the physiological and morphological symptoms are rare. In the present study, a slight gonadal dysgenesis was observed only in older individuals. Interestingly this chromosomal abnormality has been previously reported less than twenty times, and never in the PRE or MEN horses. With the present research, it is demonstrated that the use of genetic and cytogenetic diagnostic tools in veterinary practice could be an important complementary test to determine the origin of unexplained reproductive failures among horses."
24973322,[Cytogenetical and molecular analyses in a horse with SRY-negative sex reversal].,"Pienkowska-Schelling A, Becker D, Bracher V, Pineroli B, Schelling C",Schweiz Arch Tierheilkd. 2014 Jul;156(7):341-4. doi: 10.1024/0036-7281/a000604.,"Numerical and structural aberrations of chromosomes may cause malformations, embryonal losses and reduced or missing fertility. In male horses the fertility is rather well controlled through their semen evaluation. For mares there are no mandatory regulations which specify their use in a breeding programme. Therefore, mares with chromosomal aberrations, which exclude reproduction success may be chosen for breeding. The present case describes a horse, offically registered as a female, which was presented for a breeding exam. On this occasion, small and inactive ovaries were diagnosed. Although the cytogenetical analysis excluded a numerical or gross structural chromosome aberration, the karyotype (64,XY) corresponded to the male sex. The diagnosis male to female sex-reversal (SRY-negative) excludes reproductive success for this horse. This case underlines the importance of a cytogenetic analysis for female horses, before they enter a breeding programme."

Epub 2012 May 23.,"Gonads are the only organs with 2 possible developmental pathways, testis or ovary. A consequence of this unique feature is that mutations in genes controlling gonad development give rise not only to gonadal malformation or dysfunction but also to frequent cases of sex reversal, including XY females, XX males and intersexes. Most of our current knowledge on mammalian sex determination, the genetic process by which the gonadal primordia are committed to differentiate as either testes or ovaries, has derived mainly from the study of sex-reversed mice obtained by direct genetic manipulation. However, there are also numerous cases of natural exceptions to normal gonad development which have been described in a variety of mammals, including both domestic and wild species. Here, we review the most relevant cases of: (1) natural, non-induced sex reversal and intersexuality described in laboratory rodents, including Sxr and B6-Y(DOM) mice; (2) sex reversal in domestic animals, including freemartinism in bovids and pigs, XX sex reversal in pigs, goats and dogs, XY sex reversal in the horse, and sex chromosome chimerism and sex reversal in the cat, and (3) sex reversal in wild mammals, including the generalised true hermaphroditism described in talpid moles, XY sex reversal in Akodon, Microtus and Dicrostonyx species, males lacking a Y chromosome and SRY in Ellobius lutescens, the X* chromosome of Myopus schisticolor, and sex chromosome mosaicism and X0 females in Microtus oregoni. These studies are necessary to elucidate particular aspects of mammalian gonad development in some instances and to understand how the genetic mechanisms controlling gonad development have evolved."
22025175,Molecular and cytogenetic studies in a case of XX SRY-negative sex reversal in an Arabian horse.,"Ciotola F, Albarella S, Pasolini MP, Auletta L, Esposito L, Iannuzzi L, Peretti V",Sex Dev. 2012;6(1-3):104-7. doi: 10.1159/000331480. Epub 2011 Oct 22.,"An 18-month-old Arabian foal characterized by a stallion-like appearance was submitted for cytogenetic and molecular genetics examinations due to abnormalities of external genitalia and the presence of ovotestis-like structures in the abdominal cavity. By RB-banding the animal showed the normal female equine karyotype (2n = 64,XX). Molecular analysis revealed the absence of the SRY and ZFY genes and the presence of ZFX, a typical female equine condition. The entire RSPO1 coding region was examined to exclude its involvement. Although a SNP was found in exon 3, it was not responsible for an amino acid substitution."
21070275,Molecular heterogeneity of XY sex reversal in horses.,"Raudsepp T, Durkin K, Lear TL, Das PJ, Avila F, Kachroo P, Chowdhary BP",Anim Genet. 2010 Dec;41 Suppl 2:41-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2052.2010.02101.x.,"Male-to-female 64,XY sex reversal is a frequently reported chromosome abnormality in horses. Despite this, the molecular causes of the condition are as yet poorly understood. This is partially because only limited molecular information is available for the horse Y chromosome (ECAY). Here, we used the recently developed ECAY map and carried out the first comprehensive study of the Y chromosome in XY mares (n=18). The integrity of the ECAY in XY females was studied by FISH and PCR using markers evenly distributed along the euchromatic region. The results showed that the XY sex reversal condition in horses has two molecularly distinct forms: (i) a Y-linked form that is characterized by Y chromosome deletions and (ii) a non-Y-linked form where the Y chromosome of affected females is molecularly the same as in normal males. Further analysis of the Y-linked form (13 cases) showed that the condition is molecularly heterogeneous: the smallest deletions spanned about 21 kb, while the largest involved the entire euchromatic region. Regardless of the size, all deletions included the SRY gene. We show that the deletions were likely caused by inter-chromatid recombination events between repeated sequences in ECAY. Further, we hypothesize that the occurrence of SRY-negative XY females in some species (horse, human) but not in others (pig, dog) is because of differences in the organization of the Y chromosome. Finally, in contrast to the Y-linked SRY-negative form of equine XY sex reversal, the molecular causes of SRY-positive XY mares (5 cases) remain as yet undefined."
17341020,[Intersexuality in horses].,"Kuiper H, Distl O",Dtsch Tierarztl Wochenschr. 2007 Feb;114(2):50-6.,"Intersexuality is a rare congenital anomaly of horses. Diagnosis of intersexuality is difficult because there are usually no specific changes in the reproductive tract visible. During a period of five years, ten patients with reduced fertility or suspected intersexuality respectively were investigated using cytogenetic, molecular genetic, histopathological and endocrinological methods. In one case a 64,XX/63,X0 mosaicism was found. In six cases male pseudohermaphroditism was verified. These patients showed a male karyotype, testes and rudimentary parts of a female reproductive tract were present. One horse was suspected to be a male pseudohermaphrodite but the gonads were not examined. One horse was suspected to be affected by an XX-sex several syndrome and in one case a SRY-negative XY-sex reversal syndrome was most likely. In the case of an XX-sex reversal syndrome, there is a female chromosomal constitution, an uterus and cranial parts of the vagina are present but also testes tissue and possibly an enlarged penis like clitoris. Here an XX-sex reversal syndrome was suspected but not confirmed as it was not possible to examine the gonads and verify tissue from testes. Therefore a pseudohermaphroditismus femininus could not be excluded. In cases of XY-sex reversal syndrome the patients show a male chromosomal constitution, parts of a female reproductive tract but no testes tissue is present. For the horse described here, a deletion of the SRY gene was the most likely cause for the XY-sex reversal syndrome."

Epub 2005 Dec 28.,"A female American saddlebred horse was presented for surgical correction of a possible pseudohermaphrodite condition. The horse had abnormal external genitalia and exhibited stallion-like behaviour. No evidence of uterine or ovarian tissue was identified on laparoscopic examination, but hypoplastic testicular-like tissue was removed, although this was found to contain no spermatogonia upon histopathological examination. A karyotype was performed and showed the normal chromosomal complement for a female horse (64,XX). Polymerase chain reaction to detect the SRY gene was negative in peripheral blood as well as the testicular-like tissue. This case represents the first report of an SRY negative XX-male sex reversal intersex phenotype, which is a potentially inherited condition, in an American saddlebred horse."
16267164,Exclusion of candidate genes for canine SRY-negative XX sex reversal.,"Kothapalli K, Kirkness E, Pujar S, Van Wormer R, Meyers-Wallen VN",J Hered. 2005;96(7):759-63. doi: 10.1093/jhered/esi129. Epub 2005 Nov 2.,"In mammals, the Y-linked SRY gene is normally responsible for testis induction, yet testis development can occur in the absence of Y-linked genes, including SRY. The canine model of SRY-negative XX sex reversal could lead to the discovery of novel genes in the mammalian sex determination pathway. The autosomal genes causing testis induction in this disorder in dogs, humans, pigs, and horses are presently unknown. In goats, a large deletion is responsible for sex reversal linked to the polled (hornless) phenotype. However, this region has been excluded as being causative of the canine disorder, as have WT1 and DMRT1 in more recent studies. The purpose of this study was to determine whether microsatellite marker alleles near or within five candidate genes (GATA4, FOG2, LHX1, SF1, SOX9) are associated with the affected phenotype in a pedigree of canine SRY-negative XX sex reversal. Primer sequences flanking nucleotide repeats were designed within genomic sequences of canine candidate gene homologues. Fluorescence-labeled polymorphic markers were used to screen a subset of the multigenerational pedigree, and marker alleles were determined by software. Our results indicate that the mutation causing canine SRY-negative XX sex reversal in this pedigree is unlikely to be located in regions containing these candidates."

The PCR amplification of the SRY and ZFY genes showed the presence of both those genes, while the endocrinological study demonstrated a high level of testosterone (9.7 nmol/l). Sequencing of the SRY gene (1121 bp), comprising also 5'- and 3'-UTRs, did not reveal any differences when compared with the sequence of normal stallions.

The mare carriers of this syndrome lack of SRY gene. It is suggested that sex-reversal syndrome is probably caused by transfer of the SRY gene from Y to the X chromosome, due to abnormal meiotic exchange. The aim of the study was molecular analysis of the Y-linked genes in a case of the sex-reversed infertile mare with 64,XY karyotype. The karyotype was established on the basis of analysis of 350 metaphase spreads stained by CBG banding. Molecular analysis of the loci assigned to the Y chromosome revealed absence of the SRY gene and presence of the other studied loci (ZFY, AMEL-Y and STS-Y). In this animal all fragments representing X chromosome (ZFX, AMEL-X and STS-X) were detected. External genitalia in the mare were normal, uterus was small and ovaries (examined by ultrasonography) extremely small. The mechanism of sex-reversal syndrome formation was discussed. It is postulated that during spermatogenesis in the sire two crossing-over events between the X and Y chromosomes occurred. One of them took place between the ZFY and SRY loci and another one between the SRY locus and the centromere."

Four classes were described, ranging from potentially fertile female (Class I) to virilized intersex (Class IV). In the present study, serum testosterone concentrations were measured in 29 sex-reversed XY mares, 3 normal mares and 3 normal stallions. Serums were obtained during the breeding season (March-August), and were stored at -70 C until assayed. Serum testosterone concentrations in the normal XX mares ranged from nondetectable to 0.41 ng/ml; in normal XY stallions, from 1.04 ng/ml to 2.4 ng/ml; and in XY mares, from nondetectable to 5.4 ng/ml. Sex reversed mares previously assigned to Class I or II had serum testosterone concentrations ranging from nondetectable to 0.22 ng/ml. Serum testosterone concentrations in XY mares were correlated with sex phenotype and behavior. Although the range of steroid concentrations among XY mares may be quantified more accurately with increased sampling, serum testosterone concentrations can be used currently as an added parameter for study of the sex reversed condition."

The syndrome is manifested by both genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity. The sex-reversed genetic condition occurs frequently within certain pedigrees where XY females have been found and can be readily detected by chromosome karyotyping. The phenotypic spectrum ranges from the feminine mare with a reproductive tract that is within normal limits to the greatly masculinized mare. Pedigree analysis suggests that there are two modes of inheritance: (1) an X-linked recessive or autosomal sex-limited dominant transmitted through the female and (2) an autosomal sex-limited dominant or a Y chromosomal mutation with variable expression transmitted through the male. The proportion of female to male progeny of the 69 top-producing Arabian stallions in the world is 53 to 47, indicating that the occurrence of genetic defects affecting the sex ratio such as the XY sex-reversal syndrome is relatively infrequent. In nine cases where the sex ratios of stallions deviated significantly from the expected sex ratio, the incidence of female infertility also increased. Cytogenetic screening of young animals would provide for early detection and avoid the expense and disappointment of continuous breeding attempts. Just as importantly, it would aid in the reduction and the possible elimination of this genetic condition from breeding herds."
